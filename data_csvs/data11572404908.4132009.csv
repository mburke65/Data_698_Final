Here's the latest:

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: 'I was on the phone call' with Trump and Ukrainian President

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo admitted Wednesday that he was on the July 25 phone call in which President Donald Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.

""I was on the phone call,"" Pompeo said Wednesday during a news conference in Rome with Italy's foreign minister.

Some key context: A whistleblower complaint released last week alleges Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the 2020 election and that the White House took steps to cover it up. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

A rough transcript released by the White House shows Trump repeatedly pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, Trump's potential 2020 political rival, and his son Hunter Biden.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.

State Department inspector general requests urgent briefing on Ukraine with congressional staff

The State Department's inspector general on Tuesday requested an urgent briefing with senior congressional staff members after Pompeo pushed back on House Democratic demands to turn over documents related to Ukraine and to depose current and former State officials, according to sources briefed on the matter.

It remains unclear exactly what State Department Inspector General Steve Linick plans to provide Congress during the private briefing Wednesday.

Deposition for House impeachment investigation delayed

The aide said on Tuesday the testimony of former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, which had been scheduled for Wednesday, would now occur Oct. 11, following an agreement between the committee's and the former ambassador's counsel.

Three committees -- the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight panels -- have scheduled the depositions as part of their probe into whether Trump solicited help from a foreign government to dig up dirt on his political opponent.

Yovanovitch and Volker were two of the five depositions that the committees have scheduled during the next two weeks while Congress is on recess.

Giuliani hires a Watergate prosecutor as his attorney in impeachment inquiry

Florida attorney Jon Sale , who worked as an assistant prosecutor on the legal team investigating the Watergate scandal, is representing Giuliani in the matter of the congressional impeachment inquiry, both of them confirmed to CNN on Tuesday.

Giuliani was subpoenaed on Monday by the three committees in the House of Representatives investigating Trump's interactions with the Ukrainian government. The subpoena requests documents and correspondence from Giuliani related to Ukraine.

As a reminder, the whistleblower complaint labels Giuliani as ""central figure"" in the controversy. US officials were concerned, the whistleblower said, with Giuliani and his contacts with Ukrainian officials.

Key GOP senator breaks with Trump in saying the whistleblower 'ought to be heard out and protected'

Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chamber's most senior Republican and a longtime defender of whistleblowers, rebuked Trump on Tuesday when he said the whistleblower at the center of the impeachment inquiry ""appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected.""

His comments mark a clear departure from Trump and his allies, who in recent days have repeatedly maligned the whistleblower's motives and pushed to reveal the individual's identity.

Ukraine's President says he never met with Giuliani

""I never met Rudy Giuliani -- never. And never had any phone calls with him,"" Zelensky said Tuesday at a news conference in Kiev.

According to the White House transcript of the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky, the Ukrainian President said he was aware of Giuliani's efforts to uncover information that would help Trump politically, and Trump encouraged Zelensky to speak with his lawyer because Giuliani ""very much knows what's happening.""

Pompeo accuses House Democrats of intimidation and bullying over Ukraine controversy

""I'm concerned with aspects of the Committee's request that can be understood only as an attempt to intimidate, bully, & treat improperly the distinguished professionals of the Department of State, including several career FSOs,"" he tweeted.

The comments prompted House Democrats to issue a stark warning to the top US diplomat. The chairmen of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees told Pompeo that any effort to prevent those officials from speaking to Congress ""is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry.""

CNN reported Monday that Pompeo was on Trump's July call with Zelensky despite previously denying knowledge of the whistleblower complaint.

How Lindsey Graham's support for Trump -- a man he once called a 'jackass' -- has evolved

Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is one of Trump's most vociferous defenders on Capitol Hill, but it wasn't always like that. In fact, Graham called Trump ""crazy and a ""jackass"" four years ago when he was running in the GOP presidential primary.

At the time, Trump wasn't so kind to Graham either, calling him a ""nut job.""

""This guy Lindsey Graham, he's one of the dumbest human beings I have ever seen,"" Trump said at a rally in South Carolina. ""He starts hitting me, saying vicious things, ends up with 0%. He left in disgrace.""

Don't assume the Senate would *never* impeach Trump

With the House headed down a path that virtually guarantees Trump will be impeached, conventional wisdom has settled on the idea that the Republican-led Senate will never, ever, remove him from office.

And, well, it's true that the strong likelihood is that the Senate acquits Trump, CNN's Chris Cillizza writes.

But if the Trump presidency -- and the way in which he became President -- teaches us anything, it should be this: Never assume. Anything.

Fact-checking Trump's false claim that the US is the only country providing aid to Ukraine

Trump has offered several explanations to justify his decision to delay military aid to Ukraine, first suggesting he was worried about ""corruption,"" then claiming the delay was a mechanism to pressure other countries to contribute.

On September 23, Trump voiced his complaint to reporters alongside Polish President Andrzej Duda, asking, ""Why is it always the United States spending money?"" and ""I don't like it that it's only us.""

Facts First: The US is not ""the only one"" contributing aid to Ukraine. Germany and France have both sent millions of euros to Ukraine, along with other European nations.

Connected by subpoenas: Giuliani and his Ukrainian middleman Lev Parnas face increased scrutiny

Parnas, a Ukrainian American businessman who has been subpoenaed as part of the House impeachment inquiry, has spent thousands of dollars on Trump properties and donated to the main super PAC supporting the President's reelection effort, according to documents produced in an unrelated federal lawsuit.

Starting in November 2018, Parnas introduced Giuliani to former and current Ukrainian officials, according to Giuliani.

Financial records uncovered as a result of a lawsuit filed in federal court in Florida earlier this year show Parnas spent thousands of dollars at Trump hotels in the fall of 2018, donated hundreds of thousands to the pro-Trump super PAC and received checks from Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm with deep connections to the Trump White House.

The financial ties between Trump's world and Parnas raise new questions about the nature of Parnas' relationship with Giuliani and who was paying the former New York mayor and Parnas for their research on Ukraine."

Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday released a new plan outlining how she would use the revenue generated by her proposed tax on ""excessive lobbying"" to beef up federal agencies charged with regulating major industries.",2019-10-02,CNN,Elizabeth Warren wants to tax the teeth out of corporate lobbying,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/02/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020-tax-lobbying/index.html,"(CNN) Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday released a new plan outlining how she would use the revenue generated by her proposed tax on ""excessive lobbying"" to beef up federal agencies charged with regulating major industries.

""This tax will reduce the incentive for excessive lobbying, and raise money that we can use to fight back against this kind of onslaught when it occurs,"" Warren wrote in a Medium post explaining the strategy.

First unveiled in broad strokes last month , Warren's plan would impose a 35% tax on lobbying expenditures between $500,000 and $1 million. The cost would escalate from there, with a 60% rate placed on every dollar beyond $1 million that rises to 75% once a company's lobbying costs surpass $5 million.

The proposal represents the newest piece of Warren's broad anti-corruption platform, which she has made central to her candidacy. It is the subject matter that Warren is most fluent in discussing and passionate about on the trail, where she often jokes that the ""good news"" is she has ""the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate,"" before waiting a beat and adding: ""Here's the bad news, we need the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate.""

In this chapter of her wider agenda, Warren stresses that the issue goes beyond Congress, lawmakers and the ""revolving door"" between Capitol Hill and K Street -- and addresses lobbyist influence on regulatory bodies.

W. Norton. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) If there's one thing that seems to scare Mark Zuckerberg to the bone, it's the threat of a functional government that represents the interests of its citizens. To him, government appears to be the faceless bureaucracy that slaps him on the wrist with a $5 billion fine when his company spies too much or too illegally on his users.

So when one of his employees asked him at an open meeting what he thought of Elizabeth Warren, Zuck was uncharacteristically candid -- as if triggered by the mere thought of the possibility that someone with so much faith in the power of big government could become our chief executive. She ""thinks the right answer is to break up the companies,"" he said . And even though he believes he would win a legal battle against the US government, he added, ""Does that still suck for us? Yes.""

Considering the company's actions over the past couple of years, this is a battle Zuckerberg has been anticipating and preparing for. Ever since the suggestion of breaking up Facebook was raised at the infamous congressional hearings Zuckerberg underwent in April 2018, he has been effectively circling the wagons.

Facebook's greatest vulnerability is the fact that it's not just one company, but a collection of different platforms and technologies they've purchased over the years. Breaking them up is as simple as, well, separating out these acquisitions. That's why his first move after Congress began asking questions was to integrate his various messaging platforms -- Instagram, WhatsApp -- into the Facebook platform. He argued that this was to offer greater interoperability and convenience. The real reason for such integration was to pre-empt any efforts to split up the company along its obvious fault lines.

Shortly after, Facebook announced it was going to launch a new cryptocurrency, already branded with a freedom-from-tyranny inspiring name, the ""Libra."" It has been widely assumed that Facebook's 2.4-billion user base would give the currency an instant edge over bitcoin and everybody else, perhaps even becoming a default global currency.

So, the new question becomes, will Zuckerberg peg the Libra on the dollar, supporting the United States' role as the world's most central banker? Or will the company base the Libra's value on a commodity, a basket of currencies, or something else entirely? The mere suggestion of such plans gives Facebook leverage over the government that might undertake to control it.

Would Zuckerberg really think and act this way? Of course he would. After all, as he told his gathering of employees, he's the one who sees this as a life-or-death battle: ""At the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.""

That's actually a scary thought to me. Facebook screwed up our 2016 elections -- and, arguably, civil society -- by serving as the unintentional conduit for divisive propaganda from near and far.

In a 2018 blog post , Facebook detailed how it planned to better prepare for future elections, which included identifying and removing fake accounts. So Facebook will begin using its employees' and AI's ""judgment"" to determine what sorts of messaging is appropriate for us.

Imagine how much influence the platform could have if its founder really perceived one of the candidates as an existential threat. Do we want to see what an election looks like where Facebook is actively involved, fighting for its life?

What Zuckerberg doesn't get is that Elizabeth Warren isn't simply protecting America from Facebook, but Facebook from itself. While government is responsible for making sure companies don't compete in unfair ways or infringe on people's basic civil liberties, it is also responsible for providing businesses with safe monetary and legal systems through which to operate.

As Warren tweeted , ""What would really 'suck' is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.""

Breaking up Facebook is far from the worst thing that could happen to the company. That would likely play out like the brooms in the Sorcerer's Apprentice, where each piece of the company animates and grows into its own threat to privacy and democracy. Instead of being bitten by a single great white shark, we get consumed by a thousand piranhas.

No, the real nightmare for Zuckerberg is not being broken up, but being regulated. And the more Facebook integrates its various pieces into one big platform, the easier it will be to monitor, legislate and penalize.

Regulation may be less dramatic than a breakup, but it's also more effective and ongoing. A living and perpetual responsibility. Facebook could grow so big and ubiquitous, it might even become a utility -- publicly owned and operated.

With her penchant for big government and detailed plans, Elizabeth Warren may be the only candidate willing to finally parent and discipline petulant CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg, who too easily mistake corporate power for personal liberty."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is leading in New Hampshire, slightly edging out Joe Biden (D) and leading Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) by double digits in the coveted early primary state, according to the Saint Anselm College Survey Center’s September poll released Tuesday.

The poll – which surveyed 423 registered New Hampshire voters likely to vote in the Democrat primary from September 25-29, 2019 – showed Warren leading the primary field with 25 percent support and Biden on her heels with 24 percent support. Sanders, however, struggled to keep up, falling to a distant third place with just 11 percent support.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) came in fourth place, just one point behind the socialist senator, with ten percent support. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) tumbled to fifth place, failing to garner double digits in the Granite State, seeing just five percent support.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MI) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) saw three percent support, followed by Andrew Yang (D) and Tom Steyer (D), who garnered two percent support each. The remaining candidates saw one percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.8 percent:

Yang -3 https://t.co/hEBkWCzAV2 — Political Polls (@PpollingNumbers) October 2, 2019

New Hampshire Institute of Politics Executive Director Neil Levesque highlighted the sense of “fluidity” in the race, due to the fact that “65% of Warren supporters, 72% of Biden supporters, 56% of Sanders supporters, and 73% of Buttigieg voters indicate that they expect that their choice could change between now and the primary election.”

Levesque added:

Among voters who are not firm in their choice, Warren is the 2nd choice of 26%, well ahead of Biden with 12%, Buttigieg with 11%, Sanders with 7% and Harris with 7%. This suggests that when the field begins to winnow down, Warren may in the best position to pick up other candidates’ support. However, if this turns into a two-person race, the nomination may ultimately turn on what sort of candidate Democrats want to send against Donald Trump: one that they believe would make the best president, or one that they believe has the best chance of beating him. If the former, Warren has a clear 27% to 19% advantage over Biden on the question of whom respondents think would make the best President. However, Biden is seen as the strongest nominee against Trump by 37% of voters compared to Warren with 26%. As in our April poll, Warren leads Biden among ‘extremely interested’ and ‘very liberal’ voters, at 28% – 24% and 35% – 11% respectively.

The poll spells trouble for Sanders, who has been slipping in New Hampshire, as recent polls indicate.

A Monmouth Poll released last Tuesday showed a similar trend, with Warren edging out Biden (27 percent to 25 percent) and leading Sanders – who garnered 12 percent support – by double digits:

Reports emerged of a staffer shakeup for the Sanders campaign last month. The Sanders campaign moved presidential campaign operations state director Joe Caiazzo from New Hampshire to Massachusetts and replaced him with Shannon Jackson, who served as a senior adviser during Sanders’ 2016 presidential bid and ran his Senate reelection campaign.

While the Sanders campaign continues to reconfigure and strategize on how to win over New Hampshire as it did in 2016, the campaign reported a monstrous $25.3 million received in the third quarter, signaling that his campaign is in it for the long haul."
8,"MJ Lee, CNN Political Correspondent",,"Elizabeth Warren and her husband, Bruce Mann, were sitting down together for their first joint interview of the 2020 campaign in their home in Cambridge.",2019-10-02,CNN,"Elizabeth Warren's husband explains how their dog, Bailey, sent him to the ER",https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/01/politics/elizabeth-warren-dog-bailey/index.html,"Cambridge, Massachusetts (CNN) Elizabeth Warren and her husband, Bruce Mann, were sitting down together for their first joint interview of the 2020 campaign in their home in Cambridge.

In the middle of the interview, Mann got stuck on a question: What was something he could share about his wife that the public didn't already know?

Suddenly, turning her attention towards the kitchen, Warren yelled out: ""Oooh!"" Bailey, the couple's 16-month-old golden retriever, had bounded into the sunroom, making a beeline for the senator and her husband.

""To the rescue! Bailey!"" Mann joked.

""Good boy,"" Warren said.

Hours earlier, Mann and Bailey had opened the side door of their Cambridge home, letting CNN reporters inside for the couple's first joint interview of the campaign. Mann's left hand was in a cast.

As Mann explained it, Bailey had recently been roaming off-leash in the neighborhood. He started playing with another dog, but soon ""the play stopped, and the other dog attacked him."" Mann got between the two dogs, and his hand caught on Bailey's harness, resulting in a broken finger.

Mann, a professor at Harvard Law School, headed over to campus to teach a class before taking himself to the emergency room.

Later, when Warren joined Mann for the joint interview, she wanted to set the record straight: ""Bailey got jumped.""

""Let's be clear. Bailey was jumped by another dog,"" she said. ""And Bruce went to Bailey's rescue.""

Sen. Elizabeth Warren's dog Bailey stands with her husband Bruce Mann as Warren addresses the media outside of her home after announcing she formed an exploratory committee for a 2020 Presidential run on December 31, 2018 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Both Warren and Mann have long been dog people. As Warren writes in her autobiography, ""A Fighting Chance,"" when she was teaching at the University of Pennsylvania years ago, a group of students surprised her with a golden retriever puppy on the last day of class.

In the course of their wide-ranging interview, Warren and Mann pointed to Bailey as one of the most important ways in which they have tried to keep a sense of calm this year as the Massachusetts senator has been running for President.

Their previous golden retriever, Otis, ""had gotten Elizabeth through"" her first Senate campaign in 2012, Mann said -- ""just by being this big fluffy golden.""

""Otis was the calm. You can do this. We'll get through this together,"" Warren said. ""I would often brush Otis while I'd be on a phone call.""

Otis died just days before Warren's Senate victory. It was a painful loss for the couple, and for years, they said, they couldn't fathom taking on everything that came with taking care of a dog again as Warren juggled her new job in Washington and Mann continued to teach at the law school.

But last summer, Mann saw an opening. One of their grandchildren was visiting, so he would be home in Cambridge for an extended period of time rather than commuting back and forth to Washington, DC. He seized the moment and brought Bailey home.

Now, as Warren runs for President, whenever she is home in Cambridge, the couple makes time to drive over to Fresh Pond with Bailey. A ""really good day,"" Warren said, is when they can do the loop around the pond twice in one day.

Getting Bailey last year ""probably made no sense at all,"" Warren said, but now, they ""can't imagine life without him.""

""And besides, there's really nothing better than a golden retriever puppy to create the illusion of normalcy,"" Mann said."

In a Facebook post responding to the leaked audio, Zuckerberg acknowledged the authenticity of the comments reported by The Verge.

It, along with a late-September Quinnipiac University poll , is the second recent national poll to show Warren and Biden topping the field and within the margin of error of each other, and the third to show Warren in the mid- to upper-20s in support.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has been hospitalized with serious heart problems, what had already been a bad week for former Vice President Joe Biden has just gotten even worse.

I’ll get to the why of that in a bit, but let’s first take a look at all the other bad news.

The Polls

As I have said since the beginning, the only polls I’m going to take seriously are post-Labor Day, after summer is over and people are actually paying attention to the race. It was and still is my belief that while enjoying the summer months, Democrat voters parked their votes on tried-and-true Uncle Joe but that this could change after people started to tune in.

Well, tuning in, they are, and Biden’s slide is very real and may not have yet reached bottom.

According to the Real Clear Politics poll of polls, Biden went from a double-digit national lead ten days ago to just a two-point lead today.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is climbing, is attracting the crowds, while Slow Joe falls and can hardly attract flies.

In the all-important early primary states, Biden is losing in Iowa, is only three points up in New Hampshire (Warren leads in the two most recent polls), and only two points up in Nevada. (Warren and Biden are tied in the latest poll.)

Biden’s firewall in South Carolina remains strong — he’s up by 22 points, but if he loses New Hampshire and Iowa, he will have to make history to win the Democrat nomination.

The Picture

Last month, Joe Biden told us, “I’ve never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.”

That is a flat-out lie.

This entire scandal revolves around Biden’s son Hunter, who made more than $50,000 a month — a month! — for sitting on the board of a Ukrainian oil company. The problem, of course, is that Hunter has no experience whatsoever in that field and that when Hunter scored that sweet gig, then-President Obama had put Joe Biden in charge of dealing with Ukraine.

What’s more, once a Ukrainian prosecutor began to look into Hunter’s company, Joe threatened to withhold crucial U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired — which he was.

Now, liars in the media, serial liars like Jake Tapper, are lying about this — saying the prosecutor was not looking into Hunter Biden’s company when Daddy Joe forced him out, but this very same prosecutor has signed an affidavit under penalty of perjury saying that he was.

Anyway, back to the lie…

To begin with, we know Daddy Joe spoke to Hunter about his shady, overseas business dealings because in an interview with the New Yorker, Hunter said they spoke about his shady, overseas business dealings.

But now, we have nothing less than photographic proof…

Look at this, y’all… An actual photograph of then-Vice President Joe Biden and his ne’er-do-well son out golfing with a board member of the company that hired No-Experience-Hunter.

That’s whatchoo call a clean bust.

The Pulmonary

While we all hope and pray Bernie Sanders makes a full and speedy recovery, the political reality of the matter is still the political reality of the matter.

While on the campaign trail, Bernie felt chest pains, was rushed to the hospital, and surgery was performed to implant two heart stents. Bernie is still in the hospital, his presidential campaign is suspended, as is his political advertising.

This is a serious and significant development, but not just for Bernie.

Bernie Sanders is 78-years-old.

Joe Biden will be 77 next month.

And let’s not forget that until today’s news, Bernie was by far the most robust and energetic of the two.

After all, it was Joe Biden’s eye that filled with blood on TV just a few weeks ago, and it was Joe Biden’s teeth that came loose during a national debate last month, and it has been Joe Biden taking it easy on the campaign trail, going on vacation, disappearing for days at a time, etc.

If Democrats are smart, they will remember the lesson of 2016 when an obviously frail, sickly, and weak Hillary Clinton collapsed into a van at that September 11 memorial event.

While I have always made fun of Bernie’s age, I have also always used him as an example of what a robust 78-year-old looks like, how it is possible to be virile and vibrant into your late seventies. In fact, I have used Bernie as an example to explain just how frail and old Joe Biden looks by comparison.

Nothing terrifies Democrats more than the idea of Trump’s second term, and Bernie’s health scare will probably serve as a reality check that will have them rethinking their support for these pushing-80 candidates. What they are imagining right now is what a catastrophe this would have been had Bernie won the general election.

Naturally, then, these thoughts are going to turn to Slow Joe and the fact that if this happened to Bernie, there is an even bigger chance it will happen to Joe, who was never as energetic or full of fire as Bernie.

This reality check could also hurt Warren, who is 70. If she wins the nomination, she will be 71 and the oldest presidential nominee (from either party) in history.

Sure, Warren seems spry and energetic but … so did Bernie.

Regardless, this has been a very bad week for Quid Pro Joe … and it is only Wednesday.

In public, Zuckerberg is all humility. Mark Zuckerberg: “I’m Really Sorry That This Happened” could be any headline about a Facebook data scandal in the past two years. His 2018 speech to European politicians was an apology. His remarks before Congress were an apology. After the Cambridge Analytica affair, Facebook took out full-page newspaper ads in ten newspapers, apologizing.

In private, however, the Facebook CEO sings a different tune, promising defiance against regulators and politicians, and joking about how he can’t be fired.

In leaked audio obtained by the Verge, Zuckerberg pledges to fight against any regulation of big tech pushed by Elizabeth Warren or any other politician.

That doesn’t mean that, even if there’s anger and that you have someone like Elizabeth Warren who thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies … I mean, if she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge….at the end of the day, if someone’s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.

He said it was particularly important that Facebook and other big tech companies aren’t broken up, because only they’re big enough to censor everyone — or stop “hate speech,” in the Facebook founder’s words.

You know, [breaking up big tech] doesn’t make election interference less likely. It makes it more likely because now the companies can’t coordinate and work together. It doesn’t make any of the hate speech or issues like that less likely. It makes it more likely because now … all the processes that we’re putting in place and investing in, now we’re more fragmented. [emphasis added]

He also mocked Twitter for not being big enough to censor as efficiently as Facebook.

It’s why Twitter can’t do as good of a job as we can. I mean, they face, qualitatively, the same types of issues. But they can’t put in the investment. Our investment on safety is bigger than the whole revenue of their company. [laughter]

Zuckerberg’s answer to global scrutiny from national governments? Just ignore them, if they’re not big enough to matter! (Fun fact, Facebook has revenues greater than the GDP of Serbia, and would be the 90th-wealthiest country in the world if it were a country).

I did hearings in the US. I did hearings in the EU. It just doesn’t really make sense for me to go to hearings in every single country that wants to have me show up and, frankly, doesn’t have jurisdiction to demand that.

Does the arrogance and the commitment to massive investments to fight “hate speech” concern you? Too bad — Zuckerberg isn’t going anywhere:

kind of have voting control of the company, and that’s something I focused on early on. And it was important because, without that, there were several points where I would’ve been fired. For sure, for sure…

In the early days of Facebook, reporters obtained a now-infamous message from Zuckerberg in which he mocked the platform’s users as “dumb f**cks” for trusting him with their personal data.

Insincere contrition in public, and cavalier arrogance in private. Not much has changed!

Bernie Sanders will launch his first television ad of the 2020 cycle in Iowa, the campaign announced Tuesday.

The $1.3 million buy was made public hours after Sanders revealed that he raised more than $25 million during the last three months , the biggest quarterly haul of any Democratic candidate to date.

Sanders has been slumping in recent early state polling. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden led in a recent CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey of likely Iowa caucusgoers; that same poll put Sanders at a distant third. But the campaign is now looking to leverage Sanders' massive and loyal small dollar donor base to hit the airwaves in an effort to turn the tide.

The ad was produced by Sanders' in-house production team, as CNN reported last week , and will appear in 30- and 60-second versions beginning on Thursday, according to a press release. It will run for the subsequent two weeks.

In a preview provided by the campaign, the spot -- titled ""Fight For Us"" -- begins with a biographical note.

""Living in a family that struggled economically powerfully influenced my life and my values,"" Sanders says in a clip taken from his campaign's first rally, in Brooklyn, New York , where he grew up.

The ad then flips through a series of images showing Sanders marching with wage workers demanding a union, rallying for his signature public policy proposal, ""Medicare for All,"" and being arrested, as a young man in early 1960s Chicago, during a civil rights protest.

""Now, our country is at a turning point,"" the narrator says as President Donald Trump and the white nationalist demonstrators from Charlottesville, Virginia, appear. ""A dangerous demagogue tearing our nation apart, hard-working people betrayed by Trump, a health care system that makes enormous profits for drug and insurance companies, and a planet on the brink of a climate disaster.""

The ad also touts Sanders' clashes with Wall Street, pharmaceutical companies -- including a clip from his July visit to Canada with diabetes patients in search of affordable insulin -- and his push to raise the minimum wage for employees at Amazon.

""In this moment, we need a fighter: Bernie Sanders,"" the minute-long version of the ad concludes. ""We know he'll fight for us as president, because he always has.""

The question of when the campaign would go on television in Iowa had rankled some top aides to the campaign, who were pushing for an earlier debut. The ad's release follows Sanders' recent ""Bernie Beats Trump"" tour of the state, which centered on counties where voters flipped from backing former President Barack Obama to President Donald Trump in 2016."

Kamala Harris raised $11.6 million in the third quarter of 2019, her campaign announced Tuesday, a sum that is consistent with her previous hauls, despite the California Democrat's falling poll numbers.

Harris' standing in the race, after rocketing up in the polls, has fallen in recent months, as the senator struggles to recapture the momentum that she gained during the first Democratic debate in June. Harris' campaign has also been beset by internal issues, with sources telling CNN earlier on Tuesday that the senator was reshaping the senior staff on her campaign in a bid to streamline an operation that one source said has been bogged down by bureaucratic hurdles.

Even still, Harris' fundraising has been notably consistent throughout her presidential run. The candidate raised $12 million in the first quarter and $11.8 million in the second quarter.

The haul puts Harris below some of the race's top fundraisers, like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who announced he raised over $25 million on Tuesday, or South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who announced he had raised over $19 million in the third quarter. But it puts the California Democrat far ahead of candidates like New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who also announced on Tuesday he had raised $6 million in the third quarter.

""This is a campaign that is growing, expanding, and built to win this primary,"" Juan Rodriguez, Harris campaign manager, said in a statement. ""As we have spent the summer months strengthening our infrastructure, we enter this final stretch of 2019 with ample resources to execute a winning game plan.""

While the haul is substantial -- and will likely land Buttigieg among the top tier of Democratic fundraisers -- it is down from the nearly $25 million the South Bend, Indiana, mayor raised in the second quarter of 2019.

Buttigieg has now raised more than $51 million since the start of 2019, a sizable number for a candidate who started the year with relatively little name recognition.

Buttigieg tweeted Tuesday morning saying he is ""profoundly grateful"" and ""together, we're building a movement that's big enough, and hopeful enough to do things differently and win.""

""This is great news and shows that in a crowded field, Pete continues to stand out as having the vision and leadership voters know we need to tackle the urgent problems facing our country,"" campaign manager Mike Schmuhl wrote in a memo released to reporters. ""We will have the resources to go the full distance, and to win, the 2020 nominating contests.""

Buttigieg received donations from roughly 182,000 new donors in the third quarter, his campaign said, bringing their total number of unique donors to more than 580,000. The average donation for the quarter was $32, Schmuhl wrote.

""While Q3 of an off-year is traditionally a notoriously challenging quarter to fundraise, our campaign continued to see strong performance,"" Schmuhl said, seeking to explain why the number was down from the second quarter. ""Throughout this time, we've been hyper-focused on scaling the organization and building the infrastructure needed to win the nomination.""

Schmuhl did not disclose the campaign's cash on hand in his memo.

Buttigieg did spend considerable time on the fundraising circuit over the last three months, headlining in-person fundraisers across the country. But the mayor's fundraising pace was intentionally down over the last three months as the candidate begins to spend more time and resources on building a campaign infrastructure and organizing in key early states.

Buttigieg's campaign grew quickly in the third quarter. The mayor's staff in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina grew from 107 people to 227 over the last three months, with the campaign's entire staff now topping out at nearly 400 people.

The biggest growth was in Iowa, where the candidate now has 21 offices and nearly 100 people on the ground. Buttigieg's New Hampshire staff nearly doubled, from 34 to 64 people. And Buttigieg's staff in Nevada went from six at the start of the third quarter to 35 people today.

That growth, however, has yet to be markedly seen in recent polling, where Buttigieg's standing has stagnated.

After using a CNN town hall and a series of media appearances to vault himself from the depths of low polling presidential campaigns, Buttigieg plateaued over the summer, hovering in the mid-single digits in most national polls. The mayor has seen some growth in early state polling, but he continues to trail former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, three well known Democrats who have positioned themselves as the race's top tier.

Schmuhl noted in his memo that Buttigieg ""did not come into this race having operated in Washington for years or decades,"" ""did not transfer millions of dollars from other accounts into this one,"" and has ""not been cultivating an email list for years,"" all things that are true about many of Buttigieg's opponents.

""But every single day our campaign continues to grow, and every single day we continue to build the support that we need to be one of the very few campaigns that will actually be able to compete in and win the Democratic primary,"" he concluded."

In a brief exchange in the capital Kiev on Wednesday, Poroshenko said he had no information and did not send one of his general prosecutors, Yuriy Lutsenko , to meet with Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.

Giuliani says he twice met with Lutsenko -- in New York in January 2019, then in Warsaw in February.

Giuliani previously told CNN that Lutsenko, who was prosecutor under Poroshenko and his successor Volodymyr Zelensky until August, shared information with him related to allegations that Biden thwarted an investigation into his son Hunter's business dealings with a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Biden or his son.

In an April interview with the Babel, a Ukrainian news outlet, Lutsenko confirmed Giuliani's account of their conversations.

The alleged investigation into Burisma and Biden was central to a July phone call in which Trump repeatedly asked Zelensky to look into the Biden family, while simultaneously withholding almost $400 million worth of military aid to Ukraine. Trump has denied his decision to delay the aid had anything to do with his desire for Ukraine to investigate Biden.

whistleblower complaint about that call has prompted an impeachment inquiry, focused on Trump and Giuliani's Ukraine dealings.

Asked whether he sent Lutsenko to meet Giuliani, Poroshenko said: ""I knew nothing about it.""

The former mayor of New York City has also repeatedly pushed a theory that the origins of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election can be traced back to Democrats' dealings in Ukraine. Giuliani told CNN he learned more about the Russian interference, as well as the Biden allegations, from Lutsenko.

But Lutsenko, whose hold on power was precarious following Ukraine's April presidential election, ultimately backed off some of his claims that Giuliani worked to amplify, including that his office was reopening its investigation into Burisma and Biden.

According to the whistleblower's complaint, Giuliani's interactions with Ukrainian officials prompted concern among US officials about the ""circumvention of national security decision-making processes.""

Giuliani told CNN he never heard about any of those concerns. ""If they were going to get upset about this, they should have gotten upset about it in January or February,"" he said.

On Wednesday, Poroshenko also denied ever speaking to Biden about his son's business interests in Ukraine. Nor, Poroshenko said, did he speak to former US President Barack Obama or Trump about any commercial or personal business dealings.

""We never, ever spoke about commercial activity but we spoke about the form of the prosecutor general office, created condition for the independence of that,"" Poroshenko said. ""And now, unfortunately, by the law adopted now by parliament, the independence of the prosecutor's office was completely ruined.""

Asked whether he had fired former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin -- Lutsenko's predecessor -- because ""he was investigating Burisma and Biden,"" Poroshenko said he did not want to get involved in US politics and said that all general prosecutors in his country should be completely independent.

Trump has repeatedly claimed Shokin was investigating Hunter Biden. For example, Trump alleged on September 21 that the media wanted to avoid talking about the ""Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son...""

But there is no evidence that Hunter Biden was himself ever under investigation."

Silicon Valley’s previous candidate of choice was Pete Buttigieg, but despite his popularity with liberal elites and NeverTrump neocons, the South Bend mayor failed to enthuse Democrat primary voters.

Now, progressives in tech appear to be warming to Elizabeth Warren, despite her vocal stance against companies like Facebook and Google.

Via CNBC:

This growing contingent of tech insiders looking to back Warren started to take shape in the second quarter when she raised at least $19 million. At that time, she saw two contributions from Chamath Palihapitiya, a Silicon Valley-based venture capitalist, a $2,800 donation from investor and former “Shark Tank” star Chris Sacca and a $2,500 contribution from John MacFarlane, the founder of audio company Sonos Inc. Warren has yet to announce how much she raised in the third quarter.

CNBC reports that business leaders are exhausted by political disruption, and want a period of stability — even if it means higher taxes and more regulation.

Business leaders are clamoring for clarity on policy, even more than the policies themselves, as the 2020 election gets closer, said Aquila. “What business is looking for is a period of stability and calm,” Aquila said. “It’s less a partisan issue and more about bringing economic conditions that allow businesses to focus on business instead of wondering about the political world every two minutes. Many CFOs have told me over the years, ‘I can deal with higher tax rates or lower tax rates. I just need to know what the tax rate will be.’”

Although Warren has attracted a reputation for her anti-big tech positions, she is less consistent on the matter than her populist primary opponent Tulsi Gabbard.

Whereas Gabbard has been consistent on the question of censorship, criticizing big tech companies for “throwing free speech out the window,” Warren has flip-flopped on the issue.

A longtime Republican foreign policy expert who was seen in the White House as not fully ""on the Trump train,"" Volker is now at the center of the impeachment inquiry examining allegations Trump deployed the machinery of state in a vendetta to target political rivals.

Volker's testimony, analysts say, could be damaging to the President and his allies.

Volker is seen as ""a well-respected straight shooter who is likely to testify in ways that will damage other Trump allies,"" Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, wrote in an emailed analysis. ""It's possible others, including key administration members like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General William Barr would also be forced out.""

Volker is also one of the State Department witnesses whose depositions to Congress Secretary of State Michael Pompeo tried to block, setting off a tussle with lawmakers who say they will interpret any effort to prevent the officials' appearances as obstruction.

Where will Volker appear and why?

Volker is now set to testify before the Intelligence, Oversight and Reform and Foreign Affairs committees behind closed doors.

Dozens of pages of documents were delivered to those House committees Wednesday on behalf of Volker ahead of his Thursday deposition, two sources familiar tell CNN.

What remains unclear is if the documents were cleared by the State Department to be handed over, or if they are considered Volker's personal documents. The State Department did not respond to CNN's request for comment.

The announcement about his appearance came just hours before Volker resigned from his State Department position Friday, following release of the whistleblower complaint and a White House transcript of Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

In that call, Zelensky made clear that Ukraine, vulnerable and weak in the face of Russian aggression, wanted to buy American anti-tank missiles. Trump answered: ""I would like you to do us a favor though.""

Trump pushed Zelensky to work with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Barr to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, who had business dealings in Ukraine. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.

Trump also urged Zelensky to find a Democratic National Committee computer server that the US intelligence community says was hacked by Russian intelligence during the 2016 election campaign. There is no evidence Ukraine had any involvement in the hack.

The whistleblower complaint said that a day after Trump's call, Volker and the US ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, met with Zelensky and provided advice about how to ""navigate"" Trump's demands.

The State Department said this summer that Volker put Ukrainian Presidential Adviser Andriy Yermak in contact with Giuliani, at Yermak's request.

A source familiar with Volker's thinking said he was trying to get the Biden-Giuliani issue off the table, given that it was a political effort and not one that he was meant to support in his State Department role.

Volker did not want the controversy to occupy the center of bilateral conversations either, the source said, and hoped that in connecting Giuliani with Yermak, it would lead to a conversation in which the Ukrainians would agree to look into the matter and it would eventually fizzle out in two or three years.

Giuliani, meanwhile, has repeatedly claimed that these meetings were arranged at the State Department's request, pointing to Volker as the official who reached out to arrange them and showing text exchanges on television to back up that claim.

In one of the texts Giuliani released, Volker is quoted as suggesting a phone call with Yermak and Giuliani. It is unclear just how involved Volker was with Giuliani's political efforts.

Giuliani's campaign

But Giuliani has directly pursued Ukrainian investigations into American politics and Trump's leading political rival Biden at least since the spring.

The former New York mayor has pushed for a probe into the call Biden made in 2016 -- alongside the European Union, International Monetary Fund and others -- for the removal of Ukraine's top prosecutor, who at one point had been investigating a Ukrainian natural gas company that had Biden's son, Hunter, as a board member.

The prosecutor wasn't seen as tackling corruption aggressively, a key requirement for Ukraine to be considered for membership in the European Union.

In May, Giuliani floated traveling to Ukraine to meet with Zelensky in an effort to push the country to investigate Biden, as well as matters connected to the release of negative information about Paul Manafort, the former chairman for Trump's 2016 campaign. He ultimately reversed course and decided not to go.

In August, Giuliani said he had spoken to Yermak several times over the phone and met him in Madrid.

On Wednesday, the State Department inspector general provided Congress with dozens of pages of documents that included materials Giuliani had given the department earlier this year. Those documents, which were obtained by CNN, included the unsubstantiated claims about Biden and his son that formed the basis of Trump's accusations in his July call with Zelensky.

The whistleblower said in the complaint that in his understanding, Volker was trying to ""contain the damage"" inflicted on US policy by Giuliani and help Ukrainian officials ""navigate"" Trump's requests.

If Volker knows details of Giuliani's efforts, lawmakers will likely probe to learn as much as they can.

Who is Volker?

Volker is the executive director of the McCain Institute, which focuses on leadership, and kept that position even after being tapped in July 2017 by former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to become special envoy to Ukraine.

He has served as an ambassador to NATO, a European and Eurasian affairs expert at the National Security Council, and a deputy assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia. He got his start at the CIA as an analyst.

As representative, Volker has been at the heart of efforts to keep US military and economic aid flowing to Ukraine. He had also been the US point-man in trying to get dialogue started between Russia and Ukraine over the separatist revolt in eastern Ukraine, now in its sixth year.

In Kiev, Volker was seen as a reliable advocate. Yermak told CNN Saturday that Volker's ""consistent and comprehensive support for Ukraine throughout his tenure means a lot for our country.""

But almost a week later, Pompeo and the State Department have said nothing on the record about Volker's resignation.

'The Trump train'

Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko tweeted that ""one could hardly overestimate"" Volker's contribution to strengthening of our strategic partnership"" with the US.

But Volker, who worked as a special representative on a part-time, volunteer basis, didn't have a close relationship with the White House. Volker was not on the July 25th call with Trump and during his tenure, never had a one-on-one meeting with the President, a source close to the former special representative said.

A White House source has told CNN that Volker, an ally and protegee of prominent Republican Trump critic Sen. John McCain, never became a member of the President's inner circle. And according to another source, after Volker's resignation, there was little love lost for him inside the White House, where he was seen as ""never fully on the Trump train.""

In a letter to trustees of the McCain Institute on Saturday, Volker wrote that Congress had requested his testimony and he would ""be complying with that request."""

Here's the latest:

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: 'I was on the phone call' with Trump and Ukrainian President

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo admitted Wednesday that he was on the July 25 phone call in which President Donald Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.

""I was on the phone call,"" Pompeo said Wednesday during a news conference in Rome with Italy's foreign minister.

Some key context: A whistleblower complaint released last week alleges Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the 2020 election and that the White House took steps to cover it up. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

A rough transcript released by the White House shows Trump repeatedly pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, Trump's potential 2020 political rival, and his son Hunter Biden.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.

State Department inspector general requests urgent briefing on Ukraine with congressional staff

The State Department's inspector general on Tuesday requested an urgent briefing with senior congressional staff members after Pompeo pushed back on House Democratic demands to turn over documents related to Ukraine and to depose current and former State officials, according to sources briefed on the matter.

It remains unclear exactly what State Department Inspector General Steve Linick plans to provide Congress during the private briefing Wednesday.

Deposition for House impeachment investigation delayed

The aide said on Tuesday the testimony of former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, which had been scheduled for Wednesday, would now occur Oct. 11, following an agreement between the committee's and the former ambassador's counsel.

Three committees -- the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight panels -- have scheduled the depositions as part of their probe into whether Trump solicited help from a foreign government to dig up dirt on his political opponent.

Yovanovitch and Volker were two of the five depositions that the committees have scheduled during the next two weeks while Congress is on recess.

Giuliani hires a Watergate prosecutor as his attorney in impeachment inquiry

Florida attorney Jon Sale , who worked as an assistant prosecutor on the legal team investigating the Watergate scandal, is representing Giuliani in the matter of the congressional impeachment inquiry, both of them confirmed to CNN on Tuesday.

Giuliani was subpoenaed on Monday by the three committees in the House of Representatives investigating Trump's interactions with the Ukrainian government. The subpoena requests documents and correspondence from Giuliani related to Ukraine.

As a reminder, the whistleblower complaint labels Giuliani as ""central figure"" in the controversy. US officials were concerned, the whistleblower said, with Giuliani and his contacts with Ukrainian officials.

Key GOP senator breaks with Trump in saying the whistleblower 'ought to be heard out and protected'

Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chamber's most senior Republican and a longtime defender of whistleblowers, rebuked Trump on Tuesday when he said the whistleblower at the center of the impeachment inquiry ""appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected.""

His comments mark a clear departure from Trump and his allies, who in recent days have repeatedly maligned the whistleblower's motives and pushed to reveal the individual's identity.

Ukraine's President says he never met with Giuliani

""I never met Rudy Giuliani -- never. And never had any phone calls with him,"" Zelensky said Tuesday at a news conference in Kiev.

According to the White House transcript of the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky, the Ukrainian President said he was aware of Giuliani's efforts to uncover information that would help Trump politically, and Trump encouraged Zelensky to speak with his lawyer because Giuliani ""very much knows what's happening.""

Pompeo accuses House Democrats of intimidation and bullying over Ukraine controversy

""I'm concerned with aspects of the Committee's request that can be understood only as an attempt to intimidate, bully, & treat improperly the distinguished professionals of the Department of State, including several career FSOs,"" he tweeted.

The comments prompted House Democrats to issue a stark warning to the top US diplomat. The chairmen of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees told Pompeo that any effort to prevent those officials from speaking to Congress ""is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry.""

CNN reported Monday that Pompeo was on Trump's July call with Zelensky despite previously denying knowledge of the whistleblower complaint.

More news around Washington

How Lindsey Graham's support for Trump -- a man he once called a 'jackass' -- has evolved

Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is one of Trump's most vociferous defenders on Capitol Hill, but it wasn't always like that. In fact, Graham called Trump ""crazy and a ""jackass"" four years ago when he was running in the GOP presidential primary.

At the time, Trump wasn't so kind to Graham either, calling him a ""nut job.""

""This guy Lindsey Graham, he's one of the dumbest human beings I have ever seen,"" Trump said at a rally in South Carolina. ""He starts hitting me, saying vicious things, ends up with 0%. He left in disgrace.""

Don't assume the Senate would *never* impeach Trump

With the House headed down a path that virtually guarantees Trump will be impeached, conventional wisdom has settled on the idea that the Republican-led Senate will never, ever, remove him from office.

And, well, it's true that the strong likelihood is that the Senate acquits Trump, CNN's Chris Cillizza writes.

But if the Trump presidency -- and the way in which he became President -- teaches us anything, it should be this: Never assume. Anything.

Fact-checking Trump's false claim that the US is the only country providing aid to Ukraine

Trump has offered several explanations to justify his decision to delay military aid to Ukraine, first suggesting he was worried about ""corruption,"" then claiming the delay was a mechanism to pressure other countries to contribute.

On September 23, Trump voiced his complaint to reporters alongside Polish President Andrzej Duda, asking, ""Why is it always the United States spending money?"" and ""I don't like it that it's only us.""

Facts First: The US is not ""the only one"" contributing aid to Ukraine. Germany and France have both sent millions of euros to Ukraine, along with other European nations.

Connected by subpoenas: Giuliani and his Ukrainian middleman Lev Parnas face increased scrutiny

Parnas, a Ukrainian American businessman who has been subpoenaed as part of the House impeachment inquiry, has spent thousands of dollars on Trump properties and donated to the main super PAC supporting the President's reelection effort, according to documents produced in an unrelated federal lawsuit.

Starting in November 2018, Parnas introduced Giuliani to former and current Ukrainian officials, according to Giuliani.

Financial records uncovered as a result of a lawsuit filed in federal court in Florida earlier this year show Parnas spent thousands of dollars at Trump hotels in the fall of 2018, donated hundreds of thousands to the pro-Trump super PAC and received checks from Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm with deep connections to the Trump White House.

The financial ties between Trump's world and Parnas raise new questions about the nature of Parnas' relationship with Giuliani and who was paying the former New York mayor and Parnas for their research on Ukraine."

Ocasio-Cortez unveiled her “six-piece suite” last week, which includes legislation that would update the national poverty guidelines, give renters facing eviction access to a “counsel fund,” expand the “social safety net” to former convicts who “duly paid their debt to society,” and extend federal public benefits to illegal immigrants:

As Breitbart News detailed:

The Recognizing Poverty Act would, according to Ocasio-Cortez, “update the national poverty guidelines in order for us to acknowledge modern life.” That includes childcare and “new necessities” like Internet access. The Place to Prosper Act gives access to a “counsel fund” for renters who are facing eviction and “imposes a national cap of 3% on annual rent increases and begins to pursue penalties” on what the freshman lawmaker calls “abusive and predatory landlords.” Additionally, the Mercy in Re-Entry act extends the “social safety net” to former convicts who “duly paid their debt to society,” while the Embrace Act expands entitlement benefits to illegal immigrants. The Uplift Our Workers Act directs the federal government to “prefer doing business with worker-friendly contractors” based on a “worker-friendly score,” which Ocasio-Cortez likens to LEED certification. She also urges Congress to ratify the U.N. Covenant on Economic, Social, & Cultural Rights, which recognizes the right to “take part in cultural life” as well as the right to “enjoy the benefits of scientific progress.” It also recognizes the right to “an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions.”"

In recently leaked audio from The Verge, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg can be heard discussing a number of topics including how the Masters of the Universe will fight regulation or being broken up. Zuckerberg, when asked a question about what he would do if Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren became president and attempted to break up the company, answered that Facebook would “go to the mat and fight” the U.S. government in a court of law.

The comments come from two separate Q&A sessions Zuckerberg had with Facebook employees in July. Zuckerberg is quoted as saying: “You have someone like Elizabeth Warren that thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies … I mean, if she gets elected president then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.”

Zuckerberg adds: “And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don’t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. I mean, that’s not the position that you want to be in when you’re, you know, I mean … It’s like, we care about our country, and want to work with our government and do good things. But look, at the end of the day, if someone’s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and fight.”

Zuckerberg further stated in the recordings that Facebook’s size has helped it to fight election interference while rivals such as Twitter have failed in their efforts at times due to their lack of resources. “It’s why Twitter can’t do as good of a job as we can,” Zuckerberg said. “I mean, they face, qualitatively, the same types of issues. But they can’t put in the investment. Our investment on safety is bigger than the whole revenue of their company.”

Elizabeth Warren responded to Zuckerberg’s comments via Twitter, stating that a system that allows “giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices” must be fixed.

What would really “suck” is if we don’t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy. https://t.co/rI0v55KKAi — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 1, 2019

Discussing his refusal to appear before government bodies worried about privacy issues, Zuckerberg stated: “I’m not going to go to every single hearing around the world. A lot of different people want to do that. When the issues came up last year around Cambridge Analytica, I did hearings in the US. I did hearings in the EU. It just doesn’t really make sense for me to go to hearings in every single country that wants to have me show up.”

In July, Facebook was fined $5 billion by the FTC over privacy violations and the firms handling of the Cambridge Analytica data breach scandal. Many were not happy with the settlement with Sens. Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) stating that a $5 billion fine would be a “bargain” for the $600 billion company. The senators wrote to the FTC:

Even a fine in the billions is simply a write-down for the company, and large penalties have done little to deter large tech firms. If the FTC is seen as traffic police handing out speeding tickets companies profiting off breaking the law, then Facebook and other will continue to push the boundaries.

Zuckerberg posted a statement in response to the leak:

Here's how it played out,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/01/politics/cory-booker-risks-campaign-on-fundraising-push/index.html,"(CNN) As the clock ticked toward midnight at a divey pizza joint in Des Moines last month, two of Cory Booker 's top campaign aides didn't know whether it was the beginning of the end, or a new beginning.

The next day, their candidate and 16 others would take the stage at the Polk County Steak Fry, a major event on the Democratic calendar in Iowa for White House hopefuls. But they were about to raise the stakes even further.

Over greasy slices and novelty tiki cocktails, Booker senior adviser Matt Klapper and deputy campaign manager Jenna Lowenstein laid out for Jennifer Palmieri the campaign's audacious gambit: In the morning, they would announce a push to raise $1.7 million in 10 days; and, if they missed their target, Booker would drop out of the race

By Monday, it was clear that going all in had paid off. After hitting $1.7 million Sunday evening, more than one day ahead of their deadline, the campaign surged past $2 million by the end of the quarter Monday night.

It wouldn't be the end of Booker's challenges, financial or otherwise; his polling has stalled in the low single digits, and he has not yet met the polling threshold to qualify for the November debate.

But the fundraising sprint helped lift Booker's campaign to its best quarter of the cycle, his campaign announced Tuesday, with a total haul of $6 million.

""I'm staying in this race,"" Booker said in a statement Monday morning, ""and I'm in it to win.""

Palmieri, a veteran of Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign and the Obama White House, had admittedly been skeptical of the plan.

""I told them I thought it was risky because, I said, I'm not sure that you want to be the one that invites the notion of dropping out into your campaign,"" Palmieri, who isn't connected to a particular campaign this cycle, recounted. But Booker's team had already considered this and other possible pitfalls and concluded they had no other choice.

""They had much more serious money problems than people knew.""

Booker's campaign says it was not on the brink of insolvency. On their path prior to their 10-day bet, the campaign insisted, they could have sustained until the Iowa caucuses. But their fundraising had taken a significant hit during the crucial third quarter before the primary season, when they needed to be preparing to scale up — not retrenching. That is, if they wanted a shot to win.

This is the story of Booker's surprising gamble to save his presidential campaign, based on interviews with half a dozen aides, as well as outside supporters and other Democrats. Those inside the campaign spoke with CNN on condition of anonymity to freely discuss internal strategy and deliberations.

""We forced the crisis,"" one senior campaign aide explained, ""because the crisis in its truest form was going to come too late.""

An idea is born

Presidential candidate and U.S. Sen. Cory Booker attends the Democratic Polk County Steak Fry on September 21, 2019 in Des Moines, Iowa. Seventeen presidential candidates attended the Polk County Steak Fry.

The campaign started to see red flags in September, when an anticipated fundraising surge never materialized. After the third Democratic debate in Houston, ""the trajectory of the budget changed very fast,"" according to one senior aide.

At a sushi lunch the following week, Lowenstein brainstormed how to course correct with Emily Norman, the campaign's chief innovation officer; and two members of the campaign's digital team, Alex Witt and Catherine Gabel.

It was Norman who suggested going public with the campaign's fundraising shortfall.

""Let's be honest with people,"" she said, reasoning that voters liked Booker and would want him as an option in the early primary states, even if they weren't ready to commit to him yet. Norman guessed that many Democrats assumed Booker had enough money to remain competitive, and would lend their support to the campaign if they understood the starker reality.

It sounded crazy — but then, they shrugged, wasn't this primary already sort of weird? Toward the end of a small senior staff meeting that week with campaign manager Addisu Demissie and Klapper, Lowenstein threw out the idea.

They each argued for it and argued against it; then they marinated on it. Ultimately, when they brought a menu of options to Booker, they recommended the highly unorthodox scheme.

""All of us were at a point where we were just open and looking for things to shake up what has been a very stagnant race,"" one senior aide said. They believed, and Booker agreed, that this course of ""radical transparency"" would reflect the values of the campaign — and, maybe, it could work.

Once Booker greenlit the plan, his campaign had roughly 48 hours to orchestrate a rollout and plot the 10-day push to come. For their fundraising target, they settled on a number that was ambitious but, under near-perfect conditions, attainable: $1.7 million, more money than Booker had raised during any 10-day period since he entered the race.

Booker ""was completely sober about the challenge, and totally ready to run at it,"" one senior aide said. But as staff began to learn of the campaign's financial state and the challenge ahead, ""there was a mix of shock and a little bit of, 'shit,'"" another aide recalled.

""We knew we needed to do it,"" another senior aide said. ""We didn't know if we could do it.""

On September 20, the evening before the Steak Fry, as Booker was campaigning in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, they began to inform donors and supporters of their plans. Outside of an LGBTQ forum, Klapper paced back and forth furiously, his ear to his phone.

Cedar Rapids Councilman Dale Todd, who has endorsed Booker, saw the candidate and his team that evening and learned the news firsthand. Booker was ebullient as ever, Todd recalled. For his part, Todd said he never questioned their strategy nor thought of jumping ship.

""I would rather have a great candidate with no money than a lousy candidate with a lot of money,"" Todd said. ""We can beat the money hands down.""

As Booker and his team drove to Des Moines that night, with Klapper, Lowenstein and Iowa state director Mike Frosolone in the car, Booker called to share the plan with his Iowa staff, who had spent long days preparing for the Steak Fry and now would be executing under very different circumstances.

It wasn't clear how they would respond.

""You're telling people who have poured their lives into something that there is a chance that it could end,"" one senior aide said. ""But it was laced with a sense of purpose and optimism, that it was in our hands.""

The rest of Booker's staff learned about the pivotal 10 days ahead when NBC News broke the story the following morning, and Demissie emailed his team to confirm it. Booker joined an all-staff call to rally his troops, saying he could ""see victory.""

""He talked about envisioning caucus day in Iowa and New Hampshire primary day,"" a senior aide said, ""and this was just part of the story.""

Immediately, Sand filmed a short selfie video in which he praised Booker's ""unique voice"" in the primary, saying he stood out as ""the strongest uniter."" Sand wasn't endorsing Booker, he noted, still wearing his hunting camo, ""but I do know that I want him in the race.""

Sand was one of the first elected officials and influential Democrats to speak out in support of Booker, but he wouldn't be the last. That first day and in the days to come, Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington, DC, and others would encourage their supporters to donate to Booker, though none went so far as to endorse him.

The overwhelming response befuddled and frustrated some of Booker's rivals.

""When the only tactic to bring in significant fundraising is a threat to drop out, that's cause for alarm, not celebration,"" said one aide to another Democratic presidential campaign. ""Hey, I gotta give them credit for taking a big gamble that paid off. I respect the hustle. But the bigger question is: why did a lot of establishment Democrats unify around him to help him cross that bridge?""

The rival aide added: ""That's $1.7 million sucked out of the pool and poured into a campaign that, by their own admission, was going nowhere. At a time when most people want to winnow the field, it just struck me as odd that there was a broad effort to prop up a campaign that said they were failing.""

But where some people saw a failing campaign, others saw one that simply hadn't taken off yet.

The flood of support for Booker from Democrats was ""a reaffirmation of what the polls show,"" said Sand, ""which is, he might not be polling as everyone as people's number one choice, but he's definitely someone that a lot of people consider and a lot of people like as a candidate.""

""He obviously would be on my shortlist for someone I'd be interested in endorsing,"" Sand added.

Booker's team had been apprehensive about how their announcement would be received. Would people assume the campaign was dead, rather than rally to save it? As the first day unfolded, however, it became clear that Democrats were answering their call.

When a senior Booker aide saw the personal donation and appeal from Gillibrand, a former 2020 rival, ""that was a moment when I was like, oh, people are gonna show up for this.""

Booker's network was not only holding together, but energized. The mood ""was positive and action-oriented"" on a call that afternoon with key donors and supporters, led by Demissie, Klapper and national finance director Lauren Dikis.

""It felt much more like a team huddle,"" said a source who listened to the call, ""like, let's go out and here's the play.""

Back at the Steak Fry, it seemed like a relatively normal day on the campaign trail. Booker had planned to mention the fundraising goal in his remarks; but, surprising no one on his team, he got so whipped up in the moment that he skipped right over it.

The message got out anyway. By the end of the first day, Booker's team had posted their best grassroots fundraising haul of the campaign. In 24 hours, they would raise more than $300,000. And the senior team began to think that their impossible mission might be possible, after all.

Lowenstein would fly back from Iowa with $4,000-worth of contributions in her purse. In Newark, Demissie added September 21 to his list of memorable days in more than a decade of working on presidential campaigns. But their work was still far from over.

""We just put a boat in the water and it didn't sink,"" Booker told Demissie when they spoke that evening. ""Now we have to row it to the other side.""

Do-or-die

As Booker's team settled into a rhythm, senior aides were gratified to see the campaign's staff rallying around their shared goal. But they were a little uncomfortable with the tattoos.

It had all started after the Steak Fry, when one Iowa organizer asked Booker to write the campaign's motto, ""we rise,"" so that she could have it tattooed on her arm in his handwriting.

Suddenly, more than a dozen Iowa organizers were pledging to ink ""we rise"" if they hit their fundraising goals. One set his sights on a ""baby bonds"" tattoo, after Booker's signature policy proposal to shrink the racial wealth gap. Before long, Frosolone, the state director, had also committed to a ""we rise"" tattoo if his team could bring in $30,000 toward the campaign's goal.

""To be clear, we did not encourage this,"" one aide said. ""This is as grassroots as it gets.""

After the initial burst of adrenaline from Booker's do-or-die moment, there was no guarantee that his team would be able to sustain the momentum they needed to reach $1.7 million. But no one seemed to think they were living through the final days of the campaign.

Campaign aides continued to operate as though they would meet their fundraising goal. Events remained on the schedule for after September 30, and plans were already underway to begin scaling up in Iowa and elsewhere.

Meanwhile, Booker did not withdraw from the campaign trail to focus solely on fundraising, instead choosing to keep up a full schedule of travel and events. During the 10-day push, he would hit all three early primary states: Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.

During a stop Thursday at Politics and Eggs in New Hampshire, a must-do stop for candidates, Booker received an enthusiastic response. ""Welcome to the Cory Booker rally,"" Jim Brett, president of the New England council, joked after the crowd gave Booker a standing ovation — an unusual show of support at what is normally a staid event. Afterward, Booker's New Hampshire adviser Jim Demers collected checks for $500 and $1,000 from two people he had never met.

""Nobody ever goes to that event and leaves with campaign contributions,"" Demers said.

Later that evening, Booker was running through the halls of CNN in New York, ducking behind corners to outrun his campaign aide who was staffing him for an interview with Don Lemon. In the car afterward, the candidate was cracking jokes. And when Booker finally arrived home around 11:30 p.m., he was ""still so f*****g cheery and so upbeat,"" an aide recalled.

If this was a dire chapter in the story of Booker's campaign, it sure didn't look like it.

To keep staff motivated throughout the week, senior aides organized calls each night to field questions and give updates on progress. In the final stretch, the calls also featured surprise pep talks from Booker's girlfriend Rosario Dawson, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and Democratic campaign veteran Marlon Marshall.

When staff logged on Sunday afternoon for their final call before their 10-day deadline, Hillary Clinton's voice came through their AirPods and speakers.

According to a source on the call, Clinton recalled her experiences working on presidential campaigns, including for Jimmy Carter. She expressed her gratitude for Booker's help in 2016, when he was an active surrogate for her presidential campaign. And she cheered on his staff in their own hour of need.

""The best way you can push through this and the challenges ahead is by sticking together,"" Clinton said.

Next steps

Democratic presidential candidate and Sen. Cory Booker addresses a crowd during a campaign trail block party on September 29, 2019 in Columbia, South Carolina.

By Monday, Lowenstein's fateful sushi lunch had already become the stuff of legend within the Booker campaign.

""The story will one day be told: at a lunch, a number of the great leaders, great women on our campaign, thought up this incredible idea to just open up the curtain and show people behind the scenes of what we needed to thrive and survive,"" Booker said during a call Monday evening with his staff.

The campaign had just shot past the $2 million mark, five hours before the end of the third quarter, and Booker praised his team's ""grit"" over the past 10 days. But he also acknowledged the challenges ahead, likening his team to Washington's army in the Revolutionary War, ""outgunned and outmatched"" by rivals with more money.

""This is going to be a hard quarter,"" Booker said. ""It's also going to be a defining quarter.""

Booker's dramatic, desperate fundraising gambit worked this time. But whether his campaign can sustain the fundraising pace it will need to grow is an open question — and the money he raised this week is no panacea, his campaign says.

""To be clear, $1.7 million doesn't get us to where we need to be,"" one senior aide said. ""It just puts us back on a track, and now we'll need to stay on that track.""

Among the field of Democratic presidential hopefuls, Booker has never been a standout fundraiser. In the second quarter this year, he raised just $4.5 million — a fraction of the hauls posted by frontrunners Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden. Booker's team believes there are four campaigns in the top tier of fundraising -- and they are not one of them.

To continue growing, Booker's team has set a $3 million fundraising goal for October. And they hope to begin to address a core issue that has hobbled their fundraising to date: Prior to running for president, Booker did not cultivate a list of grassroots donors, as many other candidates did.

With the fresh infusion of cash, Booker's campaign is now planning a six-figure investment in its email list, Demissie said Tuesday.

Another factor is outside of Booker's control, however.

""Why does Cory Booker have money problems?"" Palmieri said. ""Because of the debate rules.""

Booker, like other second- and third-tier candidates, has needed to expend considerable resources to meet the Democratic National Committee's donor thresholds for the debates.

""If we had one hundred dollars to spend and we wanted to spend ten of it on persuasion, but we weren't that arbitrary donor threshold yet, we had to spend it on the donor,"" one senior campaign aide said.

The DNC recently announced that candidates would need 165,000 unique donors to qualify for the November debate. Booker's campaign only crossed that threshold this past week, during their fundraising push. And it's possible that that number will go up again.

It's only one of the challenges Booker will need to meet in the coming weeks, as he looks to build support for his underdog campaign. As Booker might say, keeping his campaign alive was just the floor, not the ceiling.

""We'll run through this brick wall, and then Lord knows how many brick walls are going to be on the other side,"" another senior aide said. ""But that, my friend, is a presidential campaign."""

In addition to Buttigieg, Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) 2020 campaign also released its third-quarter haul, taking in over $25 million in the same time period.

The Sanders campaign released its campaign total earlier than the bulk of the field, boasting of a massive $25.3 million raised in the third quarter alone — $7.3 million more than the $18 million his campaign raised in the second quarter. It is the “largest three-month sum a Democratic White House hopeful has posted all year,” according to the Associated Press (AP).

The campaign has stressed the importance of small, grassroots donations and reported that the $25.3 million haul came from 1.4 million individual donations, with an average donation of $18.07.

“Media elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign, and yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution,” Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said, according to the AP.

His report surpasses Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) second-quarter report of $19.1 million raised, all of which stemmed from grassroots donors. Her third-quarter totals have yet to be released.

Only Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) — who has remained in the second tier of Democrat candidates — released fundraising totals alongside Sanders. His campaign reported $19.1 million raised, over $5 million less than his second-quarter total.

Sanders has raised $61.5 million since the launch of his presidential bid this year and has remained in the top tier of candidates, battling Warren and Joe Biden (D) for first place.

Hunter Biden served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma as his father was leading the Obama administration’s diplomatic dealings with Kiev. Trump has claimed that Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to shut down a corruption investigation of Burisma. The former vice president has denied doing anything wrong.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced last week — without the usual protocol of the House voting on an impeachment resolution — that an impeachment inquiry is underway.

Democrats claim Trump abused his power by mentioning the longstanding Joe/Hunter Biden Ukraine controversy and efforts to investigate it on a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Trump has described the call as “perfect,” and in keeping with conversations between world leaders about fighting government corruption.

Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) campaign has canceled its plans for a $1.3 million ad buy in Iowa following reports of the presidential candidate undergoing emergency heart surgery to treat an arterial blockage.

The Sanders campaign has reportedly canceled its ad blitz in the coveted early caucus state, according to recent reports:

As of Tuesday, the Sanders campaign planned on spending $1.3 million on an ad blast in Iowa, directly taking aim at President Trump. It was slated to drop on Thursday.

“Whether it was Wall Street, the drug companies or other powerful special interests, Bernie has taken them on for us,” the narrator in the ad states. “Now, our country is at a turning point.”

“A dangerous demagogue tearing our nation apart, hard-working people betrayed by Trump, a health care system that makes enormous profits for drug and insurance companies, and a planet on the brink of a climate disaster,” it continues.

“In this moment, we need a fighter,” it adds. “Bernie Sanders”:

The exact reason for the cancelation remains largely speculative. While it could signal a drastic shift in strategy, the news coincided with the campaign’s announcement of Sanders’ emergency heart surgery. Doctors inserted two stents to treat an arterial blockage after Sanders experienced chest pain at a Tuesday campaign event.

Sanders’ Senior Advisor Jeff Weaver said the presidential candidate is in “good spirits” and will be resting up over the next few days. Because of that, all future campaign events and appearances are canceled “until further notice.”

The current Real Clear Politics average shows Sanders in third place in the Hawkeye State, with 12 percent support. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) leads with 23 percent, followed by Joe Biden (D) with 20.3 percent."

Wouldn’t anyone so positioned against a defendant be barred from serving as a judge or jury in a court of law? — Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) October 2, 2019

He added, “Wouldn’t anyone so positioned against a defendant be barred from serving as a judge or jury in a court of law?” Several leading Democrat presidential candidates and senators have come out in favor of impeaching President Trump, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Amy Klobucar (D-MN) have all come in favor of impeachment.

The congressman’s contention might suggest that the Democrat senators might have a conflict of interest in that their support for impeaching President Trump might further their chances for becoming president of the United States. Rep. Massie’s tweet arises as House Oversight Republicans have continued to rail against House Democrats’ efforts to target State Department officials regarding their impeachment inquiry into President Trump. House Oversight and Reform Committee ranking member Jim Jordan (R-OH) said Tuesday that Democrats have continued to engage in “abusive targeting” of State Department officials. In response to the Democrat depositions as well as Secretary Pompeo’s letter, House Oversight ranking member Jim Jordan (R-OH) said that the House Oversight Republicans have “serious concerns” about Democrats’ “abusive targeting” of State Department officials. The Ohio conservative said that the Democrats’ depositions will put the nation’s national security at risk. “We have serious concerns about Democrats’ abusive targeting of our career foreign service professionals, which would put our nation’s diplomatic interests at risk,” Congressman Jordan said. “The Democrats are choosing confrontation over cooperation and exploiting their power solely to attack this President and undo the results of the 2016 election.”"

Here's the latest:

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: 'I was on the phone call' with Trump and Ukrainian President

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo admitted Wednesday that he was on the July 25 phone call in which President Donald Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.

""I was on the phone call,"" Pompeo said Wednesday during a news conference in Rome with Italy's foreign minister.

Some key context: A whistleblower complaint released last week alleges Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the 2020 election and that the White House took steps to cover it up. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

A rough transcript released by the White House shows Trump repeatedly pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, Trump's potential 2020 political rival, and his son Hunter Biden.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.

State Department inspector general requests urgent briefing on Ukraine with congressional staff

The State Department's inspector general on Tuesday requested an urgent briefing with senior congressional staff members after Pompeo pushed back on House Democratic demands to turn over documents related to Ukraine and to depose current and former State officials, according to sources briefed on the matter.

It remains unclear exactly what State Department Inspector General Steve Linick plans to provide Congress during the private briefing Wednesday.

Deposition for House impeachment investigation delayed

The aide said on Tuesday the testimony of former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, which had been scheduled for Wednesday, would now occur Oct. 11, following an agreement between the committee's and the former ambassador's counsel.

Three committees -- the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight panels -- have scheduled the depositions as part of their probe into whether Trump solicited help from a foreign government to dig up dirt on his political opponent.

Yovanovitch and Volker were two of the five depositions that the committees have scheduled during the next two weeks while Congress is on recess.

Giuliani hires a Watergate prosecutor as his attorney in impeachment inquiry

Florida attorney Jon Sale , who worked as an assistant prosecutor on the legal team investigating the Watergate scandal, is representing Giuliani in the matter of the congressional impeachment inquiry, both of them confirmed to CNN on Tuesday.

Giuliani was subpoenaed on Monday by the three committees in the House of Representatives investigating Trump's interactions with the Ukrainian government. The subpoena requests documents and correspondence from Giuliani related to Ukraine.

As a reminder, the whistleblower complaint labels Giuliani as ""central figure"" in the controversy. US officials were concerned, the whistleblower said, with Giuliani and his contacts with Ukrainian officials.

Key GOP senator breaks with Trump in saying the whistleblower 'ought to be heard out and protected'

Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chamber's most senior Republican and a longtime defender of whistleblowers, rebuked Trump on Tuesday when he said the whistleblower at the center of the impeachment inquiry ""appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected.""

His comments mark a clear departure from Trump and his allies, who in recent days have repeatedly maligned the whistleblower's motives and pushed to reveal the individual's identity.

Ukraine's President says he never met with Giuliani

""I never met Rudy Giuliani -- never. And never had any phone calls with him,"" Zelensky said Tuesday at a news conference in Kiev.

According to the White House transcript of the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky, the Ukrainian President said he was aware of Giuliani's efforts to uncover information that would help Trump politically, and Trump encouraged Zelensky to speak with his lawyer because Giuliani ""very much knows what's happening.""

Pompeo accuses House Democrats of intimidation and bullying over Ukraine controversy

""I'm concerned with aspects of the Committee's request that can be understood only as an attempt to intimidate, bully, & treat improperly the distinguished professionals of the Department of State, including several career FSOs,"" he tweeted.

The comments prompted House Democrats to issue a stark warning to the top US diplomat. The chairmen of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees told Pompeo that any effort to prevent those officials from speaking to Congress ""is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry.""

CNN reported Monday that Pompeo was on Trump's July call with Zelensky despite previously denying knowledge of the whistleblower complaint.

More news around Washington

How Lindsey Graham's support for Trump -- a man he once called a 'jackass' -- has evolved

Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is one of Trump's most vociferous defenders on Capitol Hill, but it wasn't always like that. In fact, Graham called Trump ""crazy and a ""jackass"" four years ago when he was running in the GOP presidential primary.

At the time, Trump wasn't so kind to Graham either, calling him a ""nut job.""

""This guy Lindsey Graham, he's one of the dumbest human beings I have ever seen,"" Trump said at a rally in South Carolina. ""He starts hitting me, saying vicious things, ends up with 0%. He left in disgrace.""

Don't assume the Senate would *never* impeach Trump

With the House headed down a path that virtually guarantees Trump will be impeached, conventional wisdom has settled on the idea that the Republican-led Senate will never, ever, remove him from office.

And, well, it's true that the strong likelihood is that the Senate acquits Trump, CNN's Chris Cillizza writes.

But if the Trump presidency -- and the way in which he became President -- teaches us anything, it should be this: Never assume. Anything.

Fact-checking Trump's false claim that the US is the only country providing aid to Ukraine

Trump has offered several explanations to justify his decision to delay military aid to Ukraine, first suggesting he was worried about ""corruption,"" then claiming the delay was a mechanism to pressure other countries to contribute.

On September 23, Trump voiced his complaint to reporters alongside Polish President Andrzej Duda, asking, ""Why is it always the United States spending money?"" and ""I don't like it that it's only us.""

Facts First: The US is not ""the only one"" contributing aid to Ukraine. Germany and France have both sent millions of euros to Ukraine, along with other European nations.

Connected by subpoenas: Giuliani and his Ukrainian middleman Lev Parnas face increased scrutiny

Parnas, a Ukrainian American businessman who has been subpoenaed as part of the House impeachment inquiry, has spent thousands of dollars on Trump properties and donated to the main super PAC supporting the President's reelection effort, according to documents produced in an unrelated federal lawsuit.

Starting in November 2018, Parnas introduced Giuliani to former and current Ukrainian officials, according to Giuliani.

Financial records uncovered as a result of a lawsuit filed in federal court in Florida earlier this year show Parnas spent thousands of dollars at Trump hotels in the fall of 2018, donated hundreds of thousands to the pro-Trump super PAC and received checks from Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm with deep connections to the Trump White House.

The financial ties between Trump's world and Parnas raise new questions about the nature of Parnas' relationship with Giuliani and who was paying the former New York mayor and Parnas for their research on Ukraine."

Elizabeth Warren unveiled a plan Thursday to give American workers more power, protections and higher wages.

The presidential hopeful's plan, posted to Medium, would extend labor rights to all workers, protect pensions, and strengthen workers' rights to organize, bargain collectively and strike. It would expand worker protections and combat discrimination.

""American workers don't have enough power,"" Warren argues in her post, because big corporations and their allies have waged a ""systematic attack on unions."" Warren, who has made anti-corruption and anti-big money central themes of her presidential bid, advocates for creating a ""stronger labor movement.""

The senator pledges to use executive action, to work with Congress and leverage the federal procurement process ""to pursue the most progressive and comprehensive agenda for workers since the New Deal.""

Warren, who officially launched her 2020 presidential bid at the site of a historic 1912 labor strike led by women and immigrants, writes in her new plan she wants to make it easier for unions to assert their rights, including the right to strike.

Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday released a new plan outlining how she would use the revenue generated by her proposed tax on ""excessive lobbying"" to beef up federal agencies charged with regulating major industries.

""This tax will reduce the incentive for excessive lobbying, and raise money that we can use to fight back against this kind of onslaught when it occurs,"" Warren wrote in a Medium post explaining the strategy.

First unveiled in broad strokes last month , Warren's plan would impose a 35% tax on lobbying expenditures between $500,000 and $1 million. The cost would escalate from there, with a 60% rate placed on every dollar beyond $1 million that rises to 75% once a company's lobbying costs surpass $5 million.

The proposal represents the newest piece of Warren's broad anti-corruption platform, which she has made central to her candidacy. It is the subject matter that Warren is most fluent in discussing and passionate about on the trail, where she often jokes that the ""good news"" is she has ""the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate,"" before waiting a beat and adding: ""Here's the bad news, we need the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate.""

In this chapter of her wider agenda, Warren stresses that the issue goes beyond Congress, lawmakers and the ""revolving door"" between Capitol Hill and K Street -- and addresses lobbyist influence on regulatory bodies.

W. Norton. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) If there's one thing that seems to scare Mark Zuckerberg to the bone, it's the threat of a functional government that represents the interests of its citizens. To him, government appears to be the faceless bureaucracy that slaps him on the wrist with a $5 billion fine when his company spies too much or too illegally on his users.

So when one of his employees asked him at an open meeting what he thought of Elizabeth Warren, Zuck was uncharacteristically candid -- as if triggered by the mere thought of the possibility that someone with so much faith in the power of big government could become our chief executive. She ""thinks the right answer is to break up the companies,"" he said . And even though he believes he would win a legal battle against the US government, he added, ""Does that still suck for us? Yes.""

Considering the company's actions over the past couple of years, this is a battle Zuckerberg has been anticipating and preparing for. Ever since the suggestion of breaking up Facebook was raised at the infamous congressional hearings Zuckerberg underwent in April 2018, he has been effectively circling the wagons.

Facebook's greatest vulnerability is the fact that it's not just one company, but a collection of different platforms and technologies they've purchased over the years. Breaking them up is as simple as, well, separating out these acquisitions. That's why his first move after Congress began asking questions was to integrate his various messaging platforms -- Instagram, WhatsApp -- into the Facebook platform. He argued that this was to offer greater interoperability and convenience. The real reason for such integration was to pre-empt any efforts to split up the company along its obvious fault lines.

Shortly after, Facebook announced it was going to launch a new cryptocurrency, already branded with a freedom-from-tyranny inspiring name, the ""Libra."" It has been widely assumed that Facebook's 2.4-billion user base would give the currency an instant edge over bitcoin and everybody else, perhaps even becoming a default global currency.

So, the new question becomes, will Zuckerberg peg the Libra on the dollar, supporting the United States' role as the world's most central banker? Or will the company base the Libra's value on a commodity, a basket of currencies, or something else entirely? The mere suggestion of such plans gives Facebook leverage over the government that might undertake to control it.

Would Zuckerberg really think and act this way? Of course he would. After all, as he told his gathering of employees, he's the one who sees this as a life-or-death battle: ""At the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.""

That's actually a scary thought to me. Facebook screwed up our 2016 elections -- and, arguably, civil society -- by serving as the unintentional conduit for divisive propaganda from near and far.

In a 2018 blog post , Facebook detailed how it planned to better prepare for future elections, which included identifying and removing fake accounts. So Facebook will begin using its employees' and AI's ""judgment"" to determine what sorts of messaging is appropriate for us.

Imagine how much influence the platform could have if its founder really perceived one of the candidates as an existential threat. Do we want to see what an election looks like where Facebook is actively involved, fighting for its life?

What Zuckerberg doesn't get is that Elizabeth Warren isn't simply protecting America from Facebook, but Facebook from itself. While government is responsible for making sure companies don't compete in unfair ways or infringe on people's basic civil liberties, it is also responsible for providing businesses with safe monetary and legal systems through which to operate.

As Warren tweeted , ""What would really 'suck' is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.""

Breaking up Facebook is far from the worst thing that could happen to the company. That would likely play out like the brooms in the Sorcerer's Apprentice, where each piece of the company animates and grows into its own threat to privacy and democracy. Instead of being bitten by a single great white shark, we get consumed by a thousand piranhas.

No, the real nightmare for Zuckerberg is not being broken up, but being regulated. And the more Facebook integrates its various pieces into one big platform, the easier it will be to monitor, legislate and penalize.

Regulation may be less dramatic than a breakup, but it's also more effective and ongoing. A living and perpetual responsibility. Facebook could grow so big and ubiquitous, it might even become a utility -- publicly owned and operated.

With her penchant for big government and detailed plans, Elizabeth Warren may be the only candidate willing to finally parent and discipline petulant CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg, who too easily mistake corporate power for personal liberty."

The poll – which surveyed 423 registered New Hampshire voters likely to vote in the Democrat primary from September 25-29, 2019 – showed Warren leading the primary field with 25 percent support and Biden on her heels with 24 percent support. Sanders, however, struggled to keep up, falling to a distant third place with just 11 percent support.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) came in fourth place, just one point behind the socialist senator, with ten percent support. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) tumbled to fifth place, failing to garner double digits in the Granite State, seeing just five percent support.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MI) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) saw three percent support, followed by Andrew Yang (D) and Tom Steyer (D), who garnered two percent support each. The remaining candidates saw one percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.8 percent:

New Hampshire Institute of Politics Executive Director Neil Levesque highlighted the sense of “fluidity” in the race, due to the fact that “65% of Warren supporters, 72% of Biden supporters, 56% of Sanders supporters, and 73% of Buttigieg voters indicate that they expect that their choice could change between now and the primary election.”

Levesque added:

Among voters who are not firm in their choice, Warren is the 2nd choice of 26%, well ahead of Biden with 12%, Buttigieg with 11%, Sanders with 7% and Harris with 7%. This suggests that when the field begins to winnow down, Warren may in the best position to pick up other candidates’ support. However, if this turns into a two-person race, the nomination may ultimately turn on what sort of candidate Democrats want to send against Donald Trump: one that they believe would make the best president, or one that they believe has the best chance of beating him. If the former, Warren has a clear 27% to 19% advantage over Biden on the question of whom respondents think would make the best President. However, Biden is seen as the strongest nominee against Trump by 37% of voters compared to Warren with 26%. As in our April poll, Warren leads Biden among ‘extremely interested’ and ‘very liberal’ voters, at 28% – 24% and 35% – 11% respectively.

The poll spells trouble for Sanders, who has been slipping in New Hampshire, as recent polls indicate.

A Monmouth Poll released last Tuesday showed a similar trend, with Warren edging out Biden (27 percent to 25 percent) and leading Sanders – who garnered 12 percent support – by double digits:

Reports emerged of a staffer shakeup for the Sanders campaign last month. The Sanders campaign moved presidential campaign operations state director Joe Caiazzo from New Hampshire to Massachusetts and replaced him with Shannon Jackson, who served as a senior adviser during Sanders’ 2016 presidential bid and ran his Senate reelection campaign.

While the Sanders campaign continues to reconfigure and strategize on how to win over New Hampshire as it did in 2016, the campaign reported a monstrous $25.3 million received in the third quarter, signaling that his campaign is in it for the long haul."

In the middle of the interview, Mann got stuck on a question: What was something he could share about his wife that the public didn't already know?

Suddenly, turning her attention towards the kitchen, Warren yelled out: ""Oooh!"" Bailey, the couple's 16-month-old golden retriever, had bounded into the sunroom, making a beeline for the senator and her husband.

""To the rescue! Bailey!"" Mann joked.

""Good boy,"" Warren said.

Hours earlier, Mann and Bailey had opened the side door of their Cambridge home, letting CNN reporters inside for the couple's first joint interview of the campaign. Mann's left hand was in a cast.

As Mann explained it, Bailey had recently been roaming off-leash in the neighborhood. He started playing with another dog, but soon ""the play stopped, and the other dog attacked him."" Mann got between the two dogs, and his hand caught on Bailey's harness, resulting in a broken finger.

Mann, a professor at Harvard Law School, headed over to campus to teach a class before taking himself to the emergency room.

Later, when Warren joined Mann for the joint interview, she wanted to set the record straight: ""Bailey got jumped.""

""Let's be clear. Bailey was jumped by another dog,"" she said. ""And Bruce went to Bailey's rescue.""

Sen. Elizabeth Warren's dog Bailey stands with her husband Bruce Mann as Warren addresses the media outside of her home after announcing she formed an exploratory committee for a 2020 Presidential run on December 31, 2018 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Both Warren and Mann have long been dog people. As Warren writes in her autobiography, ""A Fighting Chance,"" when she was teaching at the University of Pennsylvania years ago, a group of students surprised her with a golden retriever puppy on the last day of class.

In the course of their wide-ranging interview, Warren and Mann pointed to Bailey as one of the most important ways in which they have tried to keep a sense of calm this year as the Massachusetts senator has been running for President.

Their previous golden retriever, Otis, ""had gotten Elizabeth through"" her first Senate campaign in 2012, Mann said -- ""just by being this big fluffy golden.""

""Otis was the calm. You can do this. We'll get through this together,"" Warren said. ""I would often brush Otis while I'd be on a phone call.""

Otis died just days before Warren's Senate victory. It was a painful loss for the couple, and for years, they said, they couldn't fathom taking on everything that came with taking care of a dog again as Warren juggled her new job in Washington and Mann continued to teach at the law school.

But last summer, Mann saw an opening. One of their grandchildren was visiting, so he would be home in Cambridge for an extended period of time rather than commuting back and forth to Washington, DC. He seized the moment and brought Bailey home.

Now, as Warren runs for President, whenever she is home in Cambridge, the couple makes time to drive over to Fresh Pond with Bailey. A ""really good day,"" Warren said, is when they can do the loop around the pond twice in one day.

Getting Bailey last year ""probably made no sense at all,"" Warren said, but now, they ""can't imagine life without him.""

""And besides, there's really nothing better than a golden retriever puppy to create the illusion of normalcy,"" Mann said."

Warren and Biden are followed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders with 15%, California Sen. Kamala Harris and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 5% each, and businessman Andrew Yang and author Marianne Williamson with 2%. No one else received over 1% in the poll.

Patrick Murray, Monmouth University's polling director, acknowledged that their August poll -- which found Warren, Sanders, and Biden in a three-way tie -- was an outlier compared with other polling conducted around the same time. But the new Monmouth poll confirms other recent polling suggesting a far tighter race for the Democratic nomination.

It, along with a late-September Quinnipiac University poll , is the second recent national poll to show Warren and Biden topping the field and within the margin of error of each other, and the third to show Warren in the mid- to upper-20s in support.

While eight in 10 registered Republicans and Republican-leaning independent voters say Donald Trump ought to be re-elected President in 2020, 15% said someone else should be in office.

Bernie Sanders on his right and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to his left, for the next presidential debate, which will also feature a new face and a returning candidate among the dozen Democrats onstage vying for their party's nomination.

The stakes are incredibly high for the candidates participating in the CNN/New York Times Democratic presidential debate on October 15, as several candidates will likely need a breakout performance to remain competitive in this crowded primary field. For businessman Tom Steyer , it will be his first presidential debate, while Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard returns to the stage after failing to qualify for the September debate.

In all, 12 Democratic hopefuls will appear on the same stage for the debate: Biden, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, Gabbard, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Sanders, Steyer, Warren and businessman Andrew Yang.

The Democratic National Committee's fourth sanctioned primary debate will air live at 8 p.m. ET from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, a northeast suburb of the state capital, Columbus. CNN anchors Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper and New York Times national editor Marc Lacey will serve as the debate moderators.

The 12 campaigns were required to submit paperwork to the DNC Wednesday morning certifying that their respective candidate achieved the fundraising and polling thresholds required to participate in the October debate. To receive an invitation to this debate, candidates needed to attain at least 2% in four separate DNC-approved polls and receive contributions from at least 130,000 unique donors, including at least 400 donors from 20 different states.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) had surged past Biden into first place in the race for the Democratic Party’s 2020 presidential nomination.

A Monmouth Poll of early primary states released Wednesday found Warren (28%) ahead of Biden (25%) by 3% — barely within the poll’s 3.1% margin of error. A new YouGov/Economist poll found Warren (28%) ahead of Biden (22%) by 6%.

Moreover, the breaking news that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), 78, had been admitted to hospital for emergency heart surgery also drew attention to Biden’s age (76) and his own history of health problems.

Still, Biden wanted Trump — and Democrats — to know that he would fight on, in response to Trump’s charges that he and his son, Hunter, were “stone-cold crooked.” The Washington Post reported from his remarks, as prepared for delivery:

“Let me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me — I’m not going anywhere,” Biden will say. “You’re not going to destroy me. And you’re not going to destroy my family. I don’t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get.” … Biden said Trump sought to discredit him and his family because, “like every bully in history—he’s afraid. He’s afraid of just how badly I would beat him next November.”

The Post concluded its story by quoting Biden: “Nobody has ever asserted that I did anything wrong except he and what’s that fellow’s name? Rudy Udi? Giuliani?”

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has been hospitalized with serious heart problems, what had already been a bad week for former Vice President Joe Biden has just gotten even worse.

I’ll get to the why of that in a bit, but let’s first take a look at all the other bad news.

The Polls

As I have said since the beginning, the only polls I’m going to take seriously are post-Labor Day, after summer is over and people are actually paying attention to the race. It was and still is my belief that while enjoying the summer months, Democrat voters parked their votes on tried-and-true Uncle Joe but that this could change after people started to tune in.

Well, tuning in, they are, and Biden’s slide is very real and may not have yet reached bottom.

According to the Real Clear Politics poll of polls, Biden went from a double-digit national lead ten days ago to just a two-point lead today.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is climbing, is attracting the crowds, while Slow Joe falls and can hardly attract flies.

In the all-important early primary states, Biden is losing in Iowa, is only three points up in New Hampshire (Warren leads in the two most recent polls), and only two points up in Nevada. (Warren and Biden are tied in the latest poll.)

Biden’s firewall in South Carolina remains strong — he’s up by 22 points, but if he loses New Hampshire and Iowa, he will have to make history to win the Democrat nomination.

The Picture

Last month, Joe Biden told us, “I’ve never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.”

That is a flat-out lie.

This entire scandal revolves around Biden’s son Hunter, who made more than $50,000 a month — a month! — for sitting on the board of a Ukrainian oil company. The problem, of course, is that Hunter has no experience whatsoever in that field and that when Hunter scored that sweet gig, then-President Obama had put Joe Biden in charge of dealing with Ukraine.

What’s more, once a Ukrainian prosecutor began to look into Hunter’s company, Joe threatened to withhold crucial U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired — which he was.

Now, liars in the media, serial liars like Jake Tapper, are lying about this — saying the prosecutor was not looking into Hunter Biden’s company when Daddy Joe forced him out, but this very same prosecutor has signed an affidavit under penalty of perjury saying that he was.

Anyway, back to the lie…

To begin with, we know Daddy Joe spoke to Hunter about his shady, overseas business dealings because in an interview with the New Yorker, Hunter said they spoke about his shady, overseas business dealings.

But now, we have nothing less than photographic proof…

Look at this, y’all… An actual photograph of then-Vice President Joe Biden and his ne’er-do-well son out golfing with a board member of the company that hired No-Experience-Hunter.

That’s whatchoo call a clean bust.

The Pulmonary

While we all hope and pray Bernie Sanders makes a full and speedy recovery, the political reality of the matter is still the political reality of the matter.

While on the campaign trail, Bernie felt chest pains, was rushed to the hospital, and surgery was performed to implant two heart stents. Bernie is still in the hospital, his presidential campaign is suspended, as is his political advertising.

This is a serious and significant development, but not just for Bernie.

Bernie Sanders is 78-years-old.

Joe Biden will be 77 next month.

And let’s not forget that until today’s news, Bernie was by far the most robust and energetic of the two.

After all, it was Joe Biden’s eye that filled with blood on TV just a few weeks ago, and it was Joe Biden’s teeth that came loose during a national debate last month, and it has been Joe Biden taking it easy on the campaign trail, going on vacation, disappearing for days at a time, etc.

If Democrats are smart, they will remember the lesson of 2016 when an obviously frail, sickly, and weak Hillary Clinton collapsed into a van at that September 11 memorial event.

While I have always made fun of Bernie’s age, I have also always used him as an example of what a robust 78-year-old looks like, how it is possible to be virile and vibrant into your late seventies. In fact, I have used Bernie as an example to explain just how frail and old Joe Biden looks by comparison.

Nothing terrifies Democrats more than the idea of Trump’s second term, and Bernie’s health scare will probably serve as a reality check that will have them rethinking their support for these pushing-80 candidates. What they are imagining right now is what a catastrophe this would have been had Bernie won the general election.

Naturally, then, these thoughts are going to turn to Slow Joe and the fact that if this happened to Bernie, there is an even bigger chance it will happen to Joe, who was never as energetic or full of fire as Bernie.

This reality check could also hurt Warren, who is 70. If she wins the nomination, she will be 71 and the oldest presidential nominee (from either party) in history.

Sure, Warren seems spry and energetic but … so did Bernie.

Regardless, this has been a very bad week for Quid Pro Joe … and it is only Wednesday.

In public, Zuckerberg is all humility. Mark Zuckerberg: “I’m Really Sorry That This Happened” could be any headline about a Facebook data scandal in the past two years. His 2018 speech to European politicians was an apology. His remarks before Congress were an apology. After the Cambridge Analytica affair, Facebook took out full-page newspaper ads in ten newspapers, apologizing.

In private, however, the Facebook CEO sings a different tune, promising defiance against regulators and politicians, and joking about how he can’t be fired.

In leaked audio obtained by the Verge, Zuckerberg pledges to fight against any regulation of big tech pushed by Elizabeth Warren or any other politician.

That doesn’t mean that, even if there’s anger and that you have someone like Elizabeth Warren who thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies … I mean, if she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge….at the end of the day, if someone’s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.

He said it was particularly important that Facebook and other big tech companies aren’t broken up, because only they’re big enough to censor everyone — or stop “hate speech,” in the Facebook founder’s words.

You know, [breaking up big tech] doesn’t make election interference less likely. It makes it more likely because now the companies can’t coordinate and work together. It doesn’t make any of the hate speech or issues like that less likely. It makes it more likely because now … all the processes that we’re putting in place and investing in, now we’re more fragmented. [emphasis added]

He also mocked Twitter for not being big enough to censor as efficiently as Facebook.

It’s why Twitter can’t do as good of a job as we can. I mean, they face, qualitatively, the same types of issues. But they can’t put in the investment. Our investment on safety is bigger than the whole revenue of their company. [laughter]

Zuckerberg’s answer to global scrutiny from national governments? Just ignore them, if they’re not big enough to matter! (Fun fact, Facebook has revenues greater than the GDP of Serbia, and would be the 90th-wealthiest country in the world if it were a country).

I did hearings in the US. I did hearings in the EU. It just doesn’t really make sense for me to go to hearings in every single country that wants to have me show up and, frankly, doesn’t have jurisdiction to demand that.

Does the arrogance and the commitment to massive investments to fight “hate speech” concern you? Too bad — Zuckerberg isn’t going anywhere:

kind of have voting control of the company, and that’s something I focused on early on. And it was important because, without that, there were several points where I would’ve been fired. For sure, for sure…

In the early days of Facebook, reporters obtained a now-infamous message from Zuckerberg in which he mocked the platform’s users as “dumb f**cks” for trusting him with their personal data.

Insincere contrition in public, and cavalier arrogance in private. Not much has changed!

As the state's March 5 primary draws closer, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (23%), former Vice President Joe Biden (22%) and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont (21%) are now tied as the leaders in the field among likely voters who are either registered as Democrats or identify as Democratic-leaning independents in the new Public Policy Institute of California poll, which was conducted in mid- to late September after Harris' uneven performance in the last debate.

Harris tumbled from 19% in July to 8% in the new poll by the institute, failing to sustain the momentum she sparked with her first debate performance in June. She lost significant ground over the summer, while her chief rivals all solidified their standing among California voters.

In the July poll, Warren was at 15%, Sanders was at 12% and Biden was at 11% -- all trailing Harris, who got both a fundraising and a polling bounce after she delivered a fiery performance in the first debate in Miami by questioning the former vice president's past opposition to busing for the purpose of desegregating schools.

While it is often said that California tends to reflect the national state of play of the presidential race -- because it is so expensive to wage an intensive campaign in this vast and diverse state -- the new Public Policy Institute of California poll underscores that Harris does not seem to be drawing any advantage from the fact that she served as the state's attorney general and continues to serve constituents as the state's junior US senator.

People familiar with the talks say the union and company have been passing comprehensive proposals back and forth this week , narrowing the gaps between their positions. Nearly 50,000 workers have been on strike since September 16

The major sticking points in the talks: GM's use of temporary workers, bringing jobs back from Mexico, and the union's demand that GM revive some or all of the four US plants slated for closure . The company has already stopped production at an assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio , and transmission plants in Warren, Michigan, and Baltimore. Its Hamtramck assembly plant in Detroit is due to shut down early next year.

(CNN) President Donald Trump is betting that Americans will become so accustomed to his transgressions that they will become immune to outrage; that they will inoculate him against impeachment.

That may be why on Thursday he made a calculated tactical move. He c onfessed to asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden, and he publicly doubled down, urging yet another foreign government to interfere in US democracy. He suggested that China should investigate Biden, one of his leading opponents in the 2020 presidential election. (There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden in Ukraine. There's also no evidence that the former vice president received any money from China.)

But let's not confuse calculated and tactical with brilliant or clever. The move is part of Trump's ""stable genius"" playbook. Imagine confessing to an egregious abuse of power as a strategy for victory.

We know this was a planned maneuver because less than 24 hours earlier Trump was asked a question on the issue of Ukraine and he flailed awkwardly in front of a global audience. He was standing next to the visiting president of Finland, when Reuters reporter Jeff Mason insisted he answer, ""What do you or what did you want [Ukraine's] President Zelensky to do with regard to Joe and Hunter Biden?""

It was an embarrassing spectacle. The world took notice remarking on his startling behavior, as Trump irascibly demanded that Mason move on to questioning the Finnish president.

Shouting answers to shouted questions in the shadow of the helicopter on the White House lawn, the President copped to what many experts say is an impeachable offense -- using his office for political gain -- and then committed yet another such offense. But the second one was much worse than the one that already triggered an impeachment inquiry.

""What exactly did you hope Zelensky would do about the Bidens?"" asked a reporter. Trump responded, ""They should investigate the Bidens,"" immediately adding, ""Likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens.""

Only moments earlier, the President had noted that Chinese officials are headed to the United States next week for negotiations on the costly trade war that Trump has launched against China. He said: ""if they don't do what we want, we have tremendous, tremendous power.""

It recalled his request of a ""favor"" from the Ukrainian president—captured in a rough transcript of a phone call between Trump and Zelensky. Trump raised this ""favor""-- that Ukraine investigate Biden, just after Zelensky said he wanted to buy more Javelin missiles to defend against Russian-armed insurgents.

It was a reprisal of his 2016 call for Russian help , essentially ""China, if you're listening...""

This time, Chinese officials listening to Trump might surmise that obtaining a favorable trade deal with the United States may require helping the President win the election.

This time, Trump was asking not a friendly country, but a top geopolitical foe of the United States to interfere in America's elections, an even more jaw-dropping affront to the responsible conduct of US foreign policy.

This time, the White House didn't need to lock the transcript in a super-secure electronic system, as it did with the transcript of the Ukraine call. This time it was all out in the open.

When asked if he had talked about this with his Chinese counterpart, Trump appeared to issue a threat. ""I'm sure President Xi does not like being under that kind of scrutiny..."" he said , as he went on to spread more calumnies and innuendos about Biden.

Now we hear that Trump raised the matter with the Chinese president. In a call with Xi on June 18, according to CNN sources, Trump brought up Biden and Elizabeth Warren, his two leading contenders. The call was reportedly stored in the same ultra-secure server where the call with Ukraine's president was locked away.

If the Ukraine call is grounds for impeachment, we're going to need a bigger impeachment boat.

Why is Trump incriminating himself? The reasons are many. First, this strategy of smearing his opponent in conspiracy theories and enlisting the support of foreign governments worked well for him against Hillary Clinton in 2016, and back then he didn't have access to all the elements of power he possesses as president.

Second, Trump may believe that by speaking openly about what he has done, it will look like it's nothing to be ashamed of, perfectly normal, instead of an astonishing abuse of power and violation of his oath of office.

And third, Trump thinks he is invincible. This was yet another instance of unrestrained hubris; another case of him figuratively shooting someone on 5th Avenue , which, as he told us before, he thinks would not cost him a single vote.

Trump added even more wild conspiracy theories as the day progressed, fulminating against the ""impeachment crap,"" and suggesting without any evidence that the pharmaceutical industry is behind the impeachment inquiry.

At any other time in history, one single sentence from Thursday morning, one call for China to investigate a President's political opponent, would become the biggest story of the month, a threat to a presidency.

This time, the biggest story of a head-spinning month is impossible to declare. But his presidency, yes, is under threat by the President's own words and actions. Americans are outraged, and he has no inoculation against impeachment."
55,"Matthew Chance, Zahra Ullah and Eliza Mackintosh, CNN","Kiev, Ukraine (CNN)Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has told CNN that he had no knowledge about his prosecutor-general's offer to help US President Donald Trump investigate the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate to face him… [+3652 chars]",Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has told CNN that he had no knowledge about his prosecutor general's offer to help US President Donald Trump investigate the son of former Vice President Joe Biden.,2019-10-02,CNN,Ukraine's ex-president says he had no knowledge of prosecutor's offer to help Trump,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/02/politics/petro-poroshenko-ukraine-impeachment-intl/index.html,"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has told CNN that he had no knowledge about his prosecutor-general's offer to help US President Donald Trump investigate the son of former Vice President Joe Biden , a leading candidate to face him in the 2020 presidential election.

In a brief exchange in the capital Kiev on Wednesday, Poroshenko said he had no information and did not send one of his general prosecutors, Yuriy Lutsenko , to meet with Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.

Giuliani says he twice met with Lutsenko -- in New York in January 2019, then in Warsaw in February.

Giuliani previously told CNN that Lutsenko, who was prosecutor under Poroshenko and his successor Volodymyr Zelensky until August, shared information with him related to allegations that Biden thwarted an investigation into his son Hunter's business dealings with a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Biden or his son.

In an April interview with the Babel, a Ukrainian news outlet, Lutsenko confirmed Giuliani's account of their conversations.

The alleged investigation into Burisma and Biden was central to a July phone call in which Trump repeatedly asked Zelensky to look into the Biden family, while simultaneously withholding almost $400 million worth of military aid to Ukraine. Trump has denied his decision to delay the aid had anything to do with his desire for Ukraine to investigate Biden.

whistleblower complaint about that call has prompted an impeachment inquiry, focused on Trump and Giuliani's Ukraine dealings.

Asked whether he sent Lutsenko to meet Giuliani, Poroshenko said: ""I knew nothing about it.""

The former mayor of New York City has also repeatedly pushed a theory that the origins of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election can be traced back to Democrats' dealings in Ukraine. Giuliani told CNN he learned more about the Russian interference, as well as the Biden allegations, from Lutsenko.

But Lutsenko, whose hold on power was precarious following Ukraine's April presidential election, ultimately backed off some of his claims that Giuliani worked to amplify, including that his office was reopening its investigation into Burisma and Biden.

According to the whistleblower's complaint, Giuliani's interactions with Ukrainian officials prompted concern among US officials about the ""circumvention of national security decision-making processes.""

Giuliani told CNN he never heard about any of those concerns. ""If they were going to get upset about this, they should have gotten upset about it in January or February,"" he said.

On Wednesday, Poroshenko also denied ever speaking to Biden about his son's business interests in Ukraine. Nor, Poroshenko said, did he speak to former US President Barack Obama or Trump about any commercial or personal business dealings.

""We never, ever spoke about commercial activity but we spoke about the form of the prosecutor general office, created condition for the independence of that,"" Poroshenko said. ""And now, unfortunately, by the law adopted now by parliament, the independence of the prosecutor's office was completely ruined.""

Asked whether he had fired former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin -- Lutsenko's predecessor -- because ""he was investigating Burisma and Biden,"" Poroshenko said he did not want to get involved in US politics and said that all general prosecutors in his country should be completely independent.

Trump has repeatedly claimed Shokin was investigating Hunter Biden. For example, Trump alleged on September 21 that the media wanted to avoid talking about the ""Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son...""

But there is no evidence that Hunter Biden was himself ever under investigation."

The former Texas congressman and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate characterized Buttigieg's position as driven by political calculation.

""I was really offended by those comments,"" O'Rourke told reporters after a gun control policy forum in Las Vegas on Wednesday. ""And I think he represents a kind of politics that is focused on poll-testing and focus-group-driving and triangulating and listening to consultants, before you arrive at a position.""

O'Rourke's comments came after Buttigieg took an implicit swipe at O'Rourke -- as well as New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who was the first 2020 presidential candidate to support mandatory buy-backs -- on Wednesday.

He called mandatory buy-backs ""a shiny object makes it harder for us to focus"" on reforms that are more politically viable in Washington, where any new gun control measures would require Republican support given the GOP's Senate majority.

""As a policy, it's had mixed results,"" Buttigieg said. ""It's a healthy debate to have, but we've got to do something now.""

Mandatory buybacks are a dividing issue for the 2020 Democratic field at large. But O'Rourke's direct and personal rebuke of Buttigieg forced into the open a tension that has brewed for months between the two camps and their supporters. The two entered the race in the same lane: Both as generation-change candidates with viral appeal, both vying to be seen as alternatives to former Vice President Joe Biden.

O'Rourke's allies have been bitter about Buttigieg since early April, when he said in New Hampshire -- in a clear poke at O'Rourke -- that ""I hear the way you ingratiate yourself to voters is to stand on things.""

Both have lost altitude in recent months, though Buttigieg has remained a much stronger fundraiser and is ahead of O'Rourke in nearly all polls.

But the divide over mandatory buy-backs has offered the clearest view yet of their diverging approaches to politics -- with Buttigieg seeking to show he is able to stake out a sober middle ground and could function effectively in Washington, and O'Rourke relying on more emotional appeals to those wishing to shake up the political system.

Ongoing clash

Buttigieg often uses the term ""shiny object"" to describe something he views as a distraction. Shortly after his appearance at Wednesday's forum, Buttigieg was asked whether he would allow his hypothetical vice president's son or daughter to serve on a foreign board.

He responded by saying Trump is trying to ""change the subject"" away from his ""abuse of power.""

""Let's deal with that and not get caught in the shiny objects he's going to throw out,"" Buttigieg said.

But the mayor calling O'Rourke's signature gun proposal a ""shiny object"" set off the Texas Democrat and his campaign.

The two had already clashed in September , when Buttigieg said O'Rourke's push for mandatory buy-backs -- which he has called for in the wake of a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, Texas -- played into the hands of Republicans looking for reasons to back away from gun control measures at a time when Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell were ""at least pretending to be open to reforms.""

But the Las Vegas forum marked a clear escalation from O'Rourke.

After pointing to Buttigieg's comments, O'Rourke asked, ""How in the world can you say that to March For Our Lives,"" referring to the student-led group founded in the wake of last year's school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that co-hosted Wednesday's forum.

""How can you say that to survivors of mass shootings across this country? How can you say that to the majority of Hispanics in America, certainly in Texas, who fear that they will be the victims of a mass shooting inspired by racism, hatred, that's been welcomed into the open by this president, and has been armed with weapons of war?"" he said.

O'Rourke lashed out again in a text message conversation with BuzzFeed , saying that Buttigieg's comment was ""offensive to anyone who has been shot by one of these weapons or who fears being shot or has lost someone to an AR-15 or AK-47.""

For his part, Buttigieg on Wednesday laid out a more modest set of proposals broadly backed by the field of Democratic 2020 presidential contenders: closing loopholes that allow some guns to be sold without background checks; allowing states to adopt ""red flag"" laws that allow families or police to ask a judge to have a potentially dangerous person's guns taken away; and banning the sale of additional assault-style rifles.

""We can get background checks done now. We can get red flag laws done now. We can get something done about the new sale of assault weapons now. We cannot wait for these other debates to play out -- even if they're healthy debates -- to get that action done because lives are on the line,"" Buttigieg said.

Vying for the top tier

In the Democratic primary field, Booker was the first to call for mandatory buy-backs. O'Rourke announced his support in early August -- after the El Paso shooting -- and California Sen. Kamala Harris called it a ""good idea"" in early September.

However, Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden have opposed mandatory buy-backs. Biden instead this week proposed that owners of assault-style rifles be required to participate in an optional buy-back or register them with the government under the same law that strictly regulated machine guns in the wake of the gangland shootings of the early 1920s and '30s.

But what's striking about the O'Rourke-Buttigieg clash is that both are coming from a similar starting point: They are vying to vault into the top tier of a Democratic presidential race currently being dominated by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Buttigieg has positioned himself as a generational-change candidate with Midwest roots -- but also as a more moderate alternative to the party's most progressive candidates.

O'Rourke had offered similar appeal, with a Sun Belt bent. But his campaign changed direction in the wake of the El Paso shooting.

Previously O'Rourke had opposed mandatory buy-backs, saying as a Senate candidate in 2018 that he would not support taking away Americans' guns.

""To be clear, they should have them. If you purchased that AR-15, you own it, keep it. Continue to use it responsibly,"" O'Rourke said during that race.

But he said the shooting in his hometown had changed him.

""I know that this is not politically easy. It's frankly why far too few people have proposed it; it's frankly why I have not proposed it in the past,"" O'Rourke told CNN in El Paso in August, explaining his reversal. ""I've said, 'This is something we should consider, I want to think about it, I want to talk to people about it.' I've thought about it. I've talked to people. ... And now, beyond a shadow of a doubt, regardless of what it does to our prospects going forward, you've got to speak the truth and be clear about where the solutions are.""

He made headlines in the September Democratic presidential debate when he said that ""hell yes,"" he would take AR-15s and AK-47s away from their owners.

That drew a rebuke from Booker, who already supported mandatory buy-backs -- as well as a national gun licensing program. Booker again criticized O'Rourke on Wednesday in Las Vegas.

""He saw the horrors visiting his community,"" Booker said of O'Rourke's reversal on the issue. ""Are we going to have to wait until hell's lottery comes to your community? No, we are a better country.""

O'Rourke responded on stage that he wanted to give Booker ""all the credit in the world for being a leader on this.""

""So Cory's deal is, you know, he's trying to determine who got to which policy position first,"" O'Rourke told reporters afterward. ""My response to that is, we're both in the right place on this and so let's work together."""

Silicon Valley’s previous candidate of choice was Pete Buttigieg, but despite his popularity with liberal elites and NeverTrump neocons, the South Bend mayor failed to enthuse Democrat primary voters.

Now, progressives in tech appear to be warming to Elizabeth Warren, despite her vocal stance against companies like Facebook and Google.

Via CNBC:

This growing contingent of tech insiders looking to back Warren started to take shape in the second quarter when she raised at least $19 million. At that time, she saw two contributions from Chamath Palihapitiya, a Silicon Valley-based venture capitalist, a $2,800 donation from investor and former “Shark Tank” star Chris Sacca and a $2,500 contribution from John MacFarlane, the founder of audio company Sonos Inc. Warren has yet to announce how much she raised in the third quarter.

CNBC reports that business leaders are exhausted by political disruption, and want a period of stability — even if it means higher taxes and more regulation.

Business leaders are clamoring for clarity on policy, even more than the policies themselves, as the 2020 election gets closer, said Aquila. “What business is looking for is a period of stability and calm,” Aquila said. “It’s less a partisan issue and more about bringing economic conditions that allow businesses to focus on business instead of wondering about the political world every two minutes. Many CFOs have told me over the years, ‘I can deal with higher tax rates or lower tax rates. I just need to know what the tax rate will be.’”

Although Warren has attracted a reputation for her anti-big tech positions, she is less consistent on the matter than her populist primary opponent Tulsi Gabbard.

Whereas Gabbard has been consistent on the question of censorship, criticizing big tech companies for “throwing free speech out the window,” Warren has flip-flopped on the issue. She condemned Facebook for its power to “shut down debate” after it removed an ad for her campaign in March this year, but a few months later called for tech companies to censor criticism of Kamala Harris.

A longtime Republican foreign policy expert who was seen in the White House as not fully ""on the Trump train,"" Volker is now at the center of the impeachment inquiry examining allegations Trump deployed the machinery of state in a vendetta to target political rivals.

Volker's testimony, analysts say, could be damaging to the President and his allies.

Volker is seen as ""a well-respected straight shooter who is likely to testify in ways that will damage other Trump allies,"" Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, wrote in an emailed analysis. ""It's possible others, including key administration members like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General William Barr would also be forced out.""

Volker is also one of the State Department witnesses whose depositions to Congress Secretary of State Michael Pompeo tried to block, setting off a tussle with lawmakers who say they will interpret any effort to prevent the officials' appearances as obstruction.

Where will Volker appear and why?

Volker is now set to testify before the Intelligence, Oversight and Reform and Foreign Affairs committees behind closed doors.

Dozens of pages of documents were delivered to those House committees Wednesday on behalf of Volker ahead of his Thursday deposition, two sources familiar tell CNN.

What remains unclear is if the documents were cleared by the State Department to be handed over, or if they are considered Volker's personal documents. The State Department did not respond to CNN's request for comment.

The announcement about his appearance came just hours before Volker resigned from his State Department position Friday, following release of the whistleblower complaint and a White House transcript of Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

In that call, Zelensky made clear that Ukraine, vulnerable and weak in the face of Russian aggression, wanted to buy American anti-tank missiles. Trump answered: ""I would like you to do us a favor though.""

Trump pushed Zelensky to work with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Barr to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, who had business dealings in Ukraine. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.

Trump also urged Zelensky to find a Democratic National Committee computer server that the US intelligence community says was hacked by Russian intelligence during the 2016 election campaign. There is no evidence Ukraine had any involvement in the hack.

The whistleblower complaint said that a day after Trump's call, Volker and the US ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, met with Zelensky and provided advice about how to ""navigate"" Trump's demands.

The State Department said this summer that Volker put Ukrainian Presidential Adviser Andriy Yermak in contact with Giuliani, at Yermak's request.

A source familiar with Volker's thinking said he was trying to get the Biden-Giuliani issue off the table, given that it was a political effort and not one that he was meant to support in his State Department role.

Volker did not want the controversy to occupy the center of bilateral conversations either, the source said, and hoped that in connecting Giuliani with Yermak, it would lead to a conversation in which the Ukrainians would agree to look into the matter and it would eventually fizzle out in two or three years.

Giuliani, meanwhile, has repeatedly claimed that these meetings were arranged at the State Department's request, pointing to Volker as the official who reached out to arrange them and showing text exchanges on television to back up that claim.

In one of the texts Giuliani released, Volker is quoted as suggesting a phone call with Yermak and Giuliani. It is unclear just how involved Volker was with Giuliani's political efforts.

Giuliani's campaign

But Giuliani has directly pursued Ukrainian investigations into American politics and Trump's leading political rival Biden at least since the spring.

The former New York mayor has pushed for a probe into the call Biden made in 2016 -- alongside the European Union, International Monetary Fund and others -- for the removal of Ukraine's top prosecutor, who at one point had been investigating a Ukrainian natural gas company that had Biden's son, Hunter, as a board member.

The prosecutor wasn't seen as tackling corruption aggressively, a key requirement for Ukraine to be considered for membership in the European Union.

In May, Giuliani floated traveling to Ukraine to meet with Zelensky in an effort to push the country to investigate Biden, as well as matters connected to the release of negative information about Paul Manafort, the former chairman for Trump's 2016 campaign. He ultimately reversed course and decided not to go.

In August, Giuliani said he had spoken to Yermak several times over the phone and met him in Madrid.

On Wednesday, the State Department inspector general provided Congress with dozens of pages of documents that included materials Giuliani had given the department earlier this year. Those documents, which were obtained by CNN, included the unsubstantiated claims about Biden and his son that formed the basis of Trump's accusations in his July call with Zelensky.

The whistleblower said in the complaint that in his understanding, Volker was trying to ""contain the damage"" inflicted on US policy by Giuliani and help Ukrainian officials ""navigate"" Trump's requests.

If Volker knows details of Giuliani's efforts, lawmakers will likely probe to learn as much as they can.

Who is Volker?

Volker is the executive director of the McCain Institute, which focuses on leadership, and kept that position even after being tapped in July 2017 by former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to become special envoy to Ukraine.

He has served as an ambassador to NATO, a European and Eurasian affairs expert at the National Security Council, and a deputy assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia. He got his start at the CIA as an analyst.

As representative, Volker has been at the heart of efforts to keep US military and economic aid flowing to Ukraine. He had also been the US point-man in trying to get dialogue started between Russia and Ukraine over the separatist revolt in eastern Ukraine, now in its sixth year.

In Kiev, Volker was seen as a reliable advocate. Yermak told CNN Saturday that Volker's ""consistent and comprehensive support for Ukraine throughout his tenure means a lot for our country.""

But almost a week later, Pompeo and the State Department have said nothing on the record about Volker's resignation.

'The Trump train'

Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko tweeted that ""one could hardly overestimate"" Volker's contribution to strengthening of our strategic partnership"" with the US.

But Volker, who worked as a special representative on a part-time, volunteer basis, didn't have a close relationship with the White House. Volker was not on the July 25th call with Trump and during his tenure, never had a one-on-one meeting with the President, a source close to the former special representative said.

A White House source has told CNN that Volker, an ally and protegee of prominent Republican Trump critic Sen. John McCain, never became a member of the President's inner circle. And according to another source, after Volker's resignation, there was little love lost for him inside the White House, where he was seen as ""never fully on the Trump train.""

In a letter to trustees of the McCain Institute on Saturday, Volker wrote that Congress had requested his testimony and he would ""be complying with that request."""

Here's the latest:

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: 'I was on the phone call' with Trump and Ukrainian President

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo admitted Wednesday that he was on the July 25 phone call in which President Donald Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.

""I was on the phone call,"" Pompeo said Wednesday during a news conference in Rome with Italy's foreign minister.

Some key context: A whistleblower complaint released last week alleges Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the 2020 election and that the White House took steps to cover it up. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

A rough transcript released by the White House shows Trump repeatedly pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, Trump's potential 2020 political rival, and his son Hunter Biden.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.

State Department inspector general requests urgent briefing on Ukraine with congressional staff

The State Department's inspector general on Tuesday requested an urgent briefing with senior congressional staff members after Pompeo pushed back on House Democratic demands to turn over documents related to Ukraine and to depose current and former State officials, according to sources briefed on the matter.

It remains unclear exactly what State Department Inspector General Steve Linick plans to provide Congress during the private briefing Wednesday.

Deposition for House impeachment investigation delayed

The aide said on Tuesday the testimony of former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, which had been scheduled for Wednesday, would now occur Oct. 11, following an agreement between the committee's and the former ambassador's counsel.

Three committees -- the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight panels -- have scheduled the depositions as part of their probe into whether Trump solicited help from a foreign government to dig up dirt on his political opponent.

Yovanovitch and Volker were two of the five depositions that the committees have scheduled during the next two weeks while Congress is on recess.

Giuliani hires a Watergate prosecutor as his attorney in impeachment inquiry

Florida attorney Jon Sale , who worked as an assistant prosecutor on the legal team investigating the Watergate scandal, is representing Giuliani in the matter of the congressional impeachment inquiry, both of them confirmed to CNN on Tuesday.

Giuliani was subpoenaed on Monday by the three committees in the House of Representatives investigating Trump's interactions with the Ukrainian government. The subpoena requests documents and correspondence from Giuliani related to Ukraine.

As a reminder, the whistleblower complaint labels Giuliani as ""central figure"" in the controversy. US officials were concerned, the whistleblower said, with Giuliani and his contacts with Ukrainian officials.

Key GOP senator breaks with Trump in saying the whistleblower 'ought to be heard out and protected'

Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chamber's most senior Republican and a longtime defender of whistleblowers, rebuked Trump on Tuesday when he said the whistleblower at the center of the impeachment inquiry ""appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected.""

His comments mark a clear departure from Trump and his allies, who in recent days have repeatedly maligned the whistleblower's motives and pushed to reveal the individual's identity.

Ukraine's President says he never met with Giuliani

""I never met Rudy Giuliani -- never. And never had any phone calls with him,"" Zelensky said Tuesday at a news conference in Kiev.

According to the White House transcript of the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky, the Ukrainian President said he was aware of Giuliani's efforts to uncover information that would help Trump politically, and Trump encouraged Zelensky to speak with his lawyer because Giuliani ""very much knows what's happening.""

Pompeo accuses House Democrats of intimidation and bullying over Ukraine controversy

""I'm concerned with aspects of the Committee's request that can be understood only as an attempt to intimidate, bully, & treat improperly the distinguished professionals of the Department of State, including several career FSOs,"" he tweeted.

The comments prompted House Democrats to issue a stark warning to the top US diplomat. The chairmen of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees told Pompeo that any effort to prevent those officials from speaking to Congress ""is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry.""

CNN reported Monday that Pompeo was on Trump's July call with Zelensky despite previously denying knowledge of the whistleblower complaint.

More news around Washington

How Lindsey Graham's support for Trump -- a man he once called a 'jackass' -- has evolved

Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is one of Trump's most vociferous defenders on Capitol Hill, but it wasn't always like that. In fact, Graham called Trump ""crazy and a ""jackass"" four years ago when he was running in the GOP presidential primary.

At the time, Trump wasn't so kind to Graham either, calling him a ""nut job.""

""This guy Lindsey Graham, he's one of the dumbest human beings I have ever seen,"" Trump said at a rally in South Carolina. ""He starts hitting me, saying vicious things, ends up with 0%. He left in disgrace.""

Don't assume the Senate would *never* impeach Trump

With the House headed down a path that virtually guarantees Trump will be impeached, conventional wisdom has settled on the idea that the Republican-led Senate will never, ever, remove him from office.

And, well, it's true that the strong likelihood is that the Senate acquits Trump, CNN's Chris Cillizza writes.

But if the Trump presidency -- and the way in which he became President -- teaches us anything, it should be this: Never assume. Anything.

Fact-checking Trump's false claim that the US is the only country providing aid to Ukraine

Trump has offered several explanations to justify his decision to delay military aid to Ukraine, first suggesting he was worried about ""corruption,"" then claiming the delay was a mechanism to pressure other countries to contribute.

On September 23, Trump voiced his complaint to reporters alongside Polish President Andrzej Duda, asking, ""Why is it always the United States spending money?"" and ""I don't like it that it's only us.""

Facts First: The US is not ""the only one"" contributing aid to Ukraine. Germany and France have both sent millions of euros to Ukraine, along with other European nations.

Connected by subpoenas: Giuliani and his Ukrainian middleman Lev Parnas face increased scrutiny

Parnas, a Ukrainian American businessman who has been subpoenaed as part of the House impeachment inquiry, has spent thousands of dollars on Trump properties and donated to the main super PAC supporting the President's reelection effort, according to documents produced in an unrelated federal lawsuit.

Starting in November 2018, Parnas introduced Giuliani to former and current Ukrainian officials, according to Giuliani.

Financial records uncovered as a result of a lawsuit filed in federal court in Florida earlier this year show Parnas spent thousands of dollars at Trump hotels in the fall of 2018, donated hundreds of thousands to the pro-Trump super PAC and received checks from Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm with deep connections to the Trump White House.

The financial ties between Trump's world and Parnas raise new questions about the nature of Parnas' relationship with Giuliani and who was paying the former New York mayor and Parnas for their research on Ukraine."

The 78-year-old presidential candidate underwent an emergency heart procedure after experiencing chest discomfort at a campaign event on Tuesday evening. A medical evaluation determined that he had a blockage in an artery, and two stents were “successfully inserted,” according to Sanders’ Senior Advisor Jeff Weaver.

Thomas Massie (R-KY) questioned Wednesday whether Democrat senators running for president should recuse themselves from a possible impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, suggesting it serves as a possible conflict of interest.

Rep. Massie, a member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, wrote Wednesday whether 2020 Democrat presidential candidates in the Senate have a “conflict of interest” when it comes to a potential impeachment of President Trump.

Congressman Massie asked rhetorically, “Don’t senators running for POTUS have a conflict of interest regarding possible impeachment of an opponent? Shouldn’t they recuse themselves if it came to the Senate??

Wouldn’t anyone so positioned against a defendant be barred from serving as a judge or jury in a court of law? — Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) October 2, 2019

He added, “Wouldn’t anyone so positioned against a defendant be barred from serving as a judge or jury in a court of law?” Several leading Democrat presidential candidates and senators have come out in favor of impeaching President Trump, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Amy Klobucar (D-MN) have all come in favor of impeachment.

The congressman’s contention might suggest that the Democrat senators might have a conflict of interest in that their support for impeaching President Trump might further their chances for becoming president of the United States. Rep. Massie’s tweet arises as House Oversight Republicans have continued to rail against House Democrats’ efforts to target State Department officials regarding their impeachment inquiry into President Trump. House Oversight and Reform Committee ranking member Jim Jordan (R-OH) said Tuesday that Democrats have continued to engage in “abusive targeting” of State Department officials. In response to the Democrat depositions as well as Secretary Pompeo’s letter, House Oversight ranking member Jim Jordan (R-OH) said that the House Oversight Republicans have “serious concerns” about Democrats’ “abusive targeting” of State Department officials. The Ohio conservative said that the Democrats’ depositions will put the nation’s national security at risk. “We have serious concerns about Democrats’ abusive targeting of our career foreign service professionals, which would put our nation’s diplomatic interests at risk,” Congressman Jordan said. “The Democrats are choosing confrontation over cooperation and exploiting their power solely to attack this President and undo the results of the 2016 election.”"

The exact reason for the cancelation remains largely speculative. While it could signal a drastic shift in strategy, the news coincided with the campaign’s announcement of Sanders’ emergency heart surgery. Doctors inserted two stents to treat an arterial blockage after Sanders experienced chest pain at a Tuesday campaign event.

Sanders’ Senior Advisor Jeff Weaver said the presidential candidate is in “good spirits” and will be resting up over the next few days. Because of that, all future campaign events and appearances are canceled “until further notice.”

The most important finding in this poll is the following: “Democrats are only consolidating their own base” with respect to impeachment.

That is exactly right, and that is what we are seeing in every poll gauging impeachment. The elite media headlines scream, “Support for Impeachment Rises!” Yeah, to 44 percent or 46 percent, which means only Democrats are on board.

So what?

The NRCC poll found that in battleground congressional districts, meaning the districts that will be up for grabs in 2020, that “Two-thirds (63%) of voters in NRCC target seats and 66% of voters in Republican-held battleground seats agree that Democrats in Congress are too obsessed with impeaching the President[.]”

What voters would prefer, according to the poll, is a Congress “working on issues they campaign on such as funding our military, improving the nation’s infrastructure, lowering the cost of prescription drugs, and caring for our nation’s veterans.”

In worse news for Democrats, “the top priority for voters in NRCC target seats is immigration and in Republican-held battleground seats is the economy.”

The NRCC found six separate issues, “that reach double digit importance for voters and Democrats aren’t focusing on any of them.”

On the overall issue of impeachment, the NRCC numbers align with the polls we are seeing from the media, polls that once again show nothing more than the Democrats consolidating their base of support on the issue.

“In NRCC target seats, voters oppose impeachment: 44% support – 47% oppose. In Republican-held battleground seats voters oppose impeachment: 46%-49%.”

What’s more, in these target districts, 51 percent of Independents oppose impeachment and 46 percent of “voters in NRCC target seats are less likely to vote for a candidate for congress who supports impeachment.”

Feel free to write the poll off as partisan, but as I mentioned above, it aligns perfectly with the media’s impeachment polls and analysis from the Wall Street Journal, which is no fan of Trump:

There is no position Democratic Rep. Kendra Horn can take on impeaching President Trump that will satisfy a majority of voters in the district she narrowly won last year, which Mr. Trump won by nearly 14 points. Republicans say the House probe, which was designated an impeachment investigation last week, is a baseless attempt to undo the 2016 election. They dismiss Ms. Horn’s technical objection to the impeachment label—she is among roughly 10 House Democrats to do so—as politically transparent. Some Democrats, meanwhile, want her to align with progressives and back impeachment, while others want to avoid a battle that could prove costly to taxpayers. … Ms. Horn beat a Republican incumbent last year by about 3,000 votes in a district that wasn’t on Democrats’ radar because of Mr. Trump’s margin of victory in 2016. Speaking after a town hall Monday, she called “irresponsible” her colleagues’ decision to move toward impeachment without a full investigation beyond the release of the transcript of the president’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and whistleblower complaint.

Democrats are also facing opposition to impeachment through anti-impeachment protesters, and some of those Democrats, like Rep. Lucy McBath (D-GA), are not handling the unexpected blowback very well. Her office dialed 911 on the protesters and had them removed by police.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), the current frontrunner for the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination, also got a taste of the protests.

Forty-five Republicans have joined the resolution, sponsored by House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs (R-AZ), to condemn Schiff for retelling a fabricated conversation between Trump and Zelensky. Biggs sponsored H. Res. 604, and it quickly gained support throughout the House Republican conference.

When Biggs sponsored the bill, he said that Schiff’s stunt was “inexcusable” to “mislead the American public with such a statement.”

Although a public list of cosponsors only shows 18 Republicans supporting the resolution, an internal GOP list obtained by Breitbart News shows that 45 Republicans have joined the list of GOP lawmakers to condemn Schiff. This represents a growing movement of Republicans to fight back against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) and Democrats’ move to impeach Trump.

The Republicans that have cosponsored Biggs’ resolution to condemn Schiff include:

Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) Steve Scalise (R-LA) Mark Green (R-TN) Mark Meadows (R-NC) Jeff Duncan (R-SC) Mo Brooks (R-AL) Scott Perry (R-PA) Greg Steube (R-FL) Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA) Rick Crawford (R-AR) Michael Burgess (R-TX) Jim Jordan (R-OH) Paul Gosar (R-AZ) Bill Posey (R-FL) Warren Davidson (R-OH) Bob Gibbs (R-OH) Jody Hice (R-GA) Ralph Norman (R-SC) Matt Gaetz (R-FL) Ron Wright (R-SC) Louie Gohmert (R-TX) Lance Gooden (R-TX) Ralph Abraham (R-LA) Jim Banks (R-IN) Daniel Meuser (R-PA) Bill Flores (R-TX) Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) Randy Weber (R-TX) Tim Burchett (R-TN) Dan Bishop (R-NC) Daniel Webster (R-FL) Mark Walker (R-NC) Gary Palmer (R-AL) Michael Cloud (R-TX) Doug Lamborn (R-CO) Fred Keller (R-PA) Elise Stefanik (R-NY) Brian Babin (R-TX) Bradley Byrne (R-AL) Bill Johnson (R-OH) Larry Buschon (R-IN) Liz Cheney (R-WY) Ted Budd (R-NC) Steve King (R-IA) Buddy Carter (R-GA)

Republicans have quickly mounted an offensive against Schiff and his misrepresentation of the conversation between Trump and Zelensky.

Keller announced Thursday that he will join a growing list of Republicans planning to condemn House Intelligence Committee Chairman Schiff for retelling a fabricated conversation between Trump and Zelensky.

Keller said that Schiff has led a “rigged political witch hunt” and that Republicans must hold him accountable. The Pennsylvania conservative said:

We now know what we’ve suspected all along: the ‘impeachment inquiry’ being undertaken by Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Schiff, and the socialist House Democrats is nothing short of a rigged political witch hunt that seeks to delegitimize our duly-elected President. Chairman Schiff has made a mockery of this solemn process and the Democrats leading the impeachment charge have strayed far afield of the Constitutional impeachment parameters. Their continued pursuit of impeachment is wrong, the nonsense must stop, and Chairman Schiff should be held accountable for his actions both prior to the committee’s hearing last week as well as during. It’s time to stop with the litigating and investigating and return to legislating for the benefit of the American people.

House Republican Leader McCarthy said that Schiff is “desperate” to damage Trump.

“Chairman Adam Schiff has been lying to the American people for years. Now he is so desperate to damage the president that he literally made up a false version of a phone call,” McCarthy wrote on Twitter Wednesday. “Enough is enough. I have signed a resolution to censure Schiff in the House of Representatives”:

McCarthy said on Fox News Wednesday that not only should Schiff be censured, but that he should be removed from his chairmanship. McCarthy also slammed Schiff for not revealing that the intelligence officer “whistleblower” contacted a House Intelligence Committee staffer before filing his complaint with the intelligence community inspector general.

“He has no credibility to be a chairman; he has no right to be the prosecutor in this case,” McCarthy said."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is vowing to implement a full open borders policy at the United States-Mexico border where border crossers and illegal aliens would rarely be detained.

Warren took to Twitter on Thursday to commit that she, as president, will not “unnecessarily” detain border crossers and illegal aliens who arrive at the southern border.

“Too many immigrants have died in ICE custody,” Warren said. “We need to ensure asylum seekers are welcomed, treated humanely, receive the medical care they need, and are not detained unnecessarily. I have a plan to rebuild a more humane immigration system.”

Too many immigrants have died in ICE custody. We need to ensure asylum seekers are welcomed, treated humanely, receive the medical care they need, and are not detained unnecessarily. I have a plan to rebuild a more humane immigration system. https://t.co/v3OZZHeGPd — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 3, 2019

Warren’s statement came in response to a report that a Cameroon national detained by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency had died while in custody. Unmentioned, though, is that migrant deaths under the Trump administration are 20 percent lower than the rate of migrant deaths under former President Obama.

The promise is just the latest remark where Warren has promoted the donor-class platform of hemispheric open borders between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, as well as Central and South America. The same position has been accepted by the billionaire Koch brothers donor network, failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and the big business lobby.

On Sunday, Warren told American union workers that increasing foreign competition against them in the labor market by giving amnesty to the roughly 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S. would be “good” for them.

“[Amnesty for all illegal aliens] is good for all workers, and we need to get them into our unions,” Warren said.

High levels of immigration, illegal and legal, put downward pressure on U.S. wages while redistributing about $500 billion in wealth away from America’s working and middle class and towards employers and new arrivals, research by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine has found.

Research by analyst Steven Camarotta has found that every one percent increase in the immigrant portion of American workers’ occupations reduces their weekly wages by about 0.5 percent. This means the average native-born American worker today has his weekly wages reduced by perhaps 8.5 percent because of current legal immigration levels.

While Warren seeks to increase foreign competition against American workers, President Trump has pursued policy initiatives to decrease foreign competition, increasing U.S. wages and giving American workers leverage over businesses.

Elizabeth Warren unveiled a plan Thursday to give American workers more power, protections and higher wages.

The presidential hopeful's plan, posted to Medium, would extend labor rights to all workers, protect pensions, and strengthen workers' rights to organize, bargain collectively and strike. It would expand worker protections and combat discrimination.

""American workers don't have enough power,"" Warren argues in her post, because big corporations and their allies have waged a ""systematic attack on unions."" Warren, who has made anti-corruption and anti-big money central themes of her presidential bid, advocates for creating a ""stronger labor movement.""

The senator pledges to use executive action, to work with Congress and leverage the federal procurement process ""to pursue the most progressive and comprehensive agenda for workers since the New Deal.""

Warren, who officially launched her 2020 presidential bid at the site of a historic 1912 labor strike led by women and immigrants, writes in her new plan she wants to make it easier for unions to assert their rights, including the right to strike.

Bernie Sanders' massive haul.",2019-10-04,CNN,"Elizabeth Warren raises $24.6 million in third quarter, reinforcing status among 2020 front-runners",https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/04/politics/elizabeth-warren-third-quarter-fundraising/index.html,"(CNN) Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren raised $24.6 million over the past three months, her campaign said Friday morning, falling just short of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' massive haul.

Warren's momentum in the polls, in which she has emerged as a front-runner alongside former Vice President Joe Biden, has been mirrored by a continued rise in small dollar fundraising. She brought in only $6 million during a disappointing first quarter, then jumped to $19.1 million in the second before a breakout summer that saw her outpace Biden by more than $9 million

Earlier in the week, Sanders announced a $25.3 million third quarter total, which set the pace for the 2020 Democratic field. Warren landed just shy of that number, but is well-positioned now to expand her campaign, which has $25.7 million in cash-on-hand, according to the campaign, as the first round of caucuses and primaries approach.

Campaign manager Roger Lau, in an email to supporters, said more than 500,000 people made more than 940,000 contributions to the campaign during the third quarter. The majority of those donors -- 300,000 -- gave to Warren for the first time during that period, Lau said, for an average contribution of $26. Since she entered the race on New Year's Eve, an estimated 750,000 people have given to Warren's campaign.

Warren's impressive total underscores the power of small dollar donors in the 2020 Democratic contest. Both she and Sanders have forsworn high-dollar fundraisers, but combined, they outraised Biden, California Sen. Kamala Harris and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, all of whom have tapped wealthy donors, by $4 million this quarter: $49.9 million to $45.9 million.

McDaniel declined a request from CNN for an interview. In the same written statement, McDaniel said he had ""tremendous respect"" for his former colleagues on the campaign ""despite any disagreements,"" and that he wished the campaign well.

The tagline — with its unfortunate double-meaning — was reported by the Washington Post, which obtained excerpts of the speech in advance, merely hours after several new polls suggested that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) had surged past Biden into first place in the race for the Democratic Party’s 2020 presidential nomination.

A Monmouth Poll of early primary states released Wednesday found Warren (28%) ahead of Biden (25%) by 3% — barely within the poll’s 3.1% margin of error. A new YouGov/Economist poll found Warren (28%) ahead of Biden (22%) by 6%.

Moreover, the breaking news that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), 78, had been admitted to hospital for emergency heart surgery also drew attention to Biden’s age (76) and his own history of health problems.

Still, Biden wanted Trump — and Democrats — to know that he would fight on, in response to Trump’s charges that he and his son, Hunter, were “stone-cold crooked.” The Washington Post reported from his remarks, as prepared for delivery:

“Let me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me — I’m not going anywhere,” Biden will say. “You’re not going to destroy me. And you’re not going to destroy my family. I don’t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get.” … Biden said Trump sought to discredit him and his family because, “like every bully in history—he’s afraid. He’s afraid of just how badly I would beat him next November.”

The Post concluded its story by quoting Biden: “Nobody has ever asserted that I did anything wrong except he and what’s that fellow’s name? Rudy Udi? Giuliani?”

CNBC reports that during a livestreamed employee Q&A call this week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed a number of topics including politics. Zuckerberg was asked to respond to Senator Bernie Sanders’s comment that billionaires should not exist, and gave a surprising answer given that Zuckerberg himself is worth $69 billion.

“I understand where he’s coming from,” Zuckerberg said. “I don’t know that I have an exact threshold on what amount of money someone should have but on some level no one deserves to have that much money.”

Zuckerberg was also asked about comments he made during two separate leaked internal Q&A sessions he had with employees in July. Zuckerberg is quoted as saying: “You have someone like Elizabeth Warren that thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies … I mean, if she gets elected president then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.”

Zuckerberg adds: “And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don’t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. I mean, that’s not the position that you want to be in when you’re, you know, I mean … It’s like, we care about our country, and want to work with our government and do good things. But look, at the end of the day, if someone’s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and fight.”

Zuckerberg stated in the recent public Q&A that he stands by his comments about Warren but added: “let’s try not to antagonize her further.” Zuckerberg was also asked about how the firm determines what counts as fake news that should be removed, Zuckerberg clarified that the main objective is to stamp out “complete and obvious hoaxes.”

“When we talk about misinformation, a lot of people focus on a statement that isn’t clear if it’s a shade of true or partially false,” he said. “There’s a lot of stuff that people say that is completely false. That’s the thing that I’m really focused on and making sure that we [stop].”

The Trump campaign and RNC took in $13 million in the three days following the announcement of the partisan-driven impeachment inquiry. That is “significantly more than most of the Democrat presidential candidates are able to raise in a whole quarter,” Parscale noted in an op-ed.

The entities raised a combined $5 million in the 24 hours following Pelosi’s announcement:

Voters vote with their wallets… and we are winning! You can not FAKE NEWS THAT. https://t.co/Ze29Iu0XTh — Brad Parscale (@parscale) September 25, 2019

While Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) reported a beefy $25.3 million in the third quarter, Sen. Elizabeth Warren raised $24.6 million, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) reported $19.1 million, several candidates saw numbers relatively the same – or lower – than the Trump campaign and RNC’s three-day spike:

Joe Biden: $15.2 million

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA): $11.6 million

Andrew Yang (D): $10 million

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ): $6 million

Marianne Williamson (D): $3 million

Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO): $2.1 million

“The sudden flood of donations to President Trump’s reelection effort provides undeniable evidence that this impeachment gambit represents a massive miscalculation,” Parscale noted, arguing that the impeachment effort is “already coming apart at the seams.”

Parscale said Democrats are using the impeachment effort as a mass distraction, albeit one that is backfiring. He predicts it could pose an issue for vulnerable Democrats in swing districts and result in “serious losses” for Democrats, who desperately want to maintain a majority in the House.

He wrote:

If this week’s GOP fundraising haul is any indication, Pelosi didn’t just drive another nail into the coffin awaiting the Democrats’ nominee next year, she may also be looking at serious losses in the swing House districts that handed her the speaker’s gavel in 2018. The moderate Democrats in those seats are already being put on the spot by the impeachment push. Their Republican challengers are poised to hold them accountable back in their home districts, hoping to ensure that those freshman legislators find themselves out of office next year. The true toll of the Democrats’ decision to proceed with this Ukraine farce, of course, is the damage it is already inflicting on our government institutions. The American people won’t look kindly on their politicization of a process that exists as a last resort in a genuine crisis — which this clearly is not.

“We know that this charade won’t result in Donald Trump leaving office, but it may well result in many Democrats leaving theirs,” Parscale concluded.

The White House record of that call was later stored in the highly secured electronic system used to house a now-infamous June 25 phone call with Ukraine's president. That call helped spark a whistleblower complaint which led House Democrats to open an impeachment inquiry into Trump.

Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

The former vice president discussed his fundraising haul during a fundraiser in Palo Alto, California, on Thursday, telling donors, ""We raised, this last quarter, $15 million -- in the middle of summer.""

Biden was bested in the money race last quarter by Sanders, who reported raising $25 million, and Buttigieg, who raked in $19 million.

But Biden's July to September fundraising haul is higher than the $11.6 million raised by California Sen. Kamala Harris, the $10 million raised by businessman Andrew Yang, and the $6 million brought in by New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. Author Marianne Williamson raised $3 million and Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet raised $2.1 million last quarter.

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has started to rise in recent polling as a clear front-runner alongside Biden, has yet to release her fundraising total.

The text messages, which were released by the House Intelligence Committee, underscore how Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was closely connected to US policy on Ukraine and was involved in setting up the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky, in which Trump also urged an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.

They show how cognizant the Ukrainians were about the importance of the election investigation to Trump and Giuliani's role.

On the morning of the call, in an exchange with a key adviser to the Ukrainian President, then-US Special Envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker made clear that it was important to the White House that Zelensky convince Trump that an investigation into the 2016 election would happen.

""Heard from the White House -- assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate/'get to the bottom of what happened' in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington,"" Volker said via text to the Ukrainian adviser on the morning of July 25.

Volker provided Congress with the text messages ahead of his closed-door congressional testimony on Thursday before three committees leading the House's impeachment inquiry into Trump and Ukraine.

The messages released by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee add a new layer of detail to the whistleblower complaint that prompted the impeachment inquiry, which alleged that Trump had urged the Ukrainian government to dig up dirt on his political rival, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.

That Trump wanted an investigation was a message that seemed to register with the Ukrainian administration. Volker and the Ukrainian adviser, Andrey Yermak, continued to text after the call about Zelensky making a public statement ahead of a meeting between the two leaders.

""I think potus really wants the deliverable,"" US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland texted Volker on August 9, as the two were talking about possible dates for a meeting.

""Once we have a date, will call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the US-UKRAINE relationship, including among other things Burisma and election meddling in investigations,"" Yermak wrote to Volker the following day.

Ukrainians drafted statement about starting investigation

A source familiar with the matter tells CNN that the Ukrainian government wrote the initial draft of a statement for public release, committing to pursue investigations of corruption.

The source told CNN that the Ukrainians drafted the statement to demonstrate to Trump and Giuliani, who they knew had influence with Trump, that there was a new team in Ukraine with Zelensky that was committed to cleaning up corruption.

The statement was shared with Volker and Sondland, who then shared it with Giuliani, according to the source. Giuliani told Volker that it did not go far enough and suggested inserting references to pursuing probes of Burisma and the 2016 election, although it did not mention the Bidens. Burisma is the Ukrainian company that hired Hunter Biden to be on its board.

Volker and Sondland then exchanged text messages about the draft, which Volker said he would share with an adviser to Zelensky. The Ukrainians told Volker they were not comfortable with the suggested statement, and the matter was ultimately dropped while a meeting between Zelensky and Trump continued to be pursued, the source said.

The source explained the context of the statement about the investigation after the discussion was included in the text messages provided to Congress ahead of Volker's testimony.

Giuliani told CNN after The New York Times first reported the existence of the statement that he ""never saw it or even draft of it.""

""This is their testimony if it is and not part of my role,"" he texted. ""They have to explain it. Lots of things going on I didn't know about.""

'it's crazy to withhold security assistance'

Ahead of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky, the text messages show how Giuliani was pushing for the call and for Zelensky to talk up the investigation.

""Had breakfast with Rudy this morning—teeing up call with Yermak Monday,"" Volker wrote to Sondland on July 19. ""Must have helped. Most (important) is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation—and address any specific personnel issues—if there are any.""

A rough transcript released by the White House shows that during the call, Trump repeatedly pushed Zelensky to investigate Biden, Trump's potential 2020 political rival, and his son.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.

Volker testified to the House committees Thursday that he had urged the Ukrainians not to interfere in US politics, and that the Ukrainians were concerned about the meeting being put on hold, according to two sources familiar with the testimony.

In August, it was publicly revealed that the Trump administration was holding up foreign aid to Ukraine, although the whistleblower complaint had not yet been made public.

Behind the scenes, concerns were being raised by a senior US diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, that the aid had been held up.

""Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?"" Taylor texted Sondland on September 1.

""Call me,"" Sondland responded. The context of Taylor's text message is not clear from the messages released by the committee.

A week later, Taylor was even more concerned, texting Sondland: ""As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.""

Sondland responded, ""Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.""

Sondland then suggested that if Taylor had additional concerns, he should reach out to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's assistant.

The subpoena came after the three committees leading the impeachment inquiry separately sent a letter Friday seeking documents from Vice President Mike Pence as part of their investigation into Trump and his conversation with the President of Ukraine.

The subpoena from House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings to the White House includes a request for a host of documents and communications tied to the President's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the holding up of foreign aid to Ukraine and efforts by Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his associates to push the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Joe Biden and Burisma, the company that hired Hunter Biden's son Hunter Biden to be on its board, according to a memo Cummings sent on the subpoena earlier this week.

""We deeply regret that President Trump has put us — and the nation — in this position, but his actions have left us with no choice but to issue this subpoena,"" Cummings of Maryland, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of California and House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel of New York wrote in a letter to the White House on Friday.

The subpoena escalates the Democratic impeachment investigation, which stems from the whistleblower complaint alleging Trump sought help from Ukraine's government to dig up dirt on his political rival and the White House sought to cover it up. The three panels leading the probe have already issued subpoenas to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Giuliani, in addition to Friday's White House subpoena.

Kamala Harris in the 2020 presidential race, the California Democrat has slid from an enviable front-runner position in her home state into the single digits in a new poll of likely voters in the Golden State.

As the state's March 5 primary draws closer, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (23%), former Vice President Joe Biden (22%) and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont (21%) are now tied as the leaders in the field among likely voters who are either registered as Democrats or identify as Democratic-leaning independents in the new Public Policy Institute of California poll, which was conducted in mid- to late September after Harris' uneven performance in the last debate.

Harris tumbled from 19% in July to 8% in the new poll by the institute, failing to sustain the momentum she sparked with her first debate performance in June. She lost significant ground over the summer, while her chief rivals all solidified their standing among California voters.

In the July poll, Warren was at 15%, Sanders was at 12% and Biden was at 11% -- all trailing Harris, who got both a fundraising and a polling bounce after she delivered a fiery performance in the first debate in Miami by questioning the former vice president's past opposition to busing for the purpose of desegregating schools.

While it is often said that California tends to reflect the national state of play of the presidential race -- because it is so expensive to wage an intensive campaign in this vast and diverse state -- the new Public Policy Institute of California poll underscores that Harris does not seem to be drawing any advantage from the fact that she served as the state's attorney general and continues to serve constituents as the state's junior US senator.

The talking points don't appear to defend the President's behavior on a call flagged in a whistleblower complaint that is now at the center of the impeachment inquiry, which indicated that Trump asked Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's family over baseless corruption claims.

The talking points also do not address the text messages released on Thursday between US diplomats and a senior Ukrainian aide showing how a potential Ukrainian investigation into the 2016 election was linked to a desired meeting between Zelensky and Trump.

Though the RNC talking points hit at the credibility of the whistleblower, the whistleblower's allegations have, so far, matched what intelligence officials have found.

In addition, the talking points do not address new reporting indicating that Trump similarly talked about Biden and another presidential rival, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, on a June 18 call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. He raised their political prospects, according to two people familiar with the discussion. In that call, Trump also told Xi he would remain quiet on Hong Kong protests as trade talks progressed

Among the talking points is the point that Democrats are refusing to hold an impeachment inquiry vote on the House floor, a point made in recent days from high-profile Republican lawmakers. The full House voted to authorize impeachment inquiries for Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.

But Democrats say there's nothing in the rules or the Constitution requiring such a vote, and the current House rules give the committees the tools they need already to conduct an inquiry, like subpoena power.

Pelosi reiterated that defense in a letter responding to a similar request by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Thursday afternoon. She also said she hopes McCarthy and other GOP members ""share our commitment to following the facts, upholding the Constitution, protecting our national security, and defending the integrity of our elections at such a serious moment in our nation's history.""

RNC spokesman Steve Guest told CNN in a statement Friday afternoon, ""As we have reiterated multiple times in multiple ways, President Trump did nothing wrong.""

This comes as White House officials are developing their own impeachment strategy.

Trump on Friday insisted that there was no quid pro quo in his dealings with Ukraine, despite the material in the newly released text messages. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump was asked about the text messages. He claimed he didn't know the ambassadors involved in the messaging. He repeated there was no quid pro quo, but said he would continue asking foreign countries for help investigating corruption.

White House officials have been largely sidelined as the President and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani take command of the anti-impeachment narrative, at times driving the news cycle in ways White House allies believe hurt the President's case -- or, at a minimum, make his position harder to defend -- administration officials and sources close to the White House said.

But inside the White House, officials have begun to ""unwind"" the timeline and circumstances surrounding the President's call with Zelensky, one White House official said.

The goal, according to the official, is to ensure the White House has a full picture of the events in hand as it fields inquiries from Congress and prepares to build the President's defense to impeachment. The effort has involved lawyers in the White House counsel's office and Situation Room staff who are involved in connecting the President with foreign leaders and compiling a record of those calls.

Also, Trump and top officials, including his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, have dismissed the need for a war room to bolster the White House's response to Democrats' impeachment inquiry, as President Bill Clinton's White House established when he faced impeachment.

Officials said Mulvaney and Kushner are the officials most focused on developing an impeachment strategy.

(CNN) President Donald Trump is betting that Americans will become so accustomed to his transgressions that they will become immune to outrage; that they will inoculate him against impeachment.

That may be why on Thursday he made a calculated tactical move. He c onfessed to asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden, and he publicly doubled down, urging yet another foreign government to interfere in US democracy. He suggested that China should investigate Biden, one of his leading opponents in the 2020 presidential election. (There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden in Ukraine. There's also no evidence that the former vice president received any money from China.)

But let's not confuse calculated and tactical with brilliant or clever. The move is part of Trump's ""stable genius"" playbook. Imagine confessing to an egregious abuse of power as a strategy for victory.

We know this was a planned maneuver because less than 24 hours earlier Trump was asked a question on the issue of Ukraine and he flailed awkwardly in front of a global audience. He was standing next to the visiting president of Finland, when Reuters reporter Jeff Mason insisted he answer, ""What do you or what did you want [Ukraine's] President Zelensky to do with regard to Joe and Hunter Biden?""

It was an embarrassing spectacle. The world took notice remarking on his startling behavior, as Trump irascibly demanded that Mason move on to questioning the Finnish president.

But Wednesday morning, Trump came armed with his response. Shouting answers to shouted questions in the shadow of the helicopter on the White House lawn, the President copped to what many experts say is an impeachable offense -- using his office for political gain -- and then committed yet another such offense. But the second one was much worse than the one that already triggered an impeachment inquiry.

""What exactly did you hope Zelensky would do about the Bidens?"" asked a reporter. Trump responded, ""They should investigate the Bidens,"" immediately adding, ""Likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens.""

Only moments earlier, the President had noted that Chinese officials are headed to the United States next week for negotiations on the costly trade war that Trump has launched against China. He said: ""if they don't do what we want, we have tremendous, tremendous power.""

It recalled his request of a ""favor"" from the Ukrainian president—captured in a rough transcript of a phone call between Trump and Zelensky. Trump raised this ""favor""-- that Ukraine investigate Biden, just after Zelensky said he wanted to buy more Javelin missiles to defend against Russian-armed insurgents.

It was a reprisal of his 2016 call for Russian help , essentially ""China, if you're listening...""

This time, Chinese officials listening to Trump might surmise that obtaining a favorable trade deal with the United States may require helping the President win the election.

This time, Trump was asking not a friendly country, but a top geopolitical foe of the United States to interfere in America's elections, an even more jaw-dropping affront to the responsible conduct of US foreign policy.

This time, the White House didn't need to lock the transcript in a super-secure electronic system, as it did with the transcript of the Ukraine call. This time it was all out in the open.

When asked if he had talked about this with his Chinese counterpart, Trump appeared to issue a threat. ""I'm sure President Xi does not like being under that kind of scrutiny..."" he said , as he went on to spread more calumnies and innuendos about Biden.

Now we hear that Trump raised the matter with the Chinese president. In a call with Xi on June 18, according to CNN sources, Trump brought up Biden and Elizabeth Warren, his two leading contenders. The call was reportedly stored in the same ultra-secure server where the call with Ukraine's president was locked away.

If the Ukraine call is grounds for impeachment, we're going to need a bigger impeachment boat.

Why is Trump incriminating himself? The reasons are many. First, this strategy of smearing his opponent in conspiracy theories and enlisting the support of foreign governments worked well for him against Hillary Clinton in 2016, and back then he didn't have access to all the elements of power he possesses as president.

Second, Trump may believe that by speaking openly about what he has done, it will look like it's nothing to be ashamed of, perfectly normal, instead of an astonishing abuse of power and violation of his oath of office.

And third, Trump thinks he is invincible. This was yet another instance of unrestrained hubris; another case of him figuratively shooting someone on 5th Avenue , which, as he told us before, he thinks would not cost him a single vote.

Trump added even more wild conspiracy theories as the day progressed, fulminating against the ""impeachment crap,"" and suggesting without any evidence that the pharmaceutical industry is behind the impeachment inquiry.

Just like the media’s phony Australia freak-out earlier this week, on Thursday, the fake news media hit us with round after round of sound and fury signifying nothing.

As the Ukraine Hoax loses steam, as those of us keeping our heads discover that the Democrats’ decision to cock the impeachment gun before seeing the transcript of the Ukraine call is turning into one of the greatest political blunders since John McCain canceled his presidential campaign to save the economy, the fake news media are hoping to cover up this pratfall with empty hysteria.

Let’s take Thursday’s examples one-by-one, starting with the stupidest first…

Chuck Todd’s Face Melts Because the Constitution, or Something…

Like a 12-year-old girl who just saw a mouse, Todd ran around screaming about democracy n’ stuff with this hysterical and hysterically funny monologue:

I don’t say this lightly. Let’s be frank, a national nightmare is upon us. The basic rules of our democracy are under attack from the president. We begin tonight with a series of admissions by the president that all but ensure his impeachment in the House of Representatives. It’s a moment of truth for Republicans, and they have been largely silent on what we have seen from the president. Today he publicly called on two foreign governments to interfere in the presidential election by investigating his chief 2020 political rival.

Todd’s opener is a flat-out lie. He doesn’t “take this lightly?” What are we, idiots…? These left-wing liars claim our “democracy is under attack” every time a Republican defends himself, and they’ve been saying this about Trump for four years now!

Second verse, same as the first…

Seriously, fuck off.

Trump Spoke to China About Joe Biden!!!

Here’s far-left CNN’s big, fat, fake headline… “Trump raised Biden with Xi in June call housed in highly secure server.”

What’s especially hilarious about this particular piece of propaganda (sorry, I don’t link fake news) is that it took five — five! — so-called reporters to gin up this nonsense.

But do you see what’s going on here? The headline is designed to 1) give us the impression Trump did a quid pro quo with China to investigate a political rival, and 2) then engaged in a “cover up” by hiding the call in this secure server.

Except for the fact that nothing close to that is true, this is really big news!

Here’s what actually happened on this call, which is only revealed after three paragraphs of CNN’s spin:

During a phone call with Xi on June 18, Trump raised Biden’s political prospects as well as those of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who by then had started rising in the polls, according to two people familiar with the discussion. In that call, Trump also told Xi he would remain quiet on Hong Kong protests as trade talks progressed.

So all Trump did was shoot the breeze.

As far as this super-secret server that we’re supposed to believe covers up all of Trump’s impeachable offenses goes… Obama used the same server for his calls.

So once again, you have the fake news media dressing up a non-story, a big zero into a BOMBSHELL.

The Texts! The Texts! The Texts Smoke Like a Gun!

ADDED: We now know that the Taylor’s text lamenting how it’s “crazy to withhold security assistance” was prompted by a Politico article, not something going on in the White House. So this BOMBSHELL is even dumber than I originally believed.

Far-left ABC News, which has already poured Ukrainian fake news over itself and lit itself on fire, hit us with this latest BOMBSHELL: “‘Crazy to withhold security assistance’ to Ukraine for political campaign: Top US diplomat.” (Sorry again, but I don’t link fake news.)

Oh, boy, they got Drumpf now!

The walls are really closing in this time!

Except, not.

The full context of the text messages are what you call … exculpatory. Here’s some real journalism courtesy of Breitbart News:

Newly disclosed text messages show Gordon Sondland, the United States Ambassador to the European Union, defended President Donald Trump’s July 25 telephone call with the leader of Ukraine, affirming the president has said “no quid pro quo of any kind” took place between the heads of state, according to a report. On Thursday, ABC News published excerpts of the texts in which Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, wrote to Sondland, “I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,” seemingly a reference to allegations brought forward by a partisan CIA officer in a complaint that stated the president sought to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the business ties of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President and 2020 White House hopeful Joe Biden.

More:

“I believe you are incorrect about President Trump’s intentions,” Sondland wrote in a message to Taylor. “The president has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo of any kind. The president is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during the campaign.”

What’s more, according to NUMEROUS reports, Ukraine did not 1) feel pressured at all, and 2) was expecting the U.S. aid to continue at the time of the call.

Republicans BREAK WITH TRUMP on Whistleblower!!

OMFG, Republicans are BREAKING WITH Trump!

He’s doomed!

His presidency is DOOMED!

Except, yeah, no… NBC News is gonna NBC News.

All Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) said was, “Whistleblowers should be protected. I stand with Chuck Grassley on this. We have laws in place.”

That’s not “breaking with” Trump.

Buried in the story is the following: “Ernst, who’s facing re-election next year, said last week she wasn’t concerned about the substance of the call. ‘I’ve looked at the transcript; I don’t see anything there,'” she said at a town hall event.

So no one is “breaking with” Trump.

Man alive.

—

With the Ukraine Hoax coming apart like a cheap sweater, this is how the media believe they can cover that fact up, by making up scandals out of whole cloth, out of hyperbolic monologues and headlines that don’t hold up to what little factual reporting there is buried underneath the phony headline.

They got nothing.

They know they got nothing.

But they believe they can fool voters by holding up a banana and screaming about it being a smoking gun.

The former Texas congressman and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate characterized Buttigieg's position as driven by political calculation.

""I was really offended by those comments,"" O'Rourke told reporters after a gun control policy forum in Las Vegas on Wednesday. ""And I think he represents a kind of politics that is focused on poll-testing and focus-group-driving and triangulating and listening to consultants, before you arrive at a position.""

O'Rourke's comments came after Buttigieg took an implicit swipe at O'Rourke -- as well as New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who was the first 2020 presidential candidate to support mandatory buy-backs -- on Wednesday.

He called mandatory buy-backs ""a shiny object makes it harder for us to focus"" on reforms that are more politically viable in Washington, where any new gun control measures would require Republican support given the GOP's Senate majority.

""As a policy, it's had mixed results,"" Buttigieg said. ""It's a healthy debate to have, but we've got to do something now.""

Mandatory buybacks are a dividing issue for the 2020 Democratic field at large. But O'Rourke's direct and personal rebuke of Buttigieg forced into the open a tension that has brewed for months between the two camps and their supporters. The two entered the race in the same lane: Both as generation-change candidates with viral appeal, both vying to be seen as alternatives to former Vice President Joe Biden.

O'Rourke's allies have been bitter about Buttigieg since early April, when he said in New Hampshire -- in a clear poke at O'Rourke -- that ""I hear the way you ingratiate yourself to voters is to stand on things.""

Both have lost altitude in recent months, though Buttigieg has remained a much stronger fundraiser and is ahead of O'Rourke in nearly all polls.

But the divide over mandatory buy-backs has offered the clearest view yet of their diverging approaches to politics -- with Buttigieg seeking to show he is able to stake out a sober middle ground and could function effectively in Washington, and O'Rourke relying on more emotional appeals to those wishing to shake up the political system.

Ongoing clash

Buttigieg often uses the term ""shiny object"" to describe something he views as a distraction. Shortly after his appearance at Wednesday's forum, Buttigieg was asked whether he would allow his hypothetical vice president's son or daughter to serve on a foreign board.

He responded by saying Trump is trying to ""change the subject"" away from his ""abuse of power.""

""Let's deal with that and not get caught in the shiny objects he's going to throw out,"" Buttigieg said.

But the mayor calling O'Rourke's signature gun proposal a ""shiny object"" set off the Texas Democrat and his campaign.

The two had already clashed in September , when Buttigieg said O'Rourke's push for mandatory buy-backs -- which he has called for in the wake of a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, Texas -- played into the hands of Republicans looking for reasons to back away from gun control measures at a time when Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell were ""at least pretending to be open to reforms.""

But the Las Vegas forum marked a clear escalation from O'Rourke.

After pointing to Buttigieg's comments, O'Rourke asked, ""How in the world can you say that to March For Our Lives,"" referring to the student-led group founded in the wake of last year's school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that co-hosted Wednesday's forum.

""How can you say that to survivors of mass shootings across this country? How can you say that to the majority of Hispanics in America, certainly in Texas, who fear that they will be the victims of a mass shooting inspired by racism, hatred, that's been welcomed into the open by this president, and has been armed with weapons of war?"" he said.

O'Rourke lashed out again in a text message conversation with BuzzFeed , saying that Buttigieg's comment was ""offensive to anyone who has been shot by one of these weapons or who fears being shot or has lost someone to an AR-15 or AK-47.""

For his part, Buttigieg on Wednesday laid out a more modest set of proposals broadly backed by the field of Democratic 2020 presidential contenders: closing loopholes that allow some guns to be sold without background checks; allowing states to adopt ""red flag"" laws that allow families or police to ask a judge to have a potentially dangerous person's guns taken away; and banning the sale of additional assault-style rifles.

""We can get background checks done now. We can get red flag laws done now. We can get something done about the new sale of assault weapons now. We cannot wait for these other debates to play out -- even if they're healthy debates -- to get that action done because lives are on the line,"" Buttigieg said.

Vying for the top tier

In the Democratic primary field, Booker was the first to call for mandatory buy-backs. O'Rourke announced his support in early August -- after the El Paso shooting -- and California Sen. Kamala Harris called it a ""good idea"" in early September.

However, Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden have opposed mandatory buy-backs. Biden instead this week proposed that owners of assault-style rifles be required to participate in an optional buy-back or register them with the government under the same law that strictly regulated machine guns in the wake of the gangland shootings of the early 1920s and '30s.

But what's striking about the O'Rourke-Buttigieg clash is that both are coming from a similar starting point: They are vying to vault into the top tier of a Democratic presidential race currently being dominated by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Buttigieg has positioned himself as a generational-change candidate with Midwest roots -- but also as a more moderate alternative to the party's most progressive candidates.

O'Rourke had offered similar appeal, with a Sun Belt bent. But his campaign changed direction in the wake of the El Paso shooting.

Previously O'Rourke had opposed mandatory buy-backs, saying as a Senate candidate in 2018 that he would not support taking away Americans' guns.

""To be clear, they should have them. If you purchased that AR-15, you own it, keep it. Continue to use it responsibly,"" O'Rourke said during that race.

But he said the shooting in his hometown had changed him.

""I know that this is not politically easy. It's frankly why far too few people have proposed it; it's frankly why I have not proposed it in the past,"" O'Rourke told CNN in El Paso in August, explaining his reversal. ""I've said, 'This is something we should consider, I want to think about it, I want to talk to people about it.' I've thought about it. I've talked to people. ... And now, beyond a shadow of a doubt, regardless of what it does to our prospects going forward, you've got to speak the truth and be clear about where the solutions are.""

He made headlines in the September Democratic presidential debate when he said that ""hell yes,"" he would take AR-15s and AK-47s away from their owners.

That drew a rebuke from Booker, who already supported mandatory buy-backs -- as well as a national gun licensing program. Booker again criticized O'Rourke on Wednesday in Las Vegas.

""He saw the horrors visiting his community,"" Booker said of O'Rourke's reversal on the issue. ""Are we going to have to wait until hell's lottery comes to your community? No, we are a better country.""

O'Rourke responded on stage that he wanted to give Booker ""all the credit in the world for being a leader on this.""

""So Cory's deal is, you know, he's trying to determine who got to which policy position first,"" O'Rourke told reporters afterward. ""My response to that is, we're both in the right place on this and so let's work together."""

“.@RenoAirport Authority apologizes to @ewarren for the group of protestors on 10/2 in violation of airport policies. Airport Police weren’t given prior notice of the arrival,” it said in a tweet.

During a campaign event, Warren was asked by a reporter whether Twitter should ban Trump, to which she responded with a one-word answer: “no.”

This puts the Masachussetts senator at odds with competing Democrat presidential candidate Kamala Harris, who said that Twitter should ban the President because of his commentary on the alleged “whistleblower.”

“He has used his platform, president of the United States, in a way that’s been about inciting fear,” said Harris earlier this week.

Tulsi Gabbard was the first Democrat candidate to break with Harris, promising to “stand up for every American’s right and freedom of speech, no matter how strongly I may disagree with that speech. This freedom is the First Amendment of the Constitution for a reason and I will do all I can to stand up for it.”

Gabbard has previously called out Silicon Valley for political censorship, even filing a lawsuit against tech giant Google over alleged censorship of her campaign ads. She has also called the dominance of big tech over public discourse a “threat to free speech, fair elections, and our democracy.”

Warren’s statements have been more contradictory. While she has disagreed with Harris on Twitter banning Trump, and once condemned Facebook for its power to “shut down debate” after it removed an ad for her campaign in March this year, she has also called for Twitter to censor allegedly “racist” criticism of Kamala Harris."

Warren’s third-quarter fundraising haul is a $5.5 million increase from the $19.1 million she raised in the second quarter. She has prided her campaign on being 100 percent grassroots-funded, although she reportedly used $10.4 million in leftover funds from her 2018 Senate campaign to cushion her presidential bid. Warren happily courted big donors and attended fundraisers during her 2018 senatorial bid.

Biden’s campaign announced on Thursday it only raised $15.2 million in the third quarter, significantly less than expected. The sum was less than what was raised by competitors polling below Biden, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg — who raised $25.3 million and $19.1 million, respectively, in the same period.

Although Biden’s total was also less than the $21.5 million he raised in the second quarter, his campaign attempted to put a positive spin on the fundraising numbers. In a statement provided to the press announcing the fundraising haul, Biden’s team claimed that “98 percent of all donations were from grassroots donors” and 56 percent of all contributors were new.

“Today’s fundraising totals put the campaign in a strong position as we enter the fall. The question any campaign faces at this point is whether or not you have the resources to compete in early states and sustain your efforts beyond,” said Greg Schultz, the former vice president’s campaign manager. “Our campaign unequivocally does and builds on our strength each week.”

Despite the campaign’s positive spin, the fundraising numbers underscore Biden’s declining position in the 2020 contest. When the former vice president first announced his campaign in late April, he was seen as the frontrunner for the nomination, a fact confirmed by his domination in the polls and strong fundraising. Since that time, however, Biden’s campaign has been battered by persistent gaffes and ethical questions surrounding his son’s business dealings in Ukraine and China.

All of this has impacted the former vice president’s standing with the Democrat electorate. A slew of recent polls has shown Biden either trailing or tied with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in the first three early voting states of New Hampshire, Iowa, and Nevada. Likewise, Biden has lost his advantage nationally, trailing Warren by as many as six percentage points in a recent survey conducted for the Economist."

Avenatti filed the lien claim on Thursday in Columbus, Ohio, just days after the adult film actress reached a $450,000 settlement with the city regarding an incident last year when she was arrested on suspicion of inappropriately touching an undercover officer. However, the city attorney’s office dropped the charges within hours of the initial event, according to a Fox News report.

Thursday’s court filing stated:

Despite repeated demands that Ms. Daniels fulfill her contractual obligations and pay for the millions of dollars in legal fees and costs she has enjoyed for her benefit over the last approximate 19 months, including in this case, she has refused. Instead, Ms. Daniels maintains that because she is a ‘celebrity,’ she is entitled to free legal services and costs, and when confronted with her repeated failure to pay, she believes that she is entitled to manufacture and fabricate facts designed to impugn the reputation of her counsel and falsely accuse him of a multitude of acts. But the law does not work the way Ms. Daniels wishes. Avenatti’s attorney, Tom Warren, reportedly said his client did great work for Daniels, all while “under intense pressure and scrutiny.” “He made significant personal sacrifices for her benefit. He deserves to be paid by her, not criticized,” Warren concluded.

On May 22, Breitbart News reported Avenatti was charged for defrauding the porn star after federal prosecutors in New York City said he “used a doctored document to divert about $300,000 that Daniels was supposed to get from a book deal, then used the money for personal and business expenses.”

However, prosecutors claimed only half of the money was repaid.

Once the charges were announced, Avenatti defended himself on Twitter by stating, “No monies relating to Ms. Daniels were ever misappropriated or mishandled. She received millions of dollars worth of legal services and we spent huge sums in expenses. She directly paid only $100.00 for all that she received.”

“I look forward to a jury hearing the evidence,” he concluded."

Kamala Harris (D-CA) is shifting her campaign strategy and focusing on Iowa, going as far as preparing “Sunday suppers” for families in the Hawkeye State in hopes of recruiting supporters.

The Harris campaign is touting a new facet of her Iowa swing, dubbed the “I feel your pain” tour. It features a series of more “intimate” meetings with families in the early caucus state, designed to show a different side of the California senator. The tour follows contentious Democrat debates, in which Harris’s competitors — namely, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) — highlighted less-than-flattering aspects of Harris’s prosecutorial record.

A Harris adviser spoke to Politico and suggested that the tour is about isolating issues that affect families day-to-day:

“It’s not about, ‘Let me talk about myself,” a Harris adviser involved in the planning told POLITICO. “It’s, ‘I understand your problems on a human level in a way that you experience them.’ Their concern is not, ‘I need broad systemic overhauls,’ it’s, ‘I can’t get a job, or I can’t pay the bills this month, or I can’t pay my student loans, or my yard is flooded.’” “You have a fundamentally different conversation when you’re sitting around someone’s kitchen table in their home,” the adviser added.

Additionally, Harris plans to “help prepare Sunday suppers in peoples’ homes.”

She also has bigger events planned across the state as well, including a meeting with Moms Demand Action and Women for Kamala events with field organizers.

Harris’s Iowa blitz follows the presidential candidate’s declaration that she is “f*cking moving to Iowa.”

A reporter overheard the remark as Harris expressed her strategy to a colleague:

“I’m f****** moving to Iowa,” Sen. Kamala Harris joked to Sen. Hirono (before she noticed me) pic.twitter.com/dv0PRWLY8g — Matt Laslo (@MattLaslo) September 18, 2019

The Harris campaign tried to embrace the “oops” moment with a dash of levity:

Harris continues to face an uphill battle in national polls, failing to recapture her once-held top tier status. The most recent Economist/YouGov poll shows Harris in fifth place with just five percent support. Similarly, a Monmouth University Poll released Wednesday shows the California lawmaker tied with Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) in fifth place, with five percent support each.

Harris has a long way to go in Iowa, according to the current Real Clear Politics average. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Joe Biden (D), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Buttigieg are leading in Iowa with 23 percent, 20.3 percent, 12 percent, 11.3 percent, respectively. Harris is in fifth place with 5.3 percent support."

The most important finding in this poll is the following: “Democrats are only consolidating their own base” with respect to impeachment.

That is exactly right, and that is what we are seeing in every poll gauging impeachment. The elite media headlines scream, “Support for Impeachment Rises!” Yeah, to 44 percent or 46 percent, which means only Democrats are on board.

So what?

The NRCC poll found that in battleground congressional districts, meaning the districts that will be up for grabs in 2020, that “Two-thirds (63%) of voters in NRCC target seats and 66% of voters in Republican-held battleground seats agree that Democrats in Congress are too obsessed with impeaching the President[.]”

What voters would prefer, according to the poll, is a Congress “working on issues they campaign on such as funding our military, improving the nation’s infrastructure, lowering the cost of prescription drugs, and caring for our nation’s veterans.”

In worse news for Democrats, “the top priority for voters in NRCC target seats is immigration and in Republican-held battleground seats is the economy.”

The NRCC found six separate issues, “that reach double digit importance for voters and Democrats aren’t focusing on any of them.”

On the overall issue of impeachment, the NRCC numbers align with the polls we are seeing from the media, polls that once again show nothing more than the Democrats consolidating their base of support on the issue.

“In NRCC target seats, voters oppose impeachment: 44% support – 47% oppose. In Republican-held battleground seats voters oppose impeachment: 46%-49%.”

What’s more, in these target districts, 51 percent of Independents oppose impeachment and 46 percent of “voters in NRCC target seats are less likely to vote for a candidate for congress who supports impeachment.”

Feel free to write the poll off as partisan, but as I mentioned above, it aligns perfectly with the media’s impeachment polls and analysis from the Wall Street Journal, which is no fan of Trump:

There is no position Democratic Rep. Kendra Horn can take on impeaching President Trump that will satisfy a majority of voters in the district she narrowly won last year, which Mr. Trump won by nearly 14 points. Republicans say the House probe, which was designated an impeachment investigation last week, is a baseless attempt to undo the 2016 election. They dismiss Ms. Horn’s technical objection to the impeachment label—she is among roughly 10 House Democrats to do so—as politically transparent. Some Democrats, meanwhile, want her to align with progressives and back impeachment, while others want to avoid a battle that could prove costly to taxpayers. … Ms. Horn beat a Republican incumbent last year by about 3,000 votes in a district that wasn’t on Democrats’ radar because of Mr. Trump’s margin of victory in 2016. Speaking after a town hall Monday, she called “irresponsible” her colleagues’ decision to move toward impeachment without a full investigation beyond the release of the transcript of the president’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and whistleblower complaint.

Democrats are also facing opposition to impeachment through anti-impeachment protesters, and some of those Democrats, like Rep. Lucy McBath (D-GA), are not handling the unexpected blowback very well. Her office dialed 911 on the protesters and had them removed by police.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), the current frontrunner for the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination, also got a taste of the protests.

Alexis Pelosi, the speaker’s youngest daughter, and her cousin, Laurence, were on the host committee for a fundraiser hosted on the former vice president’s behalf at the home of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) in San Francisco, California. Biden was in attendance for the event, which was one of three his campaign had scheduled in the Bay Area on Thursday.

Neither Alexis nor Laurence Pelosi’s attendance at the Biden fundraiser is surprising. Alexis, a documentary filmmaker and journalist, has been cultivating a more liberal profile herself in Hollywood and Washington, DC. Although less overtly political than her mother, her work behind the camera has taken a more ideological turn recently. Two of her better-known documentaries in the past decade have focused on the issues of immigration and the impact large donors have on America’s political system.

The shift has been noticeable in her campaign donations. Apart from one donation to the House Democrats PAC in 2002, the younger Pelosi made no political contributions until 2016 when she donated to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s failed presidential campaign. Since then, she has donated to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and made several smaller contributions to progressive candidates and causes. Alexis donated $1,000 to Biden’s campaign on April 25, the day he announced his candidacy.

Laurence, on the other hand, as the founder of an investment firm specializing in real estate, is lesser-known among the public. He has, however, been contributing to Democrat candidates and causes since at least 1993. Like his cousin, Laurence also donated $1,000 to Biden’s campaign on the day of the former vice president’s announcement. It is unclear if either has donated further to Biden, as the Federal Election Commission (FEC) has yet to make records available for the third quarter of this year.

Even though the Pelosis attendance at a fundraiser on Biden’s behalf is not remarkable, the same cannot be said of the timing. The fundraiser comes less than two weeks after Nancy Pelosi launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump’s conduct with Ukraine. The act, which is the first step in the process of bringing charges against the president, was in response to Trump’s suggestion that the Ukrainian government probe into Hunter Biden’s business dealings in the country. In particular, Trump and others have noted the younger Biden profited from opportunities that were unavailable to ordinary businessmen and seemed to directly intersect with his father’s political influence.

At the center of the controversy is how Hunter Biden secured an appointment to the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian oil and natural gas giant, in 2014. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden secured the position, which paid as much as $83,000 per month, despite having no background in the energy industry or Ukraine.

The younger Biden’s lack of experience, coupled with the fact that his father had just been made the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine, immediately raised questions from ethics watchdogs in both the U.S. and Europe about a conflict of interest. Furthering the ethical cloud over the appointment is that this came during the same month that Mykola Zlochevsky, Burisma’s founder, had his assets seized in the United Kingdom for suspicion of money laundering. Some have speculated Hunter Biden’s ascension to Burisma’s board was an attempt by Zlochevsky to curry favor with western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of his business dealings.

A brazen attempt along such lines would not be totally ill-suited for Zlochevsky. The Burisma founder is rumored to be one of eastern Europe’s top oligarchs, a position obtained while serving in the Ukrainian government under former President Viktor Yanukovych — a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was during his tenure in government as Ukraine’s minister of natural resources that Burisma received its oil and gas licenses–inappropriately, many suspect.

It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky’s legal troubles that Joe Biden’s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Biden, who has publicly bragged about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor’s ability to tackle corruption.

Unofficially, though, it was well known Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster, he was warned to back off of the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin’s successor dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky, allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having fled it in 2014.

Despite the strong implications of conflicts of interest and wrongdoing, Nancy Pelosi chose to ignore the storied history of the Biden family’s affairs in Ukraine before choosing to launch her impeachment inquiry. In fact, the rush in which the speaker and her allies in the Democrat leadership moved to launch an inquiry has drawn accusations from President Trump that the entire proceeding is a “witch hunt.” Republicans in Congress have echoed the sentiment, noting the speaker chose to ignore precedent by refusing to hold a vote on the impeachment inquiry, and her deputies, such as Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), have threatened to charge White House officials with obstruction of justice if they “stonewall” the probe.

For her part, the speaker has done nothing to shield herself from such criticism and accusations. One day prior to her daughter and nephew attending a fundraiser for Biden, Nancy Pelosi declared during an appearance on ABC News that the “re-election of Donald Trump would do irreparable damage to the United States.”

Representatives for Pelosi did not return requests for comment on this story.

Outside of the immediate impeachment circumstances, the fundraiser also poses questions regarding the speaker’s preference in the race for the 2020 Democrat nomination. Even though Pelosi has made no official endorsement, the fact that her daughter and nephew are backing Biden raises the question if she herself is in the former vice president’s corner.

A review of FEC filings shows that no other member of the speaker’s family has donated to a candidate other than Biden, even though recent polling has shown Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) leads in their home state of California."

Forty-five Republicans have joined the resolution, sponsored by House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs (R-AZ), to condemn Schiff for retelling a fabricated conversation between Trump and Zelensky. Biggs sponsored H. Res. 604, and it quickly gained support throughout the House Republican conference.

When Biggs sponsored the bill, he said that Schiff’s stunt was “inexcusable” to “mislead the American public with such a statement.”

Although a public list of cosponsors only shows 18 Republicans supporting the resolution, an internal GOP list obtained by Breitbart News shows that 45 Republicans have joined the list of GOP lawmakers to condemn Schiff. This represents a growing movement of Republicans to fight back against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) and Democrats’ move to impeach Trump.

Republicans have quickly mounted an offensive against Schiff and his misrepresentation of the conversation between Trump and Zelensky.

Keller announced Thursday that he will join a growing list of Republicans planning to condemn House Intelligence Committee Chairman Schiff for retelling a fabricated conversation between Trump and Zelensky.

Keller said that Schiff has led a “rigged political witch hunt” and that Republicans must hold him accountable. The Pennsylvania conservative said:

We now know what we’ve suspected all along: the ‘impeachment inquiry’ being undertaken by Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Schiff, and the socialist House Democrats is nothing short of a rigged political witch hunt that seeks to delegitimize our duly-elected President. Chairman Schiff has made a mockery of this solemn process and the Democrats leading the impeachment charge have strayed far afield of the Constitutional impeachment parameters. Their continued pursuit of impeachment is wrong, the nonsense must stop, and Chairman Schiff should be held accountable for his actions both prior to the committee’s hearing last week as well as during. It’s time to stop with the litigating and investigating and return to legislating for the benefit of the American people.

House Republican Leader McCarthy said that Schiff is “desperate” to damage Trump.

“Chairman Adam Schiff has been lying to the American people for years.

Chairman Adam Schiff has been lying to the American people for years. Now he is so desperate to damage the president that he literally made up a false version of a phone call. Enough is enough. I have signed a resolution to censure Schiff in the House of Representatives. — Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) October 2, 2019

McCarthy said on Fox News Wednesday that not only should Schiff be censured, but that he should be removed from his chairmanship. McCarthy also slammed Schiff for not revealing that the intelligence officer “whistleblower” contacted a House Intelligence Committee staffer before filing his complaint with the intelligence community inspector general.

“He has no credibility to be a chairman; he has no right to be the prosecutor in this case,” McCarthy said."

The 34-year-old from Karachi looks after $12 million winning machine Enable , who is chasing a record third straight Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in Paris Sunday.

Shawani is head groom and work rider for Enable at the Newmarket stables of champion trainer John Gosden , whom he credits for teaching him everything he knows -- including the basics of how to ride a horse.

""The boss [Gosden], he's a gentleman, he's always looked after me very well. He was paying me full wages, and at that time I was absolutely useless. That's the truth,"" Shawani told CNN over the phone after finishing a day's work at Gosden's Clarehaven stables.

Imran Shawani (second from right) has worked for trainer John Gosden (right) for 14 years.

'Absolutely sh*t rider'

Imran joined Gosden's team 14 years ago after an introduction from his brother Anwar, who had formerly worked for another trainer in England, Mick Channon.

Seeing Imran on a horse for the first time, Gosden was not impressed.

""The boss said, 'Oh my God, you need to learn a lot,'"" he said.

""He used to teach me riding for one hour every day after third lot on the pony. He taught me how to hold to the reins, how to go up and down when the horse trots and how to stand on a horse when it canters.

""I was always doing some mistakes but the boss always ignore, ignore, ignore and he gave me lots of chance.

""I was an absolutely s**t rider.""

Imran Shawani holds Enable as Frankie Dettori celebrates after winning the Yorkshire Oaks in August.

'Luckiest person'

It was a steep learning curve, given he only knew a couple of people in the country and his English was rudimentary at best.

Once, Gosden enquired if a horse in Shawani's charge had been doing any coughing.

""I'd been told to always use sorry, thank you or excuse me. So I just said, 'Thank you,'"" he laughed.

Gosden had to demonstrate a cough -- and so Shawani's learning continued.

Another brother Afzal rode Enable's father Nathaniel, but when Imran chose her to look after early in her three-year-old season, little did he know she would go on to become a wonder horse.

Since then she has notched 12 straight wins including two Arcs, the Epsom Oaks, the Irish Oaks, two King George VI's at Ascot and the Breeders' Cup Turf , all in tandem with veteran Italian jockey Frankie Dettori.

Now, Shawani starts work at 5:30 a.m. every day to prepare Enable before riding out with her in training.

""She's beautiful, she knows she's a superstar,"" he added. ""If you take her on Warren Hill [Newmarket's gallops], she wants to show off she's Enable.

""I'm so proud because whenever she goes out for a canter everybody wants to see her and touch her.

""She's so special for everyone and if you give her a polo or a carrot she's going to be your friend.

""I think I am the luckiest person in the yard and in Newmarket.""

Of the upcoming Paris showdown, Shawani added: ""She's a tough horse, she's the best and she's in very good form.

""If she wins she's going to make history and be a world champion horse. Imagine what I'll feel. I'll leave it to you."""

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is vowing to implement a full open borders policy at the United States-Mexico border where border crossers and illegal aliens would rarely be detained.

Warren took to Twitter on Thursday to commit that she, as president, will not “unnecessarily” detain border crossers and illegal aliens who arrive at the southern border.

“Too many immigrants have died in ICE custody,” Warren said. “We need to ensure asylum seekers are welcomed, treated humanely, receive the medical care they need, and are not detained unnecessarily. I have a plan to rebuild a more humane immigration system.”

Too many immigrants have died in ICE custody. We need to ensure asylum seekers are welcomed, treated humanely, receive the medical care they need, and are not detained unnecessarily. I have a plan to rebuild a more humane immigration system. https://t.co/v3OZZHeGPd — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 3, 2019

Warren’s statement came in response to a report that a Cameroon national detained by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency had died while in custody. Unmentioned, though, is that migrant deaths under the Trump administration are 20 percent lower than the rate of migrant deaths under former President Obama.

The promise is just the latest remark where Warren has promoted the donor-class platform of hemispheric open borders between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, as well as Central and South America. The same position has been accepted by the billionaire Koch brothers donor network, failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and the big business lobby.

On Sunday, Warren told American union workers that increasing foreign competition against them in the labor market by giving amnesty to the roughly 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S. would be “good” for them.

“[Amnesty for all illegal aliens] is good for all workers, and we need to get them into our unions,” Warren said.

High levels of immigration, illegal and legal, put downward pressure on U.S. wages while redistributing about $500 billion in wealth away from America’s working and middle class and towards employers and new arrivals, research by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine has found.

Research by analyst Steven Camarotta has found that every one percent increase in the immigrant portion of American workers’ occupations reduces their weekly wages by about 0.5 percent. This means the average native-born American worker today has his weekly wages reduced by perhaps 8.5 percent because of current legal immigration levels.

While Warren seeks to increase foreign competition against American workers, President Trump has pursued policy initiatives to decrease foreign competition, increasing U.S. wages and giving American workers leverage over businesses.

Bernie Sanders' massive haul.",2019-10-04,CNN,"Elizabeth Warren raises $24.6 million in third quarter, reinforcing status among 2020 front-runners",https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/04/politics/elizabeth-warren-third-quarter-fundraising/index.html,"(CNN) Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren raised $24.6 million over the past three months, her campaign said Friday morning, falling just short of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' massive haul.

Warren's momentum in the polls, in which she has emerged as a front-runner alongside former Vice President Joe Biden, has been mirrored by a continued rise in small dollar fundraising. She brought in only $6 million during a disappointing first quarter, then jumped to $19.1 million in the second before a breakout summer that saw her outpace Biden by more than $9 million

Earlier in the week, Sanders announced a $25.3 million third quarter total, which set the pace for the 2020 Democratic field. Warren landed just shy of that number, but is well-positioned now to expand her campaign, which has $25.7 million in cash-on-hand, according to the campaign, as the first round of caucuses and primaries approach.

Campaign manager Roger Lau, in an email to supporters, said more than 500,000 people made more than 940,000 contributions to the campaign during the third quarter. The majority of those donors -- 300,000 -- gave to Warren for the first time during that period, Lau said, for an average contribution of $26. Since she entered the race on New Year's Eve, an estimated 750,000 people have given to Warren's campaign.

Warren's impressive total underscores the power of small dollar donors in the 2020 Democratic contest. Both she and Sanders have forsworn high-dollar fundraisers, but combined, they outraised Biden, California Sen. Kamala Harris and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, all of whom have tapped wealthy donors, by $4 million this quarter: $49.9 million to $45.9 million.

CNBC reports that during a livestreamed employee Q&A call this week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed a number of topics including politics. Zuckerberg was asked to respond to Senator Bernie Sanders’s comment that billionaires should not exist, and gave a surprising answer given that Zuckerberg himself is worth $69 billion.

“I understand where he’s coming from,” Zuckerberg said. “I don’t know that I have an exact threshold on what amount of money someone should have but on some level no one deserves to have that much money.”

Zuckerberg was also asked about comments he made during two separate leaked internal Q&A sessions he had with employees in July. Zuckerberg is quoted as saying: “You have someone like Elizabeth Warren that thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies … I mean, if she gets elected president then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.”

Zuckerberg adds: “And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don’t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. I mean, that’s not the position that you want to be in when you’re, you know, I mean … It’s like, we care about our country, and want to work with our government and do good things. But look, at the end of the day, if someone’s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and fight.”

Zuckerberg stated in the recent public Q&A that he stands by his comments about Warren but added: “let’s try not to antagonize her further.” Zuckerberg was also asked about how the firm determines what counts as fake news that should be removed, Zuckerberg clarified that the main objective is to stamp out “complete and obvious hoaxes.”

“When we talk about misinformation, a lot of people focus on a statement that isn’t clear if it’s a shade of true or partially false,” he said. “There’s a lot of stuff that people say that is completely false. That’s the thing that I’m really focused on and making sure that we [stop].”

The ad is geared to show a Democratic audience that Biden, who polls show battling Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont at the top of the polls, is the most electable candidate -- or at least the one Trump fears the most -- in the party's 2020 field.

It is also a response to the Trump campaign's ads in early states that include false claims about Biden, his son and Ukraine and hit Democrats for beginning impeachment proceedings over Trump's effort to pressure the Ukrainian President to investigate the Bidens. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden in Ukraine.

The Trump campaign is doing an ad blitz in the same four states starting this weekend, going after Biden. The Biden-focused ad buy totals more than $1 million, campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh confirmed to CNN. That buy is part of an overall $10 million buy from the campaign and Republican National Committee.

While Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) reported a beefy $25.3 million in the third quarter, Sen. Elizabeth Warren raised $24.6 million, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) reported $19.1 million, several candidates saw numbers relatively the same – or lower – than the Trump campaign and RNC’s three-day spike:

Joe Biden: $15.2 million

Andrew Yang (D): $10 million

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ): $6 million

Marianne Williamson (D): $3 million

Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO): $2.1 million

“The sudden flood of donations to President Trump’s reelection effort provides undeniable evidence that this impeachment gambit represents a massive miscalculation,” Parscale noted, arguing that the impeachment effort is “already coming apart at the seams.”

Parscale said Democrats are using the impeachment effort as a mass distraction, albeit one that is backfiring. He predicts it could pose an issue for vulnerable Democrats in swing districts and result in “serious losses” for Democrats, who desperately want to maintain a majority in the House.

He wrote:

If this week’s GOP fundraising haul is any indication, Pelosi didn’t just drive another nail into the coffin awaiting the Democrats’ nominee next year, she may also be looking at serious losses in the swing House districts that handed her the speaker’s gavel in 2018. The moderate Democrats in those seats are already being put on the spot by the impeachment push. Their Republican challengers are poised to hold them accountable back in their home districts, hoping to ensure that those freshman legislators find themselves out of office next year. The true toll of the Democrats’ decision to proceed with this Ukraine farce, of course, is the damage it is already inflicting on our government institutions. The American people won’t look kindly on their politicization of a process that exists as a last resort in a genuine crisis — which this clearly is not.

“We know that this charade won’t result in Donald Trump leaving office, but it may well result in many Democrats leaving theirs,” Parscale concluded.

Bernie is my senator, a fellow Vermonter. (Like most people around here, I call him Bernie.) I've been a supporter since he ran for mayor in Burlington some 30 years ago. In my view, no American politician has done more to advance progressive causes in the United States, pushing the Democrats from terrified middle-of-the-road positions on health care and economic inequality to a place we never dreamed we'd see in this lifetime.

He has spoken loudly for the poor, the disenfranchised. He was an early opponent of the Iraq War, unlike Joe Biden. He has a strong grasp of the existential threat posed by climate change.

But the heart attack is now a political problem — for him and the Democrats. It may not be possible for Bernie to continue pushing himself in the way he'd have to push himself to be nominated and to beat Donald Trump.

And beating Trump has become a national emergency. As recent weeks have shown, Trump is dangerously out of touch with reality, with no understanding of the constitutional separation of powers. Trump's behavior with regard to Ukraine (which is likely the tip of a proverbial iceberg) — and more blatantly, his invitation to China to interfere in America's election — makes it clear that he is willing to upend the democratic process itself, OUR democratic process, using his vast authority solely for his own, personal benefit.

The text messages, which were released by the House Intelligence Committee, underscore how Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was closely connected to US policy on Ukraine and was involved in setting up the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky, in which Trump also urged an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.

They show how cognizant the Ukrainians were about the importance of the election investigation to Trump and Giuliani's role.

On the morning of the call, in an exchange with a key adviser to the Ukrainian President, then-US Special Envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker made clear that it was important to the White House that Zelensky convince Trump that an investigation into the 2016 election would happen.

""Heard from the White House -- assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate/'get to the bottom of what happened' in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington,"" Volker said via text to the Ukrainian adviser on the morning of July 25.

Volker provided Congress with the text messages ahead of his closed-door congressional testimony on Thursday before three committees leading the House's impeachment inquiry into Trump and Ukraine.

The messages released by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee add a new layer of detail to the whistleblower complaint that prompted the impeachment inquiry, which alleged that Trump had urged the Ukrainian government to dig up dirt on his political rival, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.

That Trump wanted an investigation was a message that seemed to register with the Ukrainian administration. Volker and the Ukrainian adviser, Andrey Yermak, continued to text after the call about Zelensky making a public statement ahead of a meeting between the two leaders.

""I think potus really wants the deliverable,"" US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland texted Volker on August 9, as the two were talking about possible dates for a meeting.

""Once we have a date, will call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the US-UKRAINE relationship, including among other things Burisma and election meddling in investigations,"" Yermak wrote to Volker the following day.

Ukrainians drafted statement about starting investigation

A source familiar with the matter tells CNN that the Ukrainian government wrote the initial draft of a statement for public release, committing to pursue investigations of corruption.

The source told CNN that the Ukrainians drafted the statement to demonstrate to Trump and Giuliani, who they knew had influence with Trump, that there was a new team in Ukraine with Zelensky that was committed to cleaning up corruption.

The statement was shared with Volker and Sondland, who then shared it with Giuliani, according to the source. Giuliani told Volker that it did not go far enough and suggested inserting references to pursuing probes of Burisma and the 2016 election, although it did not mention the Bidens. Burisma is the Ukrainian company that hired Hunter Biden to be on its board.

Volker and Sondland then exchanged text messages about the draft, which Volker said he would share with an adviser to Zelensky. The Ukrainians told Volker they were not comfortable with the suggested statement, and the matter was ultimately dropped while a meeting between Zelensky and Trump continued to be pursued, the source said.

The source explained the context of the statement about the investigation after the discussion was included in the text messages provided to Congress ahead of Volker's testimony.

Giuliani told CNN after The New York Times first reported the existence of the statement that he ""never saw it or even draft of it.""

""This is their testimony if it is and not part of my role,"" he texted. ""They have to explain it. Lots of things going on I didn't know about.""

'it's crazy to withhold security assistance'

Ahead of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky, the text messages show how Giuliani was pushing for the call and for Zelensky to talk up the investigation.

""Had breakfast with Rudy this morning—teeing up call with Yermak Monday,"" Volker wrote to Sondland on July 19. ""Must have helped. Most (important) is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation—and address any specific personnel issues—if there are any.""

A rough transcript released by the White House shows that during the call, Trump repeatedly pushed Zelensky to investigate Biden, Trump's potential 2020 political rival, and his son.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.

Volker testified to the House committees Thursday that he had urged the Ukrainians not to interfere in US politics, and that the Ukrainians were concerned about the meeting being put on hold, according to two sources familiar with the testimony.

In August, it was publicly revealed that the Trump administration was holding up foreign aid to Ukraine, although the whistleblower complaint had not yet been made public.

Behind the scenes, concerns were being raised by a senior US diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, that the aid had been held up.

""Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?"" Taylor texted Sondland on September 1.

""Call me,"" Sondland responded. The context of Taylor's text message is not clear from the messages released by the committee.

A week later, Taylor was even more concerned, texting Sondland: ""As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.""

Sondland responded, ""Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.""

Sondland then suggested that if Taylor had additional concerns, he should reach out to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's assistant.

The demand for documents came in a letter Friday from House … [+866 chars]",House Democrats are seeking documents from Vice President Mike Pence as part of their impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump and his conversation with the President of Ukraine.,2019-10-04,CNN,House Democrats seek documents from Mike Pence for impeachment inquiry,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/04/politics/mike-pence-documents-impeachment/index.html,"(CNN) House Democrats on Friday issued a subpoena to the White House for documents related to Ukraine, ratcheting up the Democratic impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.

The subpoena came after the three committees leading the impeachment inquiry separately sent a letter Friday seeking documents from Vice President Mike Pence as part of their investigation into Trump and his conversation with the President of Ukraine.

The subpoena from House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings to the White House includes a request for a host of documents and communications tied to the President's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the holding up of foreign aid to Ukraine and efforts by Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his associates to push the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Joe Biden and Burisma, the company that hired Hunter Biden's son Hunter Biden to be on its board, according to a memo Cummings sent on the subpoena earlier this week.

""We deeply regret that President Trump has put us — and the nation — in this position, but his actions have left us with no choice but to issue this subpoena,"" Cummings of Maryland, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of California and House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel of New York wrote in a letter to the White House on Friday.

The subpoena escalates the Democratic impeachment investigation, which stems from the whistleblower complaint alleging Trump sought help from Ukraine's government to dig up dirt on his political rival and the White House sought to cover it up. The three panels leading the probe have already issued subpoenas to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Giuliani, in addition to Friday's White House subpoena.

The talking points don't appear to defend the President's behavior on a call flagged in a whistleblower complaint that is now at the center of the impeachment inquiry, which indicated that Trump asked Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's family over baseless corruption claims.

The talking points also do not address the text messages released on Thursday between US diplomats and a senior Ukrainian aide showing how a potential Ukrainian investigation into the 2016 election was linked to a desired meeting between Zelensky and Trump.

Though the RNC talking points hit at the credibility of the whistleblower, the whistleblower's allegations have, so far, matched what intelligence officials have found.

In addition, the talking points do not address new reporting indicating that Trump similarly talked about Biden and another presidential rival, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, on a June 18 call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. He raised their political prospects, according to two people familiar with the discussion. In that call, Trump also told Xi he would remain quiet on Hong Kong protests as trade talks progressed

Among the talking points is the point that Democrats are refusing to hold an impeachment inquiry vote on the House floor, a point made in recent days from high-profile Republican lawmakers. The full House voted to authorize impeachment inquiries for Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.

But Democrats say there's nothing in the rules or the Constitution requiring such a vote, and the current House rules give the committees the tools they need already to conduct an inquiry, like subpoena power.

Pelosi reiterated that defense in a letter responding to a similar request by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Thursday afternoon. She also said she hopes McCarthy and other GOP members ""share our commitment to following the facts, upholding the Constitution, protecting our national security, and defending the integrity of our elections at such a serious moment in our nation's history.""

RNC spokesman Steve Guest told CNN in a statement Friday afternoon, ""As we have reiterated multiple times in multiple ways, President Trump did nothing wrong.""

This comes as White House officials are developing their own impeachment strategy.

Trump on Friday insisted that there was no quid pro quo in his dealings with Ukraine, despite the material in the newly released text messages. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump was asked about the text messages. He claimed he didn't know the ambassadors involved in the messaging. He repeated there was no quid pro quo, but said he would continue asking foreign countries for help investigating corruption.

White House officials have been largely sidelined as the President and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani take command of the anti-impeachment narrative, at times driving the news cycle in ways White House allies believe hurt the President's case -- or, at a minimum, make his position harder to defend -- administration officials and sources close to the White House said.

But inside the White House, officials have begun to ""unwind"" the timeline and circumstances surrounding the President's call with Zelensky, one White House official said.

The goal, according to the official, is to ensure the White House has a full picture of the events in hand as it fields inquiries from Congress and prepares to build the President's defense to impeachment. The effort has involved lawyers in the White House counsel's office and Situation Room staff who are involved in connecting the President with foreign leaders and compiling a record of those calls.

Also, Trump and top officials, including his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, have dismissed the need for a war room to bolster the White House's response to Democrats' impeachment inquiry, as President Bill Clinton's White House established when he faced impeachment.

Officials said Mulvaney and Kushner are the officials most focused on developing an impeachment strategy.

Just like the media’s phony Australia freak-out earlier this week, on Thursday, the fake news media hit us with round after round of sound and fury signifying nothing.

As the Ukraine Hoax loses steam, as those of us keeping our heads discover that the Democrats’ decision to cock the impeachment gun before seeing the transcript of the Ukraine call is turning into one of the greatest political blunders since John McCain canceled his presidential campaign to save the economy, the fake news media are hoping to cover up this pratfall with empty hysteria.

Let’s take Thursday’s examples one-by-one, starting with the stupidest first…

Chuck Todd’s Face Melts Because the Constitution, or Something…

Like a 12-year-old girl who just saw a mouse, Todd ran around screaming about democracy n’ stuff with this hysterical and hysterically funny monologue:

I don’t say this lightly. Let’s be frank, a national nightmare is upon us. The basic rules of our democracy are under attack from the president. We begin tonight with a series of admissions by the president that all but ensure his impeachment in the House of Representatives. It’s a moment of truth for Republicans, and they have been largely silent on what we have seen from the president. Today he publicly called on two foreign governments to interfere in the presidential election by investigating his chief 2020 political rival.

Todd’s opener is a flat-out lie. He doesn’t “take this lightly?” What are we, idiots…? These left-wing liars claim our “democracy is under attack” every time a Republican defends himself, and they’ve been saying this about Trump for four years now!

Second verse, same as the first…

Seriously, fuck off.

Trump Spoke to China About Joe Biden!!!

Here’s far-left CNN’s big, fat, fake headline… “Trump raised Biden with Xi in June call housed in highly secure server.”

What’s especially hilarious about this particular piece of propaganda (sorry, I don’t link fake news) is that it took five — five! — so-called reporters to gin up this nonsense.

But do you see what’s going on here? The headline is designed to 1) give us the impression Trump did a quid pro quo with China to investigate a political rival, and 2) then engaged in a “cover up” by hiding the call in this secure server.

Except for the fact that nothing close to that is true, this is really big news!

Here’s what actually happened on this call, which is only revealed after three paragraphs of CNN’s spin:

During a phone call with Xi on June 18, Trump raised Biden’s political prospects as well as those of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who by then had started rising in the polls, according to two people familiar with the discussion. In that call, Trump also told Xi he would remain quiet on Hong Kong protests as trade talks progressed.

So all Trump did was shoot the breeze.

As far as this super-secret server that we’re supposed to believe covers up all of Trump’s impeachable offenses goes… Obama used the same server for his calls.

So once again, you have the fake news media dressing up a non-story, a big zero into a BOMBSHELL.

The Texts! The Texts! The Texts Smoke Like a Gun!

ADDED: We now know that the Taylor’s text lamenting how it’s “crazy to withhold security assistance” was prompted by a Politico article, not something going on in the White House. So this BOMBSHELL is even dumber than I originally believed.

Far-left ABC News, which has already poured Ukrainian fake news over itself and lit itself on fire, hit us with this latest BOMBSHELL: “‘Crazy to withhold security assistance’ to Ukraine for political campaign: Top US diplomat.” (Sorry again, but I don’t link fake news.)

Oh, boy, they got Drumpf now!

The walls are really closing in this time!

Except, not.

The full context of the text messages are what you call … exculpatory. Here’s some real journalism courtesy of Breitbart News:

Newly disclosed text messages show Gordon Sondland, the United States Ambassador to the European Union, defended President Donald Trump’s July 25 telephone call with the leader of Ukraine, affirming the president has said “no quid pro quo of any kind” took place between the heads of state, according to a report. On Thursday, ABC News published excerpts of the texts in which Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, wrote to Sondland, “I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,” seemingly a reference to allegations brought forward by a partisan CIA officer in a complaint that stated the president sought to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the business ties of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President and 2020 White House hopeful Joe Biden.

More:

“I believe you are incorrect about President Trump’s intentions,” Sondland wrote in a message to Taylor. “The president has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo of any kind. The president is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during the campaign.”

What’s more, according to NUMEROUS reports, Ukraine did not 1) feel pressured at all, and 2) was expecting the U.S. aid to continue at the time of the call.

Republicans BREAK WITH TRUMP on Whistleblower!!

OMFG, Republicans are BREAKING WITH Trump!

He’s doomed!

His presidency is DOOMED!

Except, yeah, no… NBC News is gonna NBC News.

All Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) said was, “Whistleblowers should be protected. I stand with Chuck Grassley on this. We have laws in place.”

That’s not “breaking with” Trump.

Buried in the story is the following: “Ernst, who’s facing re-election next year, said last week she wasn’t concerned about the substance of the call. ‘I’ve looked at the transcript; I don’t see anything there,'” she said at a town hall event.

So no one is “breaking with” Trump.

Man alive.

—

With the Ukraine Hoax coming apart like a cheap sweater, this is how the media believe they can cover that fact up, by making up scandals out of whole cloth, out of hyperbolic monologues and headlines that don’t hold up to what little factual reporting there is buried underneath the phony headline.

They got nothing.

They know they got nothing.

But they believe they can fool voters by holding up a banana and screaming about it being a smoking gun.

Elizabeth Warren filled out a form for the State Bar of Texas in 1986 claiming American Indian heritage, according to documents reviewed by The Post https://t.co/YQjkCIxkDt — The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) February 6, 2019

Warren has tried to put her claims of Native American heritage behind her, but a DNA test – taken last year – revealed that Warren had between 1/64th and 1/1,024 Native American ancestry. The results followed years of Warren’s claims of Native American heritage, citing her high cheekbones as physical proof. Additionally, the DNA results indicated an association with individuals from Colombia, Mexico, and Peru– not Native American tribes in the United States, further debunking her claims of Cherokee heritage, specifically.

Warren has since admitted that she is “not a person of color” and “not a citizen of a tribe” and has called her decision to identify as a minority for years on end a “mistake,” although she has yet to offer a detailed explanation for making the claims for years without solid proof.

“Like anyone who’s been honest with themselves, I know that I have made mistakes,” Warren told the crowd at the Native American Presidential Forum in Sioux City, Iowa, in August. “I am sorry for harm I have caused.”

“I have listened and I have learned a lot, and I am grateful for the many conversations we have had together,” she added:

President Trump joked at a rally in August that he “did the Pocahontas thing” a bit too early but signaled that he will revive it if Warren scores the Democrat nomination.

“I did the Pocahontas thing. I hit her really hard, and it looked like she was down and out, but that was too long ago,” told the crowd in New Hampshire.

“I should have waited. But don’t worry, we will revive it. It can be revived. It will be revived. And it can be revived very easily, and very quickly, and we’re gonna have some fun in the state of New Hampshire,” he added."

During a campaign event, Warren was asked by a reporter whether Twitter should ban Trump, to which she responded with a one-word answer: “no.”

This puts the Masachussetts senator at odds with competing Democrat presidential candidate Kamala Harris, who said that Twitter should ban the President because of his commentary on the alleged “whistleblower.”

“He has used his platform, president of the United States, in a way that’s been about inciting fear,” said Harris earlier this week.

Tulsi Gabbard was the first Democrat candidate to break with Harris, promising to “stand up for every American’s right and freedom of speech, no matter how strongly I may disagree with that speech. This freedom is the First Amendment of the Constitution for a reason and I will do all I can to stand up for it.”

Gabbard has previously called out Silicon Valley for political censorship, even filing a lawsuit against tech giant Google over alleged censorship of her campaign ads. She has also called the dominance of big tech over public discourse a “threat to free speech, fair elections, and our democracy.”

Warren’s statements have been more contradictory. While she has disagreed with Harris on Twitter banning Trump, and once condemned Facebook for its power to “shut down debate” after it removed an ad for her campaign in March this year, she has also called for Twitter to censor allegedly “racist” criticism of Kamala Harris."

The Massachusetts senator and White House hopeful told reporters at the SEIU event that she has, in fact, seen enough evidence to convict Trump in the Senate, if the inquiry leads to that.

“Yes,” she said, adding that the “evidence is clear.”

“When Donald Trump released the transcript in which he solicited a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 elections, he broke the law and he did that in context of already having interfered with an investigation into the 2016 elections and Russia being invited to interfere in our elections,” Warren said, resurrecting what the president informally refers to as the Mueller “witch hunt.”

“He’s made it clear that the law doesn’t apply to him and the point of the federal government is to put whatever resources at his disposal to protect himself politically and financially,” she continued, according to the Washington Examiner. “That is not the case.”

“What he has done is an impeachable offense, and he should be impeached,” she added.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) also attended the event but did not go as far as Warren on impeachment, despite pushing for the inquiry on social media.

“I’ll wait until the evidence comes over from the House, and then I’ll share my vote with you,” she said.

Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) dodged the question, telling reporters that he preferred to refrain from speculation.

“I am not going to speculate what I would do in the Senate,” he explained. “I’m a former vice president, I know what occurred in Ukraine, I know what occurred in terms of China, I know what occurred in terms of Russia.”

“This is a president trying to get two of our most serious competitors, and not allies, to decide this election, to decide who he runs against,” he continued, calling Trump a “coward.”

“This guy, like all bullies, is a coward,” Biden assessed. “He does not want to run against me.”

Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) campaign raised $24.6 million in the third quarter, her campaign announced on Friday.

Warren’s campaign reported a hefty $24.6 million raised in the third quarter, putting her just $700k behind her rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), whose campaign boasted of a staggering $25.3 million raised.

Warren’s third-quarter fundraising haul is a $5.5 million increase from the $19.1 million she raised in the second quarter. She has prided her campaign on being 100 percent grassroots-funded, although she reportedly used $10.4 million in leftover funds from her 2018 Senate campaign to cushion her presidential bid. Warren happily courted big donors and attended fundraisers during her 2018 senatorial bid.

Warren campaign manager Roger Lau said the 940,000 contributions came from 500,000 people. The average donation was $26. Three hundred thousand of those people, Lau claimed, were new donors.

Joe Biden’s third-quarter fundraising haul pales in comparison to both Warren’s and Sanders’ strong reports. His campaign only reported $15.2 million, roughly $10 million less than his strongest competitors.

The others are as follows:

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA): $11.6 million

Andrew Yang (D): $10 million

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ): $6 million

Marianne Williamson (D): $3 million

Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO): $2.1 million

Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) campaign on Friday fired its national organizing director Rich McDaniel amid accusations of “inappropriate behavior.”

Warren campaign spokesperson Kristen Orthman released a statement on Friday, confirming that the campaign had been receiving “multiple complaints regarding inappropriate behavior by Rich McDaniel.”

“Over the past two weeks, senior campaign leadership received multiple complaints regarding inappropriate behavior by Rich McDaniel,” Orthman told Politico.

“Over the same time period, the campaign retained outside counsel to conduct an investigation,” she continued.

“Based on the results of the investigation, the campaign determined that his reported conduct was inconsistent with its values and that he could not be a part of the campaign moving forward,” Orthman added.

The firm KK Advising conducted the campaign’s investigation into McDaniel.

Details of the accusations remain unclear, but Politico reported that the allegations did not involve sexual assault, according to a source.

McDaniel released a statement, stressing that he maintains “tremendous respect” for his colleagues “despite any disagreements” they have had in the past.

“I have separated from the campaign and am no longer serving as National Organizing Director,” McDaniel said in a statement, according to Politico.

“I have tremendous respect for my colleagues despite any disagreements we may have had and believe departing at this time is in the best interest of both parties,” he continued.

“I would never intentionally engage in any behavior inconsistent with the campaign or my own values,” he added. “If others feel that I have, I understand it is important to listen even when you disagree. I wish the campaign and my colleagues well.”"

Biden’s campaign announced on Thursday it only raised $15.2 million in the third quarter, significantly less than expected. The sum was less than what was raised by competitors polling below Biden, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg — who raised $25.3 million and $19.1 million, respectively, in the same period.

Although Biden’s total was also less than the $21.5 million he raised in the second quarter, his campaign attempted to put a positive spin on the fundraising numbers. In a statement provided to the press announcing the fundraising haul, Biden’s team claimed that “98 percent of all donations were from grassroots donors” and 56 percent of all contributors were new.

“Today’s fundraising totals put the campaign in a strong position as we enter the fall. The question any campaign faces at this point is whether or not you have the resources to compete in early states and sustain your efforts beyond,” said Greg Schultz, the former vice president’s campaign manager. “Our campaign unequivocally does and builds on our strength each week.”

Despite the campaign’s positive spin, the fundraising numbers underscore Biden’s declining position in the 2020 contest. When the former vice president first announced his campaign in late April, he was seen as the frontrunner for the nomination, a fact confirmed by his domination in the polls and strong fundraising. Since that time, however, Biden’s campaign has been battered by persistent gaffes and ethical questions surrounding his son’s business dealings in Ukraine and China.

All of this has impacted the former vice president’s standing with the Democrat electorate. A slew of recent polls has shown Biden either trailing or tied with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in the first three early voting states of New Hampshire, Iowa, and Nevada. Likewise, Biden has lost his advantage nationally, trailing Warren by as many as six percentage points in a recent survey conducted for the Economist."

Avenatti filed the lien claim on Thursday in Columbus, Ohio, just days after the adult film actress reached a $450,000 settlement with the city regarding an incident last year when she was arrested on suspicion of inappropriately touching an undercover officer. However, the city attorney’s office dropped the charges within hours of the initial event, according to a Fox News report.

Thursday’s court filing stated:

Despite repeated demands that Ms. Daniels fulfill her contractual obligations and pay for the millions of dollars in legal fees and costs she has enjoyed for her benefit over the last approximate 19 months, including in this case, she has refused. Instead, Ms. Daniels maintains that because she is a ‘celebrity,’ she is entitled to free legal services and costs, and when confronted with her repeated failure to pay, she believes that she is entitled to manufacture and fabricate facts designed to impugn the reputation of her counsel and falsely accuse him of a multitude of acts. But the law does not work the way Ms. Daniels wishes. Avenatti’s attorney, Tom Warren, reportedly said his client did great work for Daniels, all while “under intense pressure and scrutiny.” “He made significant personal sacrifices for her benefit. He deserves to be paid by her, not criticized,” Warren concluded.

On May 22, Breitbart News reported Avenatti was charged for defrauding the porn star after federal prosecutors in New York City said he “used a doctored document to divert about $300,000 that Daniels was supposed to get from a book deal, then used the money for personal and business expenses.”

However, prosecutors claimed only half of the money was repaid.

Once the charges were announced, Avenatti defended himself on Twitter by stating, “No monies relating to Ms. Daniels were ever misappropriated or mishandled. She received millions of dollars worth of legal services and we spent huge sums in expenses. She directly paid only $100.00 for all that she received.”

“I look forward to a jury hearing the evidence,” he concluded."

Kamala Harris (D-CA) is shifting her campaign strategy and focusing on Iowa, going as far as preparing “Sunday suppers” for families in the Hawkeye State in hopes of recruiting supporters.

The Harris campaign is touting a new facet of her Iowa swing, dubbed the “I feel your pain” tour. It features a series of more “intimate” meetings with families in the early caucus state, designed to show a different side of the California senator. The tour follows contentious Democrat debates, in which Harris’s competitors — namely, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) — highlighted less-than-flattering aspects of Harris’s prosecutorial record.

A Harris adviser spoke to Politico and suggested that the tour is about isolating issues that affect families day-to-day:

“It’s not about, ‘Let me talk about myself,” a Harris adviser involved in the planning told POLITICO. “It’s, ‘I understand your problems on a human level in a way that you experience them.’ Their concern is not, ‘I need broad systemic overhauls,’ it’s, ‘I can’t get a job, or I can’t pay the bills this month, or I can’t pay my student loans, or my yard is flooded.’” “You have a fundamentally different conversation when you’re sitting around someone’s kitchen table in their home,” the adviser added.

Additionally, Harris plans to “help prepare Sunday suppers in peoples’ homes.”

She also has bigger events planned across the state as well, including a meeting with Moms Demand Action and Women for Kamala events with field organizers.

Harris’s Iowa blitz follows the presidential candidate’s declaration that she is “f*cking moving to Iowa.”

A reporter overheard the remark as Harris expressed her strategy to a colleague:

The Harris campaign tried to embrace the “oops” moment with a dash of levity:

Harris continues to face an uphill battle in national polls, failing to recapture her once-held top tier status. The most recent Economist/YouGov poll shows Harris in fifth place with just five percent support. Similarly, a Monmouth University Poll released Wednesday shows the California lawmaker tied with Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) in fifth place, with five percent support each.

Harris has a long way to go in Iowa, according to the current Real Clear Politics average. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Joe Biden (D), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Buttigieg are leading in Iowa with 23 percent, 20.3 percent, 12 percent, 11.3 percent, respectively. Harris is in fifth place with 5.3 percent support."

Pelosi said on Friday that this is a “very sad time for our country.”

“Not any of us came to Congress to impeach a president. This is a very sad time for our country. This is a very somber time for our country,” she said, calling the emergence of the Trump-Zelensky phone call an “explosion.”

“September 17 of this year, that very day, was the day that this explosion occurred and we found out about the telephone conversation, which is completely in defiance of the Constitution of the United States,” Pelosi claimed.

“Some people say, ‘Why are you doing this, he’s not worth it to divide the country this way,'” she continued. “He might not be, but our Constitution is worth it, and our democracy is worth it.”

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) admitted on Thursday that the House may proceed with impeachment before fleshing out the facts.

At the same time, (the White House has) apparently every incentive to try to make it drag on forever. And there may very well come a point where we have to make the decision that the effort to obstruct has become such an impediment that we have reached a decision point — even in the absence of being able to fully follow and flesh out the facts surrounding the president’s Ukraine conduct.

House Democrats have yet to hold a full House vote on the impeachment inquiry.

Alexis Pelosi, the speaker’s youngest daughter, and her cousin, Laurence, were on the host committee for a fundraiser hosted on the former vice president’s behalf at the home of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) in San Francisco, California. Biden was in attendance for the event, which was one of three his campaign had scheduled in the Bay Area on Thursday.

Neither Alexis nor Laurence Pelosi’s attendance at the Biden fundraiser is surprising. Alexis, a documentary filmmaker and journalist, has been cultivating a more liberal profile herself in Hollywood and Washington, DC. Although less overtly political than her mother, her work behind the camera has taken a more ideological turn recently. Two of her better-known documentaries in the past decade have focused on the issues of immigration and the impact large donors have on America’s political system.

The shift has been noticeable in her campaign donations. Apart from one donation to the House Democrats PAC in 2002, the younger Pelosi made no political contributions until 2016 when she donated to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s failed presidential campaign. Since then, she has donated to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and made several smaller contributions to progressive candidates and causes. Alexis donated $1,000 to Biden’s campaign on April 25, the day he announced his candidacy.

Laurence, on the other hand, as the founder of an investment firm specializing in real estate, is lesser-known among the public. He has, however, been contributing to Democrat candidates and causes since at least 1993. Like his cousin, Laurence also donated $1,000 to Biden’s campaign on the day of the former vice president’s announcement. It is unclear if either has donated further to Biden, as the Federal Election Commission (FEC) has yet to make records available for the third quarter of this year.

Even though the Pelosis attendance at a fundraiser on Biden’s behalf is not remarkable, the same cannot be said of the timing. The fundraiser comes less than two weeks after Nancy Pelosi launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump’s conduct with Ukraine. The act, which is the first step in the process of bringing charges against the president, was in response to Trump’s suggestion that the Ukrainian government probe into Hunter Biden’s business dealings in the country. In particular, Trump and others have noted the younger Biden profited from opportunities that were unavailable to ordinary businessmen and seemed to directly intersect with his father’s political influence.

At the center of the controversy is how Hunter Biden secured an appointment to the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian oil and natural gas giant, in 2014. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden secured the position, which paid as much as $83,000 per month, despite having no background in the energy industry or Ukraine.

The younger Biden’s lack of experience, coupled with the fact that his father had just been made the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine, immediately raised questions from ethics watchdogs in both the U.S. and Europe about a conflict of interest. Furthering the ethical cloud over the appointment is that this came during the same month that Mykola Zlochevsky, Burisma’s founder, had his assets seized in the United Kingdom for suspicion of money laundering. Some have speculated Hunter Biden’s ascension to Burisma’s board was an attempt by Zlochevsky to curry favor with western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of his business dealings.

A brazen attempt along such lines would not be totally ill-suited for Zlochevsky. The Burisma founder is rumored to be one of eastern Europe’s top oligarchs, a position obtained while serving in the Ukrainian government under former President Viktor Yanukovych — a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was during his tenure in government as Ukraine’s minister of natural resources that Burisma received its oil and gas licenses–inappropriately, many suspect.

It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky’s legal troubles that Joe Biden’s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Biden, who has publicly bragged about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor’s ability to tackle corruption.

Unofficially, though, it was well known Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster, he was warned to back off of the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin’s successor dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky, allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having fled it in 2014.

Despite the strong implications of conflicts of interest and wrongdoing, Nancy Pelosi chose to ignore the storied history of the Biden family’s affairs in Ukraine before choosing to launch her impeachment inquiry. In fact, the rush in which the speaker and her allies in the Democrat leadership moved to launch an inquiry has drawn accusations from President Trump that the entire proceeding is a “witch hunt.” Republicans in Congress have echoed the sentiment, noting the speaker chose to ignore precedent by refusing to hold a vote on the impeachment inquiry, and her deputies, such as Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), have threatened to charge White House officials with obstruction of justice if they “stonewall” the probe.

For her part, the speaker has done nothing to shield herself from such criticism and accusations. One day prior to her daughter and nephew attending a fundraiser for Biden, Nancy Pelosi declared during an appearance on ABC News that the “re-election of Donald Trump would do irreparable damage to the United States.”

Representatives for Pelosi did not return requests for comment on this story.

Outside of the immediate impeachment circumstances, the fundraiser also poses questions regarding the speaker’s preference in the race for the 2020 Democrat nomination. Even though Pelosi has made no official endorsement, the fact that her daughter and nephew are backing Biden raises the question if she herself is in the former vice president’s corner.

A review of FEC filings shows that no other member of the speaker’s family has donated to a candidate other than Biden, even though recent polling has shown Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) leads in their home state of California."

The 34-year-old from Karachi looks after $12 million winning machine Enable , who is chasing a record third straight Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in Paris Sunday.

Shawani is head groom and work rider for Enable at the Newmarket stables of champion trainer John Gosden , whom he credits for teaching him everything he knows -- including the basics of how to ride a horse.

""The boss [Gosden], he's a gentleman, he's always looked after me very well. He was paying me full wages, and at that time I was absolutely useless. That's the truth,"" Shawani told CNN over the phone after finishing a day's work at Gosden's Clarehaven stables.

Imran Shawani (second from right) has worked for trainer John Gosden (right) for 14 years.

'Absolutely sh*t rider'

Imran joined Gosden's team 14 years ago after an introduction from his brother Anwar, who had formerly worked for another trainer in England, Mick Channon.

Seeing Imran on a horse for the first time, Gosden was not impressed.

""The boss said, 'Oh my God, you need to learn a lot,'"" he said.

""He used to teach me riding for one hour every day after third lot on the pony. He taught me how to hold to the reins, how to go up and down when the horse trots and how to stand on a horse when it canters.

""I was always doing some mistakes but the boss always ignore, ignore, ignore and he gave me lots of chance.

""I was an absolutely s**t rider.""

Imran Shawani holds Enable as Frankie Dettori celebrates after winning the Yorkshire Oaks in August.

'Luckiest person'

It was a steep learning curve, given he only knew a couple of people in the country and his English was rudimentary at best.

Once, Gosden enquired if a horse in Shawani's charge had been doing any coughing.

""I'd been told to always use sorry, thank you or excuse me. So I just said, 'Thank you,'"" he laughed.

Gosden had to demonstrate a cough -- and so Shawani's learning continued.

Another brother Afzal rode Enable's father Nathaniel, but when Imran chose her to look after early in her three-year-old season, little did he know she would go on to become a wonder horse.

Since then she has notched 12 straight wins including two Arcs, the Epsom Oaks, the Irish Oaks, two King George VI's at Ascot and the Breeders' Cup Turf , all in tandem with veteran Italian jockey Frankie Dettori.

Now, Shawani starts work at 5:30 a.m. every day to prepare Enable before riding out with her in training.

""She's beautiful, she knows she's a superstar,"" he added. ""If you take her on Warren Hill [Newmarket's gallops], she wants to show off she's Enable.

""I'm so proud because whenever she goes out for a canter everybody wants to see her and touch her.

""She's so special for everyone and if you give her a polo or a carrot she's going to be your friend.

""I think I am the luckiest person in the yard and in Newmarket.""

Of the upcoming Paris showdown, Shawani added: ""She's a tough horse, she's the best and she's in very good form.

""If she wins she's going to make history and be a world champion horse. Imagine what I'll feel. I'll leave it to you."""

5. Trump, unleashed: Donald Trump has spent the last week talking and tweeting almost nonstop as he tries to fight his way out of mounting allegations over his pressure campaign to get the Ukrainians to look into debunked allegations of wrongdoing against Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

And the rhetoric from Trump has gone to previously unseen heights -- even for Trump. He's accused Rep. Adam Schiff (California) of treason, he's attacked Mitt Romney in deeply personal terms -- more on that directly below -- and he's repeating, repeating, repeating long disproven lies.

All of which means that when Trump travels to Minneapolis on Thursday for a ""Keep America Great"" rally, well, look out. Trump is always at his most, well, Trump-y at these campaign rallies -- and, given the walls closing in on him in Washington, he could well use the Minnesota rally as a venting session the likes of which even longtime Trump observers rarely see.

Stay tuned. It's going to be a doozy.

4. Any other Mitt Romneys out there?: Republicans have, almost uniformly, closed ranks around Trump even as a Republicans have, almost uniformly, closed ranks around Trump even as a second whistleblower has emerged regarding the President allegedly using the power of his office for political gain during interactions over the summer with Ukraine.

Only Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) has publicly criticized Trump in any way, calling the President's urgings of China and Ukraine to investigate the Bidens ""wrong"" and ""appalling."" Trump immediately struck back, referring to Romney as a ""pompous 'ass'"" (I have no idea why he put ""ass"" in quotes) and suggesting that the 2012 Republican nominee was ""begging"" to be his secretary of state.

Any Republican who was weighing speaking out about Trump's behavior with Ukraine (and his plea for China to investigate his main rival for the 2020 nomination) now can have no illusions about what such criticism will be met with: Pure, unadulterated anger from Trump -- and likely vilification from the President's base.

Is any prominent Republican other than Romney willing to risk speaking out when that reaction is assured? Principle vs. politics, anyone?

3. Fundraising losers...: With the With the third fundraising quarter ending at the close of last month , most of the major candidates have released how much they brought in and how much they spent between July 1 and September 30.

Let's go through the losers first.

* Joe Biden: When you are a former vice president and the race's frontrunner, you need to be at or very close to the top of the money chase. Biden's $15 million raised in the third quarter is well off the pace and a significant drop-off from when Biden raised $21.5 million from April 1 to June 30 -- his first three months of active fundraising. His numbers will re-ignite the debate over whether he has real grassroots energy behind his establishment candidacy. Think about this: The mayor of South Bend, Indiana -- Pete Buttigieg -- raised $4 million more than Biden in the third quarter and has now out-raised the former vice president for six months straight.

* Cory Booker: The New Jersey senator's plea for $1.7 million in the final days of the quarter -- in order, he said, for him to remain in the race -- drew a ton of publicity. Even though Booker met his goal, he still only brought in $6 million for the entire three-month period. That likely means he will be facing another dire financial deadline in the not-too-distant future.

2. ... and fundraising winners:

* Bernie Sanders: Even as his poll numbers have stagnated somewhat, the Vermont senator's small-dollar, online fundraising network continues to deliver. Sanders topped the field in the third quarter with more than $25 million raised and has now raised more than $71 million this year. That ensures he will not only have real organizations in all of the early states but will also be able to continue fighting for the nomination for months.

* Elizabeth Warren: While Sanders edged out Warren for the top spot by about $500,000, Warren's third quarter fundraising is yet another data point proving how much momentum she has built behind her candidacy. Warren already has the best organization in Iowa, and fundraising like she put on the board over the last three months ensures her campaign will be able to fund a (TV) air assault as well.

* Andrew Yang: The tech entrepreneur raised $10 million in the third quarter, which, at least to me was the single most surprising result of the fundraising race. Yang's total put him well above what Booker, as well as Sen. Michael Bennet (Colorado) and Gov. Steve Bullock (Montana) raised, and within shouting distance of Sen. Kamala Harris (California). That's a stunner, and shows how far he's come since the year started and almost no one knew who he was.

1. The age/health debate is here: It was probably inevitable, given that the four most likely candidates to be president in 2021 are 70+ years old, but Bernie Sanders' recent heart attack has officially injected the issue of age and health into the 2020 campaign.

After several days of uncertainty, Sanders' campaign confirmed that he had suffered a heart attack on the campaign trail and, following his release from the hospital late last week, he has returned to Vermont. His campaign has canceled its events until further notice but has said Sanders will be at the next debate -- set for October 15 in Ohio.

While the relatively advanced ages of Sanders (78), Joe Biden (76) and Elizabeth Warren (70) has been a sort of low buzz in the background of the Democratic race so far, those days are now over. All three candidates had previously pledged to release their medical records before the Iowa caucuses on February 3, 2020, but the urgency of those releases is significantly higher now than it was even a week ago.

(Remember that Donald Trump was the oldest person ever elected to a first term when he won the presidency in 2016 at age 70. During the campaign, his personal physician released a letter proclaiming that Trump ""would be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency."" Trump is now 73. In January of this year, he underwent a physical which found him in ""very good health overall."")"

The ad is geared to show a Democratic audience that Biden, who polls show battling Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont at the top of the polls, is the most electable candidate -- or at least the one Trump fears the most -- in the party's 2020 field.

It is also a response to the Trump campaign's ads in early states that include false claims about Biden, his son and Ukraine and hit Democrats for beginning impeachment proceedings over Trump's effort to pressure the Ukrainian President to investigate the Bidens. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden in Ukraine.

The Trump campaign is doing an ad blitz in the same four states starting this weekend, going after Biden. The Biden-focused ad buy totals more than $1 million, campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh confirmed to CNN. That buy is part of an overall $10 million buy from the campaign and Republican National Committee.

(CNN) We've recently learned two things about Bernie Sanders: that he had a heart attack, and that he was not immediately forthcoming with the news. I wouldn't go so far to call this a ""cover-up,"" not in the Age of Trump, where an entire presidency is a cover-up. But it's dismaying, as it feels like political ""business as usual"" for Bernie to lack transparency, even for a few days, and even under these vulnerable conditions.

Jay Parini

Bernie is my senator, a fellow Vermonter. (Like most people around here, I call him Bernie.) I've been a supporter since he ran for mayor in Burlington some 30 years ago. In my view, no American politician has done more to advance progressive causes in the United States, pushing the Democrats from terrified middle-of-the-road positions on health care and economic inequality to a place we never dreamed we'd see in this lifetime.

He has spoken loudly for the poor, the disenfranchised. He was an early opponent of the Iraq War, unlike Joe Biden. He has a strong grasp of the existential threat posed by climate change.

But the heart attack is now a political problem — for him and the Democrats. It may not be possible for Bernie to continue pushing himself in the way he'd have to push himself to be nominated and to beat Donald Trump.

And beating Trump has become a national emergency. As recent weeks have shown, Trump is dangerously out of touch with reality, with no understanding of the constitutional separation of powers. Trump's behavior with regard to Ukraine (which is likely the tip of a proverbial iceberg) — and more blatantly, his invitation to China to interfere in America's election — makes it clear that he is willing to upend the democratic process itself, OUR democratic process, using his vast authority solely for his own, personal benefit.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has resurfaced, showing the then-Senate candidate claiming to possess “plenty of pictures” highlighting her Native American heritage.

A reporter asked Warren in the 2012 video if she possessed “anything in the house that reflects her Native American heritage.” Warren said she did, but refused to show the items.

“I have plenty of pictures. They’re not for you,” Warren replied:

Another resurfaced clip shows Warren doubling down on her Native ancestry claims, telling the story of her parents. She claimed her family was divided due to her father’s parents’ prejudice against her mother, who was – Warren claimed – part Cherokee and Delaware.

“It was an issue in our family the whole time I grew up, about these two families,” Warren told New England Cable News’s Jim Braude.

Braude followed up, asking Warren – who identified as a minority – if she would still identify as such if her ancestors were black instead.

“If your family heritage had an African American like you have, the grandfather or great grandparent who was a Cherokee, would you call yourself a black, and expect African Americans to accept that?” Braude asked.

“If that same ancestor was black and not Cherokee,” he added.

“If my Father’s parents had said, ‘You can’t marry her because she’s black, and that had been part of our family growing up, that we had two different families?” Warren replied.

“You would be comfortable with saying you’re black?” Braude asked.

“It would be part of identification,” she said:

The Massachusetts senator has been under fire for identifying as a minority in the past, listing herself as a minority professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and Harvard Law School. She also claimed Native American heritage on her Texas Bar registration card:

Elizabeth Warren filled out a form for the State Bar of Texas in 1986 claiming American Indian heritage, according to documents reviewed by The Post https://t.co/YQjkCIxkDt — The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) February 6, 2019

Warren has tried to put her claims of Native American heritage behind her, but a DNA test – taken last year – revealed that Warren had between 1/64th and 1/1,024 Native American ancestry. The results followed years of Warren’s claims of Native American heritage, citing her high cheekbones as physical proof. Additionally, the DNA results indicated an association with individuals from Colombia, Mexico, and Peru– not Native American tribes in the United States, further debunking her claims of Cherokee heritage, specifically.

Warren has since admitted that she is “not a person of color” and “not a citizen of a tribe” and has called her decision to identify as a minority for years on end a “mistake,” although she has yet to offer a detailed explanation for making the claims for years without solid proof.

“Like anyone who’s been honest with themselves, I know that I have made mistakes,” Warren told the crowd at the Native American Presidential Forum in Sioux City, Iowa, in August. “I am sorry for harm I have caused.”

“I have listened and I have learned a lot, and I am grateful for the many conversations we have had together,” she added:

President Trump joked at a rally in August that he “did the Pocahontas thing” a bit too early but signaled that he will revive it if Warren scores the Democrat nomination.

“I did the Pocahontas thing. I hit her really hard, and it looked like she was down and out, but that was too long ago,” told the crowd in New Hampshire.

“I should have waited. But don’t worry, we will revive it. It can be revived. It will be revived. And it can be revived very easily, and very quickly, and we’re gonna have some fun in the state of New Hampshire,” he added."

“Yes,” she said, adding that the “evidence is clear.”

“He’s made it clear that the law doesn’t apply to him and the point of the federal government is to put whatever resources at his disposal to protect himself politically and financially,” she continued, according to the Washington Examiner. “That is not the case.”

“What he has done is an impeachable offense, and he should be impeached,” she added.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) also attended the event but did not go as far as Warren on impeachment, despite pushing for the inquiry on social media.

“I’ll wait until the evidence comes over from the House, and then I’ll share my vote with you,” she said.

Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) dodged the question, telling reporters that he preferred to refrain from speculation.

“I am not going to speculate what I would do in the Senate,” he explained. “I’m a former vice president, I know what occurred in Ukraine, I know what occurred in terms of China, I know what occurred in terms of Russia.”

Warren’s biography has been central to her pitch to voters. For example, in Franconia, New Hampshire, in August — the town hall meeting that marked the start of her latest surge — she said (emphasis added):

I have known what I wanted to do since second grade. You may laugh — you didn’t decide ’til third grade, fourth grade. [Laugher] Not me, man. I have known since second grade: I wanted to be a public school teacher. Can we hear it for America’s public school teachers? [Applause] Oh, I knew — and I invested early. I used to line my dollies up and teach school. I had a reputation for being tough, but fair. [Laughter] I’m just kidding. I loved it, I loved it. And I never wavered from what I wanted to do. But by the time I graduated from high school, my family didn’t have the money to pay for a college application, much less to send me off to a four years at a university. So, like a lot of Americans, I have a story that kind of has a bunch of twists and turns in it. And here’s how mine goes. I got a scholarship to college — yay! — and then, at 19, I fell in love, dropped out, got married, took a minimum wage job. [Laughter] It was my choice, and it was going to be a good life. But it wasn’t a dream. I thought I’d given up on ever being able to teach school. And then, and then — I found it. I found a commuter college, 45 minutes away, that cost $50 a semester. And for a price I could pay for, on a part-time waitressing job, I finished my four-year diploma, I became a special needs teacher — I have lived my dream job! [Applause] Now do I have any special needs teachers here? [Applause] Oh, good — I’ve got some. Got some here. Fabulous. Back me up on this: teaching special needs is not a job, it’s a calling. And I loved it. I truly loved it. I still can remember the faces — I had little ones. Still remember their faces. And I probably would still be doing that work today, only my story has some more twists and turns. And here’s how the next twist goes. By the end of my first year in teaching, I was visibly pregnant. And the principal did what principals did in those days: wished me luck and hired someone else for the job. Okay, so I’m at home, I’ve got a baby now, no chance to get a job. What am I going to do? And the answer is: I’ll to go to law school!

Warren told a similar story at the last Democratic Party presidential primary debate in September (emphasis added):

By the time I graduated from high school, my family didn’t have money for a college application, much less to send me off to four years at a university. And my story, like a lot of stories, has a lot of twists and turns. Got a scholarship, and then at 19, I got married, dropped out of school, took a minimum wage job, thought my dream was over. I got a chance down the road at the University of Houston. And I made it as a special needs teacher. I still remember that first year as a special needs teacher. I could tell you what those babies looked like. I had 4- to 6-year-olds. But at the end of that first year, I was visibly pregnant. And back in the day, that meant that the principal said to me — wished me luck and hired someone else for the job. So, there I am, I’m at home, I got a baby, I can’t have a job. What am I going to do? Here’s resilience. I said, I’ll go to law school.

However, Warren’s current version of the story contradicts a version she told during a recently-resurfaced interview in 2007, when — as a Harvard Law School professor — she described her career path (4:42 to 7:49, emphasis added):

I’m of that generation where there were only two things that a woman could do if she wanted to do something other than stay home, and that was: she could become a nurse or she could become a teacher. And so there were some awfully able women who taught me from grade school on. And what they opened me up to was the possibility that I could become a teacher. And, frankly, that’s when I went off — When I went off to college, the whole idea was so that I could be a teacher. That’s what I wanted to do … I came to college on a debate scholarship. I was 16 years old when I graduated from high school. And I got a full scholarship in debate — that was room, board, tuition, books, and a little spending money. It was a fabulous scholarship. At George Washington University. If I would debate for them. It was sort of the equivalent of an athletic scholarship, only this was one that actually a girl could get, even though there weren’t very many girls in debate, either. I was going to be a teacher. And I quickly switched over and decided what I wanted to do was work with brain injured children. And so I got my degree in speech pathology and audiology, which meant that I would be able to work with children who had head trauma, and other kinds of brain injuries. And that’s what I did. .. I was married at 19, and then graduated from college, actually, after I’d married. And my first year of post graduation, I worked — it was within a public school system, but I worked with the children with disabilities. And I did that for a year. And then that summer — I actually didn’t have the education courses, so I was on an “emergency certificate,” it was called. And I went back to graduate school, and took a couple of courses in education, and said, “I don’t think this is going to work out for me.” And I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby, and I stayed home for a couple of years, and I was really casting about, thinking what am I going to do. … And so I went back home to Oklahoma … for Christmas, and saw a bunch of the boys that I’d been in high school debate with, and they’d all gone on to law school. And they said, “You should go to law school, you’ll love it.” And I said, “You really think so?” And they said, “Of all of us who should have gone to law school, you’re the one who should have gone to law school.”

There are consistent themes in these stories, such as that Warren wanted to teach children with special needs — as well as some puzzles (such as her claim that she could not afford to apply to college, then received a scholarship).

But there are also contradictions — and the most glaring is the different reasons given for her leaving her teaching job.

In the 2007 version of the story, the reason for her leaving her job was that she lacked the necessary education qualifications and was on a special contract — not because a male principal dismissed her for becoming pregnant. It was her subsequent studies in education, not discrimination, that convinced her to choose a different career path.

However, on the campaign trail, Warren has chosen to tell what Mediaite’s Tommy Christopher describes as a story in which “[t]he central idea has always been that she was living her dream of being a public school special ed teacher until some villainous Mad Men-era principal put the kibosh on the whole thing because of her baby bump.”

The program that interviewed Warren is called Conversations with History, a project of the University of California. The story about the contradictions appears to have been broken first by blogger Jeryl Bier, who in turn credited left-wing Jacobin magazine wrier Meagan Day, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, for the information.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in the 2020 Democrat presidential primary would not prevent a scenario where a sitting vice president’s child is allowed to serve on the board of a foreign corporation, as former Vice President Joe Biden’s son did.

Released last month, Warren’s plan to “End Washington Corruption” seeks to end a series of loopholes where presidents, vice presidents, lawmakers, and their family members have been able to effectively sell influence to line their pockets — a scheme that the Clintons were famously accused of with the Clinton Global Foundation, and one which Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, are now accused.

In April 2014, as Breitbart News’ Haris Alic has reported, Hunter Biden was appointed to serve on the board of Ukrainian oil company Burisma despite having no qualifications do to so. At the same time, Biden led the Obama administration’s response to Russia’s invasion of Crimea, pushing billions of dollars in U.S. taxpayer aid to the Ukrainian government. Some of that money allegedly filtered out to Burisma, the corporation of which Biden’s son was a board member.

When asked last month whether her anti-corruption plan would prevent a case where a sitting vice president’s child could serve on the board of a foreign corporation, Warren evaded the question, saying “I don’t know.”

“I’d have to go back and look at the details on the plan,” Warren said.

A review of Warren’s anti-corruption plan, though, reveals that there is no explicit language preventing another case where a sitting vice president’s child can serve on the board of a corporation, let alone a foreign corporation.

The closest Warren’s plan comes to dealing with a Hunter Biden scenario is banning lawmakers and their staff from serving on the boards of corporations, domestic and foreign.

“My plan bans members of Congress and senior congressional staff from serving on corporate boards — whether or not they’re paid to do so,” the plan states.

While Warren’s plan would mandate presidential transition team members to disclose their involvement with corporations, foreign governments, and other potential conflicts of interest, this portion of the plan does not extend to members of an administration who later involve themselves in potential conflicts of interest.

“It also strengthens ethics requirements for presidential transition teams to ensure that those who are shaping our government disclose any conflicts of interest and comply with the highest ethical standards,” the plan reads.

Though the Hunter Biden question was asked of Warren almost two weeks ago, her campaign has yet to follow up on whether they would revise their anti-corruption plan to include banning the family members of sitting vice presidents from serving on the boards of foreign corporations.

MIT researcher Alexander Agadjanian published his latest research in the New York Times, where he revealed that swing voters likely are six percentage points less likely to vote for a Democrat against President Trump in the 2020 election after learning of the leftist policy positions they have embraced.

Agadjanian surveyed nearly 4,000 voters, showing half of them headlines where 2020 Democrats have endorsed decriminalizing illegal immigration, giving free healthcare to illegal aliens, ending private health insurance, and providing free college tuition for applicants.

The other half were shown headlines on general 2020 Democrat primary news, like when scheduled debates and townhalls are to occur. From there, the research found swing voters are less likely to vote for a Democrat when they learn of their policy proposals:

When deciding between Mr. Trump and the Democratic nominee, voters in the middle — the independents who could ultimately tilt things in Mr. Trump’s favor — became six percentage points less likely to vote Democratic after reading about the leftward turn compared with the independents who had read the innocuous content. [Emphasis added]

Likewise, the research found that there is no increase in mobilization to vote in the 2020 election for Democrat voters who learned of the candidates’ endorsement of leftist policies.

“Democrats who read about the leftward positions did not indicate they were more motivated to vote and campaign for the eventual nominee than those who hadn’t read about them,” Agadjanian notes.

As Breitbart News has chronicled, 2020 Democrats such as former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) have endorsed some of the least popular policy positions in the Democrat primary.

For example, the most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that a plan to give free, taxpayer-funded healthcare to all 11 million to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S. is the most unpopular policy position thus far. The plan was endorsed by Biden, Warren, Sanders, and the majority of other Democrat primary candidates.

Similarly, voters by a majority remain opposed to raising taxes on working and middle-class Americans in order to end private health insurance and provide “Medicare for All” to all U.S. residents. The plan to end private health insurance, endorsed by Warren and Sanders, has turned off American union workers as millions would have their employer-negotiated healthcare plans terminated should such a plan take effect.

“Depression over the current field was swirling through my head the other day,” Brown wrote in his latest column Saturday for the San Francisco Chronicle, before a portrait of Muhammad Ali had him thinking about a “rematch.”

“Think about it. Hillary is still the smartest of the bunch. She’s also better known than any of the candidates, so she doesn’t need a lot of money,” Brown argued.

“Clinton is the only candidate short of Barack Obama who has the brains, the battle-tested brawn and the national presence to take out Trump. And Obama can’t run.” he said.

Brown’s latest vote of no confidence in the current Democratic field echoes his earlier pronouncements. In February, he had already declared that none of the candidates — including his former girlfriend, Kamala Harris — could beat Trump.

The Democratic candidates “all have impressive credentials, winning personalities and positive messages, but none displays the “people personality” that our media-savvy president has mastered,” Brown wrote at the time.

The most recent Public Policy Institute of California poll showed Harris in a distant fourth among likely Democratic primary voters in her home state, while former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) were locked in a dead heat for first place.

“However, among voters with a candidate preference, more than half (53%) would consider supporting another candidate,” the PPIC poll added.

Pelosi said on Friday that this is a “very sad time for our country.”

“Not any of us came to Congress to impeach a president. This is a very sad time for our country. This is a very somber time for our country,” she said, calling the emergence of the Trump-Zelensky phone call an “explosion.”

“September 17 of this year, that very day, was the day that this explosion occurred and we found out about the telephone conversation, which is completely in defiance of the Constitution of the United States,” Pelosi claimed.

“Some people say, ‘Why are you doing this, he’s not worth it to divide the country this way,'” she continued. “He might not be, but our Constitution is worth it, and our democracy is worth it.”

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) admitted on Thursday that the House may proceed with impeachment before fleshing out the facts.

At the same time, (the White House has) apparently every incentive to try to make it drag on forever. And there may very well come a point where we have to make the decision that the effort to obstruct has become such an impediment that we have reached a decision point — even in the absence of being able to fully follow and flesh out the facts surrounding the president’s Ukraine conduct.

House Democrats have yet to hold a full House vote on the impeachment inquiry.

Adam Schiff (D-CA) from the Democrats’ “impeachment inquiry” of President Donald Trump.

McCarthy explained Schiff should now be considered a “fact witness” in the broader investigation of these matters given his and his staff’s role in coordinating with the whistleblower over the summer.

McCarthy said the pair of major revelations this week—first that Schiff’s staff met with the whistleblower before he or she reported concerns to the Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG), and second that the whistleblower concealed the Schiff staff meeting from the ICIG, as the ICIG testified this week—undercut Schiff’s ability to move forward with the investigation. As such, McCarthy said, Schiff and his staff should now be considered “fact witnesses” in the investigation—and Pelosi should formally sideline him, removing him from his chairmanship and having him recuse himself from an investigation it would be impossible for him to honestly oversee.

“Something very, very interesting came out yesterday and they control what happens—they’ll leak just a couple texts instead of the full transcript,” McCarthy said in an exclusive interview on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel this weekend.

“If the whole transcript was out there, you’d ask why go on with this investigation? Yesterday, we had the ICIG, which is the Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, in for a hearing. What we found out was he testified that the whistleblower never told him that he had already met with Schiff’s staff. Two things happen from that: It already goes to the political bias of the whistleblower. The whistleblower filling out the forms, there was a point there to put that in and [he] skipped it—did not want them to know, Schiff’s staff, that he had met with them yet. Nobody knows what was said with Schiff’s staff. Nobody knows if he met with Schiff, what they talked about, no one knows how many times they met. No one knows any about this except Schiff and his staff. Now, having done that, they are what is called ‘fact witnesses.’ When you are a fact witness, you cannot be a head of an investigation and be a prosecutor. No one in our judicial system would ever allow that. Why? Because Schiff and his staff should now be called in as witnesses. We need to cross-examine them. What did they talk about? What did you tell them? You can’t be in charge of the investigation too. This is such a hoax, every element of it, it goes against every basic fairness,” said McCarthy.

McCarthy added that the whistleblower’s decision to conceal the Schiff meeting from the Inspector General—and Schiff having lied about it to the public, which undercuts his credibility as chairman of the Intelligence Committee and as Pelosi’s lead investigator—casts a shadow of doubt over the Democrats’ already-hyper-partisan impeachment effort. Schiff’s broader history, McCarthy noted, is one filled with deceit and lies—dating back to when he falsely claimed to have “evidence” of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, something Schiff did not have and does not have.

“Even a greater point to make is that you went to the Intel Committee, then you went to the IG, and you did not tell them,” McCarthy said. “You withheld that information. Then when you had a form, you should have checked that you had done that, you did not check that form either. You made a conscious decision not to tell the IG that you had already met—and Schiff was asked this. Okay, let’s go through Schiff’s history, first he told America he had proof [of Russian collusion] beyond circumstantial. Well you know what? The millions of dollars and thousands of people looking at it—Mueller—could not find this fake proof that Schiff put America through a nightmare of for two years. Then we found out when they brought in Michael Cohen, his staff met with him how many hours? More than ten hours, three different times. We also found out later that Schiff also ran into Glenn Simpson—remember Fusion GPS?—and that he did not share that. Now, when he’s asked on television, he was asked on his own home television MSNBC does he know who the whistleblower is? He said no. He says, ‘I hope he comes forward, I hope he reaches out to us.’ He openly lied—numerous times.”

Specifically, McCarthy said the decision to allow Schiff to continue to lead the investigation lies solely with Pelosi—and he said that given Schiff’s clear dishonesty and lies, it is time for Pelosi to formally remove him from the plum Intelligence Committee chairmanship. Failure to do so, McCarthy said, could put America’s national security at risk given the fact that the Intelligence Committee handles America’s secrets. But leaving someone who should clearly be a witness not an investigator in an investigatory role, McCarthy said, undermines the credibility of the Democrats’ investigations—making them purely partisan.

“To be chair of the Intel Committee, it’s just one person to appoint: the Speaker of the House,” McCarthy said. “I appoint the Intel Committee on the Republican side. I don’t have to go through conference. The Intel Committee gets the top secrets that America ever sees, threats, and everywhere else. And this is a man who openly lies to the country to try to change the outcome of an election just because he doesn’t like the outcome? One, he should no longer be chairman of that committee. She should remove him. Two, he does not have the right to be the head of the investigation. It’s not the jurisdiction of his committee. But more importantly, he is a fact witness. He does not have the right to do that. If you believe in the rule of law, he does not have the ability to [lead the investigation]. Everything about this investigation proves it just is a political hack job to just try to go after the president.”

Schiff is hardly the only high-profile Democrat that McCarthy believes should be called as a witness in this investigation. He also said that former President Barack Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden, Biden’s son Hunter Biden, and other top leftists should also be called as witnesses for their roles in these matters.

“What I would to do is I would like to call Adam Schiff as a witness,” McCarthy said. ”I would like to call Hunter Biden as a witness. I would like to see Vice President Biden as a witness. I would like to see Barack Obama as a witness, since he put Biden as envoy to Ukraine. These are all things we are being denied because they have already written the script that they want to impeach this president, they want to discredit democracy, and they want to change the outcome.”

But for now, as the Democrats under Pelosi’s stewardship keep the “impeachment inquiry” as a partisan matter, McCarthy says, they continue to disregard norms and traditions when it comes to impeachment—further undermining their case, and driving the fight even more into partisan camps.

“In modern history, when they went to impeach Nixon, when they went to impeach Clinton, when they went to impeach two judges, there’s always been a process for fairness that you’d first have a vote to open an impeachment inquiry,” McCarthy said. “And why you would do that as the full body, they literally say it in the past as to why: This is such an important vote. If you are going to discredit democracy by doing this, you shouldn’t take it lightly. Everybody in America lends their voice to 435 members of Congress, so they should be heard on whether you move forward. What happens when you do that is they set the rules. In the Bill Clinton impeachment, there were 900 pages. They gave the minority subpoena power. They allowed the president to be able to know who the witnesses were, to object, to cross-examine, to do other stuff. Could you imagine going to trial and not being able to call a witness, not being able to cross-examine? So there’s two reasons why Speaker Pelosi is doing this. One, she doesn’t want to put her 31 members who are Democrats who sit in seats President Trump carried to cast that vote. Secondly, she wants to take advantage and not allow any fairness. She moved it out of Judiciary, which has the jurisdiction to do it, because she moved it into Intel. Why did she move it into Intel? Well, now we’re finding out—Schiff’s staff met with the whistleblower.”

McCarthy said that Pelosi prematurely launched the impeachment proceedings without getting the evidence. “She should have waited 48 hours until she read the transcripts, until—she decided, she made a decision based on no facts,” McCarthy said.

McCarthy also explained that the House has voted on impeachment several times before—and each time it failed. He also laid out a timeline of how Schiff seems to have orchestrated this entire latest “hoax.”

“Remember, we’ve voted three times on impeaching this president,” McCarthy said. “Twice, the Democrats brought impeachment up before the Mueller report even came forward. They have no proof whatsoever, but they’re voting to impeach the president. Remember, the Washington Post just gave Adam Schiff four Pinocchio’s over the claim that neither he nor his staff had spoken to the whistleblower before he filed his complaint. What did we find? On Aug. 12, whistleblower’s complaint dated Aug. 12. On Aug. 28, Schiff tweets about withholding aid for the purpose of targeting a political opponent. Why would he know about that unless he talked to the whistleblower? Sept. 9, Schiff ordered a wide-ranging investigation. Sept. 17, he tells MSNBC ‘we have not spoken directly with the whistleblower but we would like to. But Schiff’s staff had already been in extensive contact. Sept. 19, Schiff insists to reporters that he doesn’t know the details of the complaint. Sept. 23, Pelosi decrees impeachment inquiry. Sept. 25, the transcript is released. Schiff worked with this whistleblower all the way through and lied to the American public, trying to create it, just as he did before when he lied to the American public claiming he had proof beyond circumstantial evidence [of Russian collusion]. This is the problem. This is a hoax.”

McCarthy said if the Democrats were interested in the facts and in being fair, they would have answered concerns he raised with Pelosi much more seriously and honestly—concerns that were instead brushed aside by the Speaker from San Francisco.

“If they truly believed in fairness, they would treat this president the same as we treated impeachment any other time—have an impeachment inquiry vote,” McCarthy said. “I sent a letter to Pelosi just along those lines with a few simple questions: Is she going to give the minority the same rights that the minority has been given any other time? We had coequal subpoena power, because right now we don’t. When we have those hearings, you know who controls who gets in the room? The Democrats. They can have all the people they want, but they limit the number of Republicans who can come into that room and staff others. Will they provide the president’s counsel the right to attend all hearings and depositions? Will they provide the president’s counsel the right to present evidence? Or what about to object? What about to cross-examine? Or what about to even recommend additions to the witness list?”

While Democrats are racing down the rabbit-hole of impeachment again, however, they continue failing to achieve any policy solutions for Americans whatsoever, McCarthy added.

“The only thing they’ve done are failed investigations,” McCarthy said. “Think of this. Here we are with the debate about China, where America is going to go, will we get fair trade, we have the USMCA—the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement—it’s been 300 days since the president has signed it. Mexico has already ratified it. Canada is waiting on us. Mexico and Canada in the last month became our number one and number two traders. The president is going to sit down with Xi Jinping of China in November. Wouldn’t it be smarter for America to have an agreement with our top two traders before we sit down with China? But, Nancy Pelosi has all the power to call USMCA up. She is more concerned about tearing down this president instead of building America up. What about prescription drugs? What about the crisis along the border? What about our veterans? All of that stopped because all they care about is impeaching the president. Every time we see it there is a common denominator. Adam Schiff is lying at the top to put America through a nightmare again with the very fabric of democracy that holds our country together. This has got to stop.”

The political backlash against Democrats could be intense heading into the 2020 presidential and congressional elections, and McCarthy seems to think it will be. After winning North Carolina’s ninth congressional district special election in September, Republicans only need to retake a net of 19 seats from the Democrats to retake the majority in the House. With, as McCarthy mentioned earlier in the interview, 31 Democrats representing districts that Trump won in 2016—13 of which Trump won by six percent or more—that seems a very realistic goal for Republicans in 2020.

“I don’t look at this from the aspect of making a political gain,” McCarthy said. “What I really think about is the republic itself and the fairness. But what I see out there when I listen to the Democrats on the other side is they’re very worried, and they should be. If you look, 63 percent of Americans do not believe anything in that phone call with Ukraine is impeachable. If you look at the majority of Americans, they don’t see anything that the Democrats have accomplished except the investigations. You have found that Pelosi told the American people if they gave them the right to be the majority, that they would be different—that they would govern different—but now we found out that was not true.”

If Republicans do take back the majority, McCarthy would presumably become Speaker of the House–something President Trump has signaled he supports:

Leader McCarthy, we look forward to you soon becoming Speaker of the House. The Do Nothing Dems don’t have a chance! https://t.co/uWPdGJg99F — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 3, 2019

McCarthy also said with Pelosi answering to the “Squad” of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), and others—as well as the rise of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), whom McCarthy now expects will be the 2020 Democrat presidential nominee—the Democrat Party is in leftist shambles, fractured to pieces by its leftist socialist flank, leaving a wide open lane for Republicans.

“We’ve watched these new socialist Democrats hijack the party, whereas I believe the only reason Nancy Pelosi agreed to an impeachment inquiry was the pressure from socialist Democrats,” McCarthy said. “Remember, AOC tweeted that weekend against the Speaker again—and then moved. Time and time again, many people believe she is only Speaker in name—she doesn’t have the power. When you look at the floor, she cannot pass anything because of this new AOC, Tlaib, Omar, and the others—and then think about who is going to be their nominee for president. It is going to be Elizabeth Warren. Elizabeth Warren’s philosophy and beliefs are out of step with the majority of Americans.”

5. Trump, unleashed: Donald Trump has spent the last week talking and tweeting almost nonstop as he tries to fight his way out of mounting allegations over his pressure campaign to get the Ukrainians to look into debunked allegations of wrongdoing against Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

And the rhetoric from Trump has gone to previously unseen heights -- even for Trump. He's accused Rep. Adam Schiff (California) of treason, he's attacked Mitt Romney in deeply personal terms -- more on that directly below -- and he's repeating, repeating, repeating long disproven lies.

All of which means that when Trump travels to Minneapolis on Thursday for a ""Keep America Great"" rally, well, look out. Trump is always at his most, well, Trump-y at these campaign rallies -- and, given the walls closing in on him in Washington, he could well use the Minnesota rally as a venting session the likes of which even longtime Trump observers rarely see.

Stay tuned. It's going to be a doozy.

4. Any other Mitt Romneys out there?: Republicans have, almost uniformly, closed ranks around Trump even as a Republicans have, almost uniformly, closed ranks around Trump even as a second whistleblower has emerged regarding the President allegedly using the power of his office for political gain during interactions over the summer with Ukraine.

Only Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) has publicly criticized Trump in any way, calling the President's urgings of China and Ukraine to investigate the Bidens ""wrong"" and ""appalling."" Trump immediately struck back, referring to Romney as a ""pompous 'ass'"" (I have no idea why he put ""ass"" in quotes) and suggesting that the 2012 Republican nominee was ""begging"" to be his secretary of state.

Any Republican who was weighing speaking out about Trump's behavior with Ukraine (and his plea for China to investigate his main rival for the 2020 nomination) now can have no illusions about what such criticism will be met with: Pure, unadulterated anger from Trump -- and likely vilification from the President's base.

Is any prominent Republican other than Romney willing to risk speaking out when that reaction is assured? Principle vs. politics, anyone?

3. Fundraising losers...: With the With the third fundraising quarter ending at the close of last month , most of the major candidates have released how much they brought in and how much they spent between July 1 and September 30.

Let's go through the losers first.

* Joe Biden: When you are a former vice president and the race's frontrunner, you need to be at or very close to the top of the money chase. Biden's $15 million raised in the third quarter is well off the pace and a significant drop-off from when Biden raised $21.5 million from April 1 to June 30 -- his first three months of active fundraising. His numbers will re-ignite the debate over whether he has real grassroots energy behind his establishment candidacy. Think about this: The mayor of South Bend, Indiana -- Pete Buttigieg -- raised $4 million more than Biden in the third quarter and has now out-raised the former vice president for six months straight.

* Cory Booker: The New Jersey senator's plea for $1.7 million in the final days of the quarter -- in order, he said, for him to remain in the race -- drew a ton of publicity. Even though Booker met his goal, he still only brought in $6 million for the entire three-month period. That likely means he will be facing another dire financial deadline in the not-too-distant future.

2. ... and fundraising winners:

* Bernie Sanders: Even as his poll numbers have stagnated somewhat, the Vermont senator's small-dollar, online fundraising network continues to deliver. Sanders topped the field in the third quarter with more than $25 million raised and has now raised more than $71 million this year. That ensures he will not only have real organizations in all of the early states but will also be able to continue fighting for the nomination for months.

* Elizabeth Warren: While Sanders edged out Warren for the top spot by about $500,000, Warren's third quarter fundraising is yet another data point proving how much momentum she has built behind her candidacy. Warren already has the best organization in Iowa, and fundraising like she put on the board over the last three months ensures her campaign will be able to fund a (TV) air assault as well.

* Andrew Yang: The tech entrepreneur raised $10 million in the third quarter, which, at least to me was the single most surprising result of the fundraising race. Yang's total put him well above what Booker, as well as Sen. Michael Bennet (Colorado) and Gov. Steve Bullock (Montana) raised, and within shouting distance of Sen. Kamala Harris (California). That's a stunner, and shows how far he's come since the year started and almost no one knew who he was.

1. The age/health debate is here: It was probably inevitable, given that the four most likely candidates to be president in 2021 are 70+ years old, but Bernie Sanders' recent heart attack has officially injected the issue of age and health into the 2020 campaign.

After several days of uncertainty, Sanders' campaign confirmed that he had suffered a heart attack on the campaign trail and, following his release from the hospital late last week, he has returned to Vermont. His campaign has canceled its events until further notice but has said Sanders will be at the next debate -- set for October 15 in Ohio.

While the relatively advanced ages of Sanders (78), Joe Biden (76) and Elizabeth Warren (70) has been a sort of low buzz in the background of the Democratic race so far, those days are now over. All three candidates had previously pledged to release their medical records before the Iowa caucuses on February 3, 2020, but the urgency of those releases is significantly higher now than it was even a week ago.

(Remember that Donald Trump was the oldest person ever elected to a first term when he won the presidency in 2016 at age 70. During the campaign, his personal physician released a letter proclaiming that Trump ""would be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency."" Trump is now 73. In January of this year, he underwent a physical which found him in ""very good health overall."")"
158,"Jeff Zeleny and Arlette Saenz, CNN",,Joe Biden has long wanted nothing more than this: a head-to-head matchup with President Donald Trump to show Democrats that he is the party's best chance of winning the White House.,2019-10-07,CNN,Joe Biden grapples with attacks from Trump and the rising Warren threat,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/07/politics/joe-biden-elizabeth-warren-ukraine-challenges/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Joe Biden has long wanted nothing more than this: a head-to-head matchup with President Donald Trump to show Democrats that he is the party's best chance of winning the White House.

But as his extraordinary battle with Trump enters its third week -- and the impeachment inquiry intensifies -- Biden is struggling to prove that point as he searches for the proper footing to fight the President without being sullied by the fallout. He's under siege by Trump and the explosive Ukraine investigation even as he tries to regain command of the Democratic primary race.

""I'm not going anywhere,"" Biden told donors this past weekend during a closed-door retreat in Philadelphia, a person in attendance told CNN -- a message he also delivered in a speech late last week and in a Washington Post op-ed aimed squarely at Trump. ""You won't destroy me and you won't destroy my family.""

At this critical juncture for Biden's candidacy, the official position inside the campaign is that this noisy feud with Trump elevates the former vice president's standing in the Democratic race.

Yet even his most loyal supporters and longtime advisers concede they can't be certain whether that's true, given the uncertainty surrounding the politics of impeachment and his fragile position in the primary fight.

""I'm not going to sit here and say there is no concern,"" a Biden confidant told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal campaign conversations. ""As this drags on, we just don't know. No one knows.""

Challenges ahead

For all of the planning and deliberations that went into his presidential bid, more than a dozen aides, donors and top supporters to Biden acknowledged in weekend interviews the campaign was entering almost entirely uncharted terrain as it grappled with the confluence of three distinct challenges.

First, the threat Elizabeth Warren's candidacy presents to Biden is more serious than ever. Not only did she announce Friday that she had outraised him by nearly $10 million over the last three months, she also has the ability to return to those grassroots donors again and again as she works to consolidate the party's progressive wing. Biden has been far more reliant on traditional fundraising, which places him at a distinct disadvantage among his leading primary rivals.

Second, the utter unpredictability of Trump and his attempts to draw Biden into the fray presents an unwieldy challenge. Biden does not want to get pulled into ""a mud fight,"" as he told donors last week in California, yet early attempts to respond to the President's bombastic claims left many senior Democrats saying Biden looked weak and imploring the campaign to ramp up its response.

Third, the injection of Hunter Biden into the fray complicates an already fraught private family dynamic. Despite unfounded allegations that the former vice president intervened to help his son in Ukraine and China, the campaign has struggled to respond to almost daily taunts from Trump and his followers.

Fighting a war on these three distinct fronts has awakened anxieties inside the Biden campaign and among his supporters. While Warren's ascendancy may typically spark the most worry in a typical campaign season, aides say she is almost relegated to the back burner, which could create challenges of its own.

""None of this is going away,"" said a senior Democrat official who admires Biden, but is troubled by the campaign's response to Trump. ""He needs to show more emotion and find a way to turn all of this into an advantage.""

Over the weekend in Philadelphia, dozens of Biden donors gathered for a tour of campaign headquarters and to receive an update on the state of the race from top Biden advisers, including campaign manager Greg Schultz and longtime adviser Steve Ricchetti. The event was scheduled long before the impeachment inquiry began, aides said, but, in the context of the drama unfolding in Washington, it took on a heightened sense of urgency.

After initially taking a far more measured approach to the crisis, Biden and his campaign have stepped up their attacks on Trump on multiple fronts in recent days, from paid advertising to fundraising appeals to more aggressive responses. The shift in strategy comes after the campaign received a fusillade of advice from Democrats watching in frustration.

""This campaign will continue to focus on the issues that impact people's lives,"" deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield wrote in a weekend memo, ""while simultaneously hammering Donald Trump for his unprecedented abuse of power and correcting the record on the mountain of lies Trump and his allies continue to spread about Joe Biden.""

Striking a proper balance between offensive and defensive moves -- juggling primary opponents and a potential general election rival -- has proven remarkably tricky. The challenges from Trump come just as more voters are tuning into the 2020 campaign and as Biden loses his frontrunner's advantage in on the race.

Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania said he had little doubt Trump was trying to weaken Biden's candidacy because Republicans would prefer to run against Warren or another candidate with positions far more liberal than Biden. He said Democratic voters should not allow Trump to hijack their primary campaign.

""The American people know Joe Biden and his character and values,"" Casey said in an interview. ""We should not allow Trump to change the subject and distract from a clear abuse of power.""

Warren was already a rising threat, but raising $24.6 million -- compared to Biden's $15.2 million -- sent alarm bells throughout the campaign and among top donors. Several Biden campaign officials used the fundraising comparisons, along with Bernie Sanders' $25 million haul, as a plea for donors to step up their efforts.

""Sanders and Warren have been building an online fundraising mechanism for six years. Joe Biden's been building one for six months,"" said Dick Harpootlian, a South Carolina Democratic state senator who has hosted a fundraiser for Biden. ""We've got to raise some money. His online efforts are getting better, but he's going to continue to have to do fundraisers which takes away from his time to campaign.""

On the policy front, advisers to Biden say they will gradually sharpen differences, particularly on Warren's support for the single-payer ""Medicare for All"" proposal. But they have no plans to use a scorched-earth campaign against the Massachusetts senator -- largely because they believe it would backfire -- and they hope other Democratic rivals will assume that role.

This week, Biden is traveling to New Hampshire, which will be a critical battleground between the two leading candidates.

""You know how difficult it is to be the frontrunner from the start and maintain that over time,"" said Lou D'Allesandro, a longtime New Hampshire Democratic legislator and top Biden supporter in the state. ""There are always ups and downs, but we're holding our own. And give her credit where credit is due, but by the same token, we've got to work harder.""

Biden's advisers have acknowledged Iowa and New Hampshire could be tough terrain for his candidacy, but they routinely emphasize his appeal in South Carolina, particularly among black voters in the fourth nominating state; A CNN South Carolina poll released last month found he had a huge lead over his opponents -- 37% over Warren's 16% and Sanders' 11%. His team is also building out its operations in Super Tuesday states, with announcements for key campaign organizers expected this week, in hopes of building a firewall in states with more minority voters to help slow Warren's momentum if she wins early contests.

""We have a broader base and coalition than anyone else,"" said Pete Kavanaugh, deputy campaign manager for Biden who is overseeing early-state contests. ""Once you get past South Carolina, it's a delegate game.""

But in conversations with more than a dozen campaign advisers and Biden loyalists, it is the subject of Hunter Biden that comes up again and again as the most worrisome aspect of the moment. He is seen by many inside Biden's orbit as something of the former vice president's kryptonite, who presents unique and uncertain challenges.

On the campaign trail, Biden's discussion of his son and his business dealings have been limited. Biden bristled at a recent question about whether his son's position on the board of a Ukrainian gas company -- at the very time the former vice president served as the point man on Ukraine in the Obama administration -- presented a potential conflict. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

""There has been no indication of any conflict of interest from Ukraine or anywhere else. Period,"" Biden told reporters, his voice raising. ""I'm not gonna respond to that. Let's focus on the problem. Focus on this man, what he's doing as President that no president has ever done."""

The New York Times was first to report the meeting on Sunday, noting the financiers were treated to a behind-the-scenes view of the campaign’s headquarters and strategy, including a private address by the former vice president.

“In a sign of the attendees’ significant financial firepower, Mr. Biden himself addressed the several dozen donors who came to the retreat on Saturday, rallying them for 45 minutes about the months ahead, people there said,” the Times reported. “The campaign kept the session with Mr. Biden behind closed doors, despite pledging to open them to the press.”

The meeting comes as the campaign is besieged by questions over Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine as well as polls showing the former vice president is no longer the frontrunner among 2020 Democrats. Biden, who once led the field by as much 26 percentage points, now trails Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire.

Adding to the campaign’s trouble is the fact that their fundraising numbers were eclipsed this quarter not only by Warren but also Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg — who polled significantly below the former vice president.

Biden’s mounting problems and the emergence of Warren as the most direct threat was not far from the minds of those gathered in attendance in Philadelphia.

“We need him to get the nomination because he’s the one who can win,” Denise Bauer, a Biden bundler and former ambassador to Belgium, told the Times. To stress the point, she added that the former vice president’s donors were “going to try to raise every single dollar we can.”

It is unclear if such efforts will be successful enough to save the 76-year-old Biden’s third White House bid. Unlike Warren or Sanders, the former vice president’s fundraising has failed to diversify past the top-dollar level. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, more than 2,800 donors have already maxed out to Biden’s campaign since his announcement in late April. Top-dollar donors make up a far higher percentage of Biden’s campaign’s coffers than those of his competitors.

In comparison, only 38 percent of the campaign’s funds to date have come from individuals donating less than $200. Such a ratio poses an issue for the former vice president, especially now that his top contributors are prohibited by law from donating again until after he’s secured the nomination. David Kochel, the former chief strategist for Jeb Bush’s failed 2016 presidential bid, explained the problem to Politico on Friday.

If you don’t have that perpetual, low-dollar fundraising machine, you can’t compete,” Kochel said. “Biden looks like he can’t compete with Warren, Bernie and Buttigieg. How’s he going to compete with Trump?”

Despite Biden’s money woes, the former vice president is also facing scrutiny over his son’s shadowy ties to foreign governments, which have taken center stage in the battle to impeach President Donald Trump. The controversy started last month when Trump suggested the Ukrainian government probe Hunter Biden’s role with Burisma Holdings. The younger Biden joined the Ukrainian oil and gas giant in 2014 around the same time his father was appointed to oversee Obama administration policy in the region.

As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden secured the position, which paid as much as $83,000 per month despite having no background in the energy industry or Ukraine. Hunter Biden’s lack of experience, coupled with his father’s influence over Ukraine, immediately raised questions from ethics watchdogs in both the U.S. and Europe about a conflict of interest.

Furthering the ethical cloud over the appointment is that it came during the same month that Mykola Zlochevsky, Burisma’s founder, had his assets seized in the United Kingdom for suspicion of money laundering. Some have speculated Hunter Biden’s ascension to Burisma’s board was an attempt by Zlochevsky to curry favor with western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of his business dealings.

A brazen attempt would not be totally ill-suited for Zlochevsky. The Burisma founder is rumored to be one of eastern Europe’s top oligarchs, a position obtained while serving in the Ukrainian government under former President Viktor Yanukovych — a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was during his tenure in government as Ukraine’s minister of natural resources that Burisma received its oil and gas licenses.

It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky’s legal troubles that Joe Biden’s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Biden, who has publicly bragged about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor’s ability to tackle corruption.

Unofficially, though, it was known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster he was warned to back off the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin’s successor dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky, allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having fled in 2014.

Biden, for his part, has refused to discuss the matter, even lashing out at the media for asking if his son’s work with Burisma posed a conflict of interest during his tenure in the vice presidency. The tactic, however, does not seem to be doing Biden or his campaign any favors. A new poll released on Friday indicates that 57 percent of Americans support the Department of Justice opening an investigation into Hunter Biden’s work abroad.

Some of the donors gathered in Philadelphia this weekend, though, saw the issues surrounding Hunter Biden and Ukraine in a different light. Sheila Nix, who once served as chief of staff to Dr. Jill Biden, told the Times the former vice president’s struggles were the result of him having to run two campaigns at once.

“He’s running a primary campaign and a general at the same time and I think he’s doing a great job,” Nix said. “It’s a little unprecedented having to do both at the same time.”"

The haul bests the $3.87 million the Minnesota Democrat raised in the second quarter of 2019, but is smaller than the $5.2 million that Klobuchar raised in the first quarter of the year.

Klobuchar's third quarter fundraising number pales in comparison to the $25.3 million that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders raised or the $24.6 million that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren brought in, and it will likely land Klobuchar in the middle of the 2020 Democratic field. But it is better than the $2.1 million raised by Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet and the $2.3 million raised by Montana Gov. Steve Bullock.

Like a number of her competitors, the senator raised her third quarter haul with a mix of in-person fundraising and online donations. Klobuchar's average donation this quarter was $29.78 and almost 90% of donor gave less than $100, her campaign said. The haul came from more than 105,000 donors.

Klobuchar, after launching her presidential campaign in February, has qualified for all three of the Democratic primary debates and will be on stage for the October debate hosted by CNN.

“Like the man who appointed him, Brett Kavanaugh should be impeached,” she continued, adding the hashtag “#ReclaimTheCourt.”

A tweet from Planned Parenthood inspired Warren’s plea. The abortion giant touted its mobilization effort and also vowed to “ReclaimTheCourt”:

The professor and member of Cherokee Nation, Joseph Pierce, said on Twitter Saturday that Warren staffers attempted to persuade him to vote for the presidential hopeful during a campaign drive. Pierce told one staffer that he was not happy with the way Warren falsely claimed Native American heritage, and noted that she had not “done enough to right the harm she has caused.”

The staffer told Pierce that he would get him in touch with someone “who could get the word to Elizabeth” and brought him to another staffer, whom Pierce described as a “white guy with a beard.” The professor told the staffer that he was Cherokee, but the conversation was seemingly cut short after the staffer asked for Pierce’s number so he could “make real time” for him.

“I say, ‘this really pisses me off.’ And then things change: he can see that I’m upset, and then tries to figure out if I am worth talking to after all,” Pierce wrote on Twitter, adding that the staffer ultimately said, “I’m not sure there is anything I can do for you.”

Pierce said he told the staffer, “Tell her, tell someone, that what she has done is not enough.”

He noted the fact that the staffer was not as interested in talking to him once he realized he had passionate thoughts on the issue.

“I mean, bro, just one second earlier you were willing to ‘make real time for me,’ and when you saw that I actually have thoughts about this, you no longer have that willingness or that time,” Pierce wrote. “That, my friend, is exactly the problem.”

Pierce added that the staffer told him that, by not voting for Warren, Trump would be re-elected. He called the staffer’s assertion “profoundly colonial.”

“This is the position they are putting us in, and it is profoundly colonial,” he assessed. “Profoundly”:

He says, ""I'm not sure there is anything I can do for you"". And it dawns on me, yes, I am upset, perhaps I'm not willing to have this conversation, perhaps I just want to yell.

Pierce blasted the “apology” Warren offered at the Frank LaMere Native American Presidential Forum in August, calling it “woefully inadequate”:

So, I didn’t expect Warren to spell out the complex history of Cherokee identity, the background of the allotment era and the theft of Indian land, identity, language, and culture by white settlers—including members of her own family. I didn’t expect her to be nuanced. But I hoped she might actually say, simply, that she is not and never has been Cherokee. That was my hope. And I was disappointed. Warren vaguely admitted wrongdoing. But she did not say what she did or why, quickly pivoting to her strong suit, public policy. This is a good strategy for courting people who wanted to hear her admit something. However, it doesn’t address the central issue at stake—Cherokee sovereignty.

“Like anyone who’s been honest with themselves, I know that I have made mistakes,” Warren told the crowd at the forum. “I am sorry for harm I have caused”:

Warren – who identified as a minority professor and listed herself as an “American Indian” on her Texas Bar registration card – has failed to go into detail on her false claims to Native American heritage, offering vague apologies and largely avoiding the subject. The results of Warren’s DNA test released last year revealed the presidential hopeful’s lack of Native American heritage.

As Breitbart News reported:

Warren has tried to put her claims of Native American heritage behind her, but a DNA test – taken last year – revealed that Warren had between 1/64th and 1/1,024 Native American ancestry. The results followed years of Warren’s claims of Native American heritage, citing her high cheekbones as physical proof. Additionally, the DNA results indicated an association with individuals from Colombia, Mexico, and Peru– not Native American tribes in the United States, further debunking her claims of Cherokee heritage, specifically.

A recently resurfaced video from Warren’s 2012 senatorial bid shows the lawmaker claiming to have “plenty of pictures” reflecting her Native American heritage but ultimately refusing to show them to the reporter.

“I have plenty of pictures,” Warren said. “They’re not for you.”"

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has made a habit of telling audiences at campaign rallies how she lost her beloved job teaching children with special needs at a public school when she became “visibly pregnant.” However a recently-unearthed video from 2007 suggests she left because she lacked the necessary education qualifications.

Warren’s biography has been central to her pitch to voters. For example, in Franconia, New Hampshire, in August — the town hall meeting that marked the start of her latest surge — she said (emphasis added):

I have known what I wanted to do since second grade. You may laugh — you didn’t decide ’til third grade, fourth grade. [Laugher] Not me, man. I have known since second grade: I wanted to be a public school teacher. Can we hear it for America’s public school teachers? [Applause] Oh, I knew — and I invested early. I used to line my dollies up and teach school. I had a reputation for being tough, but fair. [Laughter] I’m just kidding. I loved it, I loved it. And I never wavered from what I wanted to do. But by the time I graduated from high school, my family didn’t have the money to pay for a college application, much less to send me off to a four years at a university. So, like a lot of Americans, I have a story that kind of has a bunch of twists and turns in it. And here’s how mine goes. I got a scholarship to college — yay! — and then, at 19, I fell in love, dropped out, got married, took a minimum wage job. [Laughter] It was my choice, and it was going to be a good life. But it wasn’t a dream. I thought I’d given up on ever being able to teach school. And then, and then — I found it. I found a commuter college, 45 minutes away, that cost $50 a semester. And for a price I could pay for, on a part-time waitressing job, I finished my four-year diploma, I became a special needs teacher — I have lived my dream job! [Applause] Now do I have any special needs teachers here? [Applause] Oh, good — I’ve got some. Got some here. Fabulous. Back me up on this: teaching special needs is not a job, it’s a calling. And I loved it. I truly loved it. I still can remember the faces — I had little ones. Still remember their faces. And I probably would still be doing that work today, only my story has some more twists and turns. And here’s how the next twist goes. By the end of my first year in teaching, I was visibly pregnant. And the principal did what principals did in those days: wished me luck and hired someone else for the job. Okay, so I’m at home, I’ve got a baby now, no chance to get a job. What am I going to do? And the answer is: I’ll to go to law school!

Warren told a similar story at the last Democratic Party presidential primary debate in September (emphasis added):

By the time I graduated from high school, my family didn’t have money for a college application, much less to send me off to four years at a university. And my story, like a lot of stories, has a lot of twists and turns. Got a scholarship, and then at 19, I got married, dropped out of school, took a minimum wage job, thought my dream was over. I got a chance down the road at the University of Houston. And I made it as a special needs teacher. I still remember that first year as a special needs teacher. I could tell you what those babies looked like. I had 4- to 6-year-olds. But at the end of that first year, I was visibly pregnant. And back in the day, that meant that the principal said to me — wished me luck and hired someone else for the job. So, there I am, I’m at home, I got a baby, I can’t have a job. What am I going to do? Here’s resilience. I said, I’ll go to law school.

However, Warren’s current version of the story contradicts a version she told during a recently-resurfaced interview in 2007, when — as a Harvard Law School professor — she described her career path (4:42 to 7:49, emphasis added):

I’m of that generation where there were only two things that a woman could do if she wanted to do something other than stay home, and that was: she could become a nurse or she could become a teacher. And so there were some awfully able women who taught me from grade school on. And what they opened me up to was the possibility that I could become a teacher. And, frankly, that’s when I went off — When I went off to college, the whole idea was so that I could be a teacher. That’s what I wanted to do … I came to college on a debate scholarship. I was 16 years old when I graduated from high school. And I got a full scholarship in debate — that was room, board, tuition, books, and a little spending money. It was a fabulous scholarship. At George Washington University. If I would debate for them. It was sort of the equivalent of an athletic scholarship, only this was one that actually a girl could get, even though there weren’t very many girls in debate, either. I was going to be a teacher. And I quickly switched over and decided what I wanted to do was work with brain injured children. And so I got my degree in speech pathology and audiology, which meant that I would be able to work with children who had head trauma, and other kinds of brain injuries. And that’s what I did. .. I was married at 19, and then graduated from college, actually, after I’d married. And my first year of post graduation, I worked — it was within a public school system, but I worked with the children with disabilities. And I did that for a year. And then that summer — I actually didn’t have the education courses, so I was on an “emergency certificate,” it was called. And I went back to graduate school, and took a couple of courses in education, and said, “I don’t think this is going to work out for me.” And I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby, and I stayed home for a couple of years, and I was really casting about, thinking what am I going to do. … And so I went back home to Oklahoma … for Christmas, and saw a bunch of the boys that I’d been in high school debate with, and they’d all gone on to law school. And they said, “You should go to law school, you’ll love it.” And I said, “You really think so?” And they said, “Of all of us who should have gone to law school, you’re the one who should have gone to law school.”

There are consistent themes in these stories, such as that Warren wanted to teach children with special needs — as well as some puzzles (such as her claim that she could not afford to apply to college, then received a scholarship).

But there are also contradictions — and the most glaring is the different reasons given for her leaving her teaching job.

In the 2007 version of the story, the reason for her leaving her job was that she lacked the necessary education qualifications and was on a special contract — not because a male principal dismissed her for becoming pregnant. It was her subsequent studies in education, not discrimination, that convinced her to choose a different career path.

However, on the campaign trail, Warren has chosen to tell what Mediaite’s Tommy Christopher describes as a story in which “[t]he central idea has always been that she was living her dream of being a public school special ed teacher until some villainous Mad Men-era principal put the kibosh on the whole thing because of her baby bump.”

The program that interviewed Warren is called Conversations with History, a project of the University of California. The story about the contradictions appears to have been broken first by blogger Jeryl Bier, who in turn credited left-wing Jacobin magazine wrier Meagan Day, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, for the information.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), IBD-TIPP’s October poll shows.

The IBD/TIPP Poll – taken September 26 to October 3 among 900 adults (including a “subset” of 341 Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents) – showed the president edging out Warren in support from independent voters in a hypothetical general election matchup. While the poll shows Warren narrowly leading Trump overall – 48 percent to 46 percent – Trump leads Warren among independent voters by six percentage points, 49 percent to 43 percent.

Similarly, Trump leads Sanders among independent voters by four points, 48 percent to 44 percent. A head-to-head matchup shows Sanders surpassing Trump by three points overall – 49 percent to 46 percent.

Biden performs the best against Trump in a general election matchup – 51 percent to 44 percent – the survey found. However, his lead narrowed by five points from September’s poll, when he led Trump 54 percent to 42 percent.

In September, Biden saw an overwhelming amount of support from independent voters, 55 percent to Trump’s 37 percent. October’s results, however, signal a dramatic shift, with Biden narrowly leading Trump among independent voters, 46 percent to 45 percent. The poll’s margin of error is +/- 3.3 percent.

The survey also examined the Democrat primary field, which currently shows Warren leading the pack with one point over Biden, 27 percent to 26 percent. Sanders fell to a distant third with just ten percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with seven percent support.

The poll also showed another significant drop for Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who tied with Andrew Yang (D) for fifth place with just three percent support:"

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in the 2020 Democrat presidential primary would not prevent a scenario where a sitting vice president’s child is allowed to serve on the board of a foreign corporation, as former Vice President Joe Biden’s son did.

Released last month, Warren’s plan to “End Washington Corruption” seeks to end a series of loopholes where presidents, vice presidents, lawmakers, and their family members have been able to effectively sell influence to line their pockets — a scheme that the Clintons were famously accused of with the Clinton Global Foundation, and one which Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, are now accused.

In April 2014, as Breitbart News’ Haris Alic has reported, Hunter Biden was appointed to serve on the board of Ukrainian oil company Burisma despite having no qualifications do to so. At the same time, Biden led the Obama administration’s response to Russia’s invasion of Crimea, pushing billions of dollars in U.S. taxpayer aid to the Ukrainian government. Some of that money allegedly filtered out to Burisma, the corporation of which Biden’s son was a board member.

When asked last month whether her anti-corruption plan would prevent a case where a sitting vice president’s child could serve on the board of a foreign corporation, Warren evaded the question, saying “I don’t know.”

“I’d have to go back and look at the details on the plan,” Warren said.

A review of Warren’s anti-corruption plan, though, reveals that there is no explicit language preventing another case where a sitting vice president’s child can serve on the board of a corporation, let alone a foreign corporation.

The closest Warren’s plan comes to dealing with a Hunter Biden scenario is banning lawmakers and their staff from serving on the boards of corporations, domestic and foreign.

“My plan bans members of Congress and senior congressional staff from serving on corporate boards — whether or not they’re paid to do so,” the plan states.

While Warren’s plan would mandate presidential transition team members to disclose their involvement with corporations, foreign governments, and other potential conflicts of interest, this portion of the plan does not extend to members of an administration who later involve themselves in potential conflicts of interest.

“It also strengthens ethics requirements for presidential transition teams to ensure that those who are shaping our government disclose any conflicts of interest and comply with the highest ethical standards,” the plan reads.

Though the Hunter Biden question was asked of Warren almost two weeks ago, her campaign has yet to follow up on whether they would revise their anti-corruption plan to include banning the family members of sitting vice presidents from serving on the boards of foreign corporations.

MIT researcher Alexander Agadjanian published his latest research in the New York Times, where he revealed that swing voters likely are six percentage points less likely to vote for a Democrat against President Trump in the 2020 election after learning of the leftist policy positions they have embraced.

Agadjanian surveyed nearly 4,000 voters, showing half of them headlines where 2020 Democrats have endorsed decriminalizing illegal immigration, giving free healthcare to illegal aliens, ending private health insurance, and providing free college tuition for applicants.

The other half were shown headlines on general 2020 Democrat primary news, like when scheduled debates and townhalls are to occur. From there, the research found swing voters are less likely to vote for a Democrat when they learn of their policy proposals:

When deciding between Mr. Trump and the Democratic nominee, voters in the middle — the independents who could ultimately tilt things in Mr. Trump’s favor — became six percentage points less likely to vote Democratic after reading about the leftward turn compared with the independents who had read the innocuous content. [Emphasis added]

Likewise, the research found that there is no increase in mobilization to vote in the 2020 election for Democrat voters who learned of the candidates’ endorsement of leftist policies.

“Democrats who read about the leftward positions did not indicate they were more motivated to vote and campaign for the eventual nominee than those who hadn’t read about them,” Agadjanian notes.

As Breitbart News has chronicled, 2020 Democrats such as former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) have endorsed some of the least popular policy positions in the Democrat primary.

For example, the most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that a plan to give free, taxpayer-funded healthcare to all 11 million to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S. is the most unpopular policy position thus far. The plan was endorsed by Biden, Warren, Sanders, and the majority of other Democrat primary candidates.

Similarly, voters by a majority remain opposed to raising taxes on working and middle-class Americans in order to end private health insurance and provide “Medicare for All” to all U.S. residents. The plan to end private health insurance, endorsed by Warren and Sanders, has turned off American union workers as millions would have their employer-negotiated healthcare plans terminated should such a plan take effect.

“Depression over the current field was swirling through my head the other day,” Brown wrote in his latest column Saturday for the San Francisco Chronicle, before a portrait of Muhammad Ali had him thinking about a “rematch.”

“Think about it. Hillary is still the smartest of the bunch. She’s also better known than any of the candidates, so she doesn’t need a lot of money,” Brown argued.

“Clinton is the only candidate short of Barack Obama who has the brains, the battle-tested brawn and the national presence to take out Trump. And Obama can’t run.” he said.

Brown’s latest vote of no confidence in the current Democratic field echoes his earlier pronouncements. In February, he had already declared that none of the candidates — including his former girlfriend, Kamala Harris — could beat Trump.

The Democratic candidates “all have impressive credentials, winning personalities and positive messages, but none displays the “people personality” that our media-savvy president has mastered,” Brown wrote at the time.

The most recent Public Policy Institute of California poll showed Harris in a distant fourth among likely Democratic primary voters in her home state, while former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) were locked in a dead heat for first place.

“However, among voters with a candidate preference, more than half (53%) would consider supporting another candidate,” the PPIC poll added.

In an exclusive interview with SiriusXM Patriot’s Breitbart News Sunday, Miller said the 2020 Democrats’ open borders agenda of decriminalizing illegal immigration and forcing American taxpayers to provide free healthcare to illegal aliens is a “great crime against” working Americans.

LISTEN:

“When those Democrats raised their hands, what that said is, is that they’re willing to sacrifice the working class of this country to siphon off their funds and their healthcare to benefit illegal aliens who violated our laws and broke into our country,” Miller said. “It is a great crime against the working people of this country.”

“On the question of immigration, [the 2020 Democrats] are all indistinguishably supportive of open borders and mass migration and unlimited benefits for foreign citizens all across the world,” Miller said.

Miller is referring to the fact that the majority of 2020 Democrat candidates — including former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — said they would force Americans to provide free healthcare to all 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S.

As Breitbart News estimated, providing free healthcare to every illegal alien in the U.S. would cost up to $66 billion a year or $660 billion over a decade to American taxpayers. Already, Americans are forced to subsidize illegal aliens’ medical costs to the sum of almost $20 billion a year.

The Urban Institute’s Linda Blumberg, a health insurance expert, told the New York Times that such a policy providing free healthcare for every foreign national who crosses the U.S.-Mexico border or overstays a visa would drive a migration of “people with serious health problems” to the country.

On the other hand, Miller noted that Trump recently signed a presidential proclamation that protects American taxpayers from subsidizing the healthcare and medical costs of legal immigrants who want to permanently resettle in the U.S.

“The President issued an executive order … to simply say that in order to be lawfully admitted into our country, you must be able to afford or have a plan to cover your basic healthcare needs so that you and I and every other citizen in this country and every other person lawfully residing here today does not have to cover those health care expenses, that we will not use our healthcare system to subsidize all of planet Earth, which will mean rationing of care and denial of coverage for us citizens,” Miller said.

“We know that noncitizens are uninsured at a much higher rate than U.S. citizens and that bringing in large numbers of new noncitizens who have no means and no ability and no capacity financially to cover their health care costs means longer lines in emergency rooms,” Miller continued.

“It means fewer hours of time to see your doctor, it means less access to basic medicine, less access to basic procedures, it means less and worse care if that’s allowed to happen,” Miller said. “And so this is going to protect the availability of those benefits for U.S. citizens and persons today that are already living and residing here lawfully.”

The most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that the 2020 Democrats’ plan to give free, taxpayer-funded healthcare to all illegal aliens living in the U.S. is the most unpopular policy position thus far. Likewise, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) revealed recently that his research finds swing voters are vastly turned off by the open borders agenda pushed by leading 2020 Democrats.

In contrast, a majority of white, Hispanic, and black Americans said they support Trump’s latest regulation that seeks to ban welfare-dependent immigration — that is, legal immigrants permanently resettling in the U.S. despite having a record of using taxpayer-funded welfare programs.

Chuck Todd has always had a tough time accepting the results of the 2016 presidential, especially after he declared Hillary Clinton the winner a month before the votes were counted. And as a result, over the past three years, we’ve watched Todd beg then-House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) to impeach Trump, and then use BuzzFeed’s fake news to assure us Trump’s impeachment was guaranteed, and then break the North American speed record for spreading four lies in under a minute, and then completely buy into the Russia Collusion Hoax, and then, and then, and then, and then…

Basically, Trump broke Chuck Todd. In just a few short years, he went from being one of the smartest analysts on TV, to an afterthought, an asterisk; just another dishonest, left-wing operative with a TV hour to shriek about protecting “our precious norms,” even as he violates every journalistic norm to get Drumpf.

This Ukraine thing, though, has unglued Todd. He’s entered the face-melting stage, which began last week with this bizarre rant about how Trump is destroying democracy n’ stuff:

I don’t say this lightly. Let’s be frank, a national nightmare is upon us. The basic rules of our democracy are under attack from the president. We begin tonight with a series of admissions by the president that all but ensure his impeachment in the House of Representatives. It’s a moment of truth for Republicans, and they have been largely silent on what we have seen from the president. Today he publicly called on two foreign governments to interfere in the presidential election by investigating his chief 2020 political rival… This is arguably a national emergency. The Founding Fathers would consider it a national emergency if the president publicly lobbied multiple foreign governments to interfere in the next election.”

Here’s the full video. It’s hilarious.

What this is really about, though, is Todd’s emotional unraveling as the Ukraine Hoax unravels, and if you thought his “destroying democracy” panic attack was unhinged, watch Todd have a Sunday tantrum because Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) dares to talk about the Democrats’ documented collusion with Ukraine and Russia to sabotage the 2016 presidential election. Here’s the full video. Todd’s like a mailman about to run amok.

Believe it or not, that was not Todd’s worst moment Sunday. Watch the below clip of him with Obama’s CIA chief John Brennan, watch Todd nearly breakdown, watch how he can hardly control the shattered emotion in his voice:

—

So here’s why I think Todd is unraveling.

Just to be clear, this is a guess on my part, I have no inside-inside info, but I got the Russia Collusion Hoax correct from day one, so at least hear me here…

Weeks and weeks ago, Chuck Todd, his confederates in the elite media, and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) were all certain they had the smoking gun to impeach Trump.

We know Schiff knew about this phony whistleblower complaint well in advance, and my guess is that Schiff helped to write the thing in a way where it could only lead to Trump’s impeachment and removal. It is no stretch, then, to assume if Schiff knew about the phony whistleblower in advance, all of his pals in the media, like Todd, also knew.

My guess is that Schiff oversold what he had to the media, promised them Trump would be caught red-handed withholding U.S. aid if the Ukrainians refused to dig up dirt on Biden.

I also believe Chuck Todd, Jake Tapper, and the usual-usual Deep State bootlickers at the Washington Post, New York Times, CNN, and NBC News, all strategized with Schiff (and each other) to roll the whistleblower news out in the most damaging way possible. It was an on obvious shock and awe campaign. That was not by accident.

So imagine you’re Chuck Todd, and for weeks you’ve known for a fact that you Got The Goods On The Bad Orange Man This Time. And then…

You don’t.

And you don’t because the transcript of the call between Trump and Ukraine’s president was a big, fat zero; a bust, a nothingburger served on a nothingbun.

So here you are… The same Chuck Todd who bought all of Schiff’s lies about the Russia Collusion Hoax, and you have egg all over your frustrated face again because you bought his lies again. Instead of being a journalist, you let Schiff sucker you — again — into being a stenographer for the Democrat Party and the Intelligence Community. Yep, once again, you allowed your partisan wish-casting to get in the way of your integrity and professionalism.

Worse still — at least if you’re a Chuck Todd — it’s all backfiring. The only person getting killed politically by the Ukraine Hoax is Joe Biden, the best shot you had at unseating Trump.

The Ukraine Hoax is burying Biden.

He’s lost his lead to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who will be much easier for Trump to beat in 2020, and polls show that 57 percent of Americans want Biden’s Ukraine scandal investigated by the Department of Justice.

As far as Trump, all the Ukraine Hoax did was unite the Republican Party and boost Trump’s fundraising to unheard of highs.

Let me put it this way…

The Ukraine Hoax is unraveling so badly they are now trotting out a second whistleblower hoping for a do-over. Yes, the Julie Swetnick of this particular hoax is warming up in the bullpen.

And so, we’re finally at the point in the Roadrunner cartoon where Wile E. Chuckola grabs a hammer and starts pounding on his own head.

Democrats for Education Reform (DFER), a proponent of school choice, released the nationwide poll, conducted by Benenson Strategy Group, on Monday.

According to the poll results, 81 percent of Democrat primary voters, including 89 percent of black Democrat primary voters, support the proposal to “expand access to more choices and options within the public-school system,” including charter schools, which are funded with taxpayer dollars but operated by private boards.

In addition, when presented with a proposal to “put a nationwide moratorium in place to ban all federal funding for new charter schools,” only 44 percent of voters support it and 52 percent oppose it.

The poll states:

Voters know that a one-size-fits-all approach to education doesn’t work, and they support choices in the public-school system to make sure every child—no matter their background—has the chance to get a great public education at a school that puts their unique needs first.

The Benenson group conducted the poll in August-September 2019 using both phone and online interviews. Respondents were 1,721 likely 2020 voters, including an oversample of 1,227 likely Democrat primary voters. The poll’s margin of error is ±2.4.

The poll’s outcome places a spotlight on the vast disconnect between the education platform of the Democrat Party — one that remains closely aligned with the demands of the national teachers’ unions — and a plurality of its base.

Though several Democrat candidates were once staunch supporters of charter schools, as presidential candidates they have focused more on criticism of the Trump administration’s central education theme of school choice and of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.

As Education Week reports, Democrat candidates Joe Biden, Cory Booker, and Michael Bennet had all been supportive of charter schools prior to becoming presidential candidates.

In May, however, Biden said he will “not support any federal money for for-profit charter schools. Period.”

Bernie Sanders has been clear he would ban charter schools from being run by for-profit entities and would audit all existing charter schools.

Elizabeth Warren said, “Money for public schools should stay in public schools, not go anywhere else.” However, she praised the charter schools in her home state of Massachusetts as “successful, thoughtful, and innovative.”

Pete Buttigieg has said he would “take steps” to pull back on charter school expansion, while Julián Castro has said he would demand more “accountability” for charter schools than is required now due to the fact they are run independently.

Kamala Harris acted against charter schools when she was California’s attorney general and supported the Los Angeles teachers who demanded more rules for charter schools when they went out on strike in January.

Amy Klobuchar has said charter schools must meet “high standards” if they want to meet the definition of public schools.

Andrew Yang said, “I am pro-good school” during the last Democrat debate.

Beto O’Rourke has said for-profit charter schools should be banned, but, in June, said “there is a role” for them.

DFER states school choice is “in line with the Obama education legacy.”

“It’s no secret that our public schools need to be better funded, but that’s just the beginning of the story,” said Shavar Jeffries, president of DFER, and added:

The public sees that we need to more fairly fund underserved schools and pay teachers more who teach hard-to-staff subjects and serve in high-need schools. The poll findings are a call to action to continue the work started by President Obama and find ways to make our schools more equitable.

Left-wing groups, such as Planned Parenthood, the ACLU, and LGBT activist organizations, have muscled their way into charter schools in California. In 2018, the California Healthy Youth Act required comprehensive sex education (CSE) to be taught in charter schools as well as traditional public schools.

Meanwhile, some teachers’ unions have opened membership to charter school teachers. In December 2018, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and the American Federation of Teachers backed the nation’s first strike by charter school teachers.

However, officials from the Illinois Network of Charter Schools (INCS) criticized CTU’s involvement in the negotiations, saying the strike would restrict the independence of the charter school.

“If we accede to the idea that every unionized charter in Chicago has to have the exact same (working conditions), pretty soon we’re going to lose what the movement has contributed to the city — which is a vibrancy, a differential approach,” INCS president Andrew Broy said, according to the Chicago Tribune. “It would be a step backward for the city if we go down that path.”

The acceptance of charter schools in the education platform of the Democrat Party would likely mean a more robust attempt on its part to force charter schools to become more like traditional public schools under the banner of “accountability” for taxpayer dollars."

Adam Schiff (D-CA) from the Democrats’ “impeachment inquiry” of President Donald Trump.

McCarthy explained Schiff should now be considered a “fact witness” in the broader investigation of these matters given his and his staff’s role in coordinating with the whistleblower over the summer.

McCarthy said the pair of major revelations this week—first that Schiff’s staff met with the whistleblower before he or she reported concerns to the Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG), and second that the whistleblower concealed the Schiff staff meeting from the ICIG, as the ICIG testified this week—undercut Schiff’s ability to move forward with the investigation. As such, McCarthy said, Schiff and his staff should now be considered “fact witnesses” in the investigation—and Pelosi should formally sideline him, removing him from his chairmanship and having him recuse himself from an investigation it would be impossible for him to honestly oversee.

“Something very, very interesting came out yesterday and they control what happens—they’ll leak just a couple texts instead of the full transcript,” McCarthy said in an exclusive interview on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel this weekend.

“If the whole transcript was out there, you’d ask why go on with this investigation? Yesterday, we had the ICIG, which is the Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, in for a hearing. What we found out was he testified that the whistleblower never told him that he had already met with Schiff’s staff. Two things happen from that: It already goes to the political bias of the whistleblower. The whistleblower filling out the forms, there was a point there to put that in and [he] skipped it—did not want them to know, Schiff’s staff, that he had met with them yet. Nobody knows what was said with Schiff’s staff. Nobody knows if he met with Schiff, what they talked about, no one knows how many times they met. No one knows any about this except Schiff and his staff. Now, having done that, they are what is called ‘fact witnesses.’ When you are a fact witness, you cannot be a head of an investigation and be a prosecutor. No one in our judicial system would ever allow that. Why? Because Schiff and his staff should now be called in as witnesses. We need to cross-examine them. What did they talk about? What did you tell them? You can’t be in charge of the investigation too. This is such a hoax, every element of it, it goes against every basic fairness,” said McCarthy.

McCarthy added that the whistleblower’s decision to conceal the Schiff meeting from the Inspector General—and Schiff having lied about it to the public, which undercuts his credibility as chairman of the Intelligence Committee and as Pelosi’s lead investigator—casts a shadow of doubt over the Democrats’ already-hyper-partisan impeachment effort. Schiff’s broader history, McCarthy noted, is one filled with deceit and lies—dating back to when he falsely claimed to have “evidence” of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, something Schiff did not have and does not have.

“Even a greater point to make is that you went to the Intel Committee, then you went to the IG, and you did not tell them,” McCarthy said. “You withheld that information. Then when you had a form, you should have checked that you had done that, you did not check that form either. You made a conscious decision not to tell the IG that you had already met—and Schiff was asked this. Okay, let’s go through Schiff’s history, first he told America he had proof [of Russian collusion] beyond circumstantial. Well you know what? The millions of dollars and thousands of people looking at it—Mueller—could not find this fake proof that Schiff put America through a nightmare of for two years. Then we found out when they brought in Michael Cohen, his staff met with him how many hours? More than ten hours, three different times. We also found out later that Schiff also ran into Glenn Simpson—remember Fusion GPS?—and that he did not share that. Now, when he’s asked on television, he was asked on his own home television MSNBC does he know who the whistleblower is? He said no. He says, ‘I hope he comes forward, I hope he reaches out to us.’ He openly lied—numerous times.”

Specifically, McCarthy said the decision to allow Schiff to continue to lead the investigation lies solely with Pelosi—and he said that given Schiff’s clear dishonesty and lies, it is time for Pelosi to formally remove him from the plum Intelligence Committee chairmanship. Failure to do so, McCarthy said, could put America’s national security at risk given the fact that the Intelligence Committee handles America’s secrets. But leaving someone who should clearly be a witness not an investigator in an investigatory role, McCarthy said, undermines the credibility of the Democrats’ investigations—making them purely partisan.

“To be chair of the Intel Committee, it’s just one person to appoint: the Speaker of the House,” McCarthy said. “I appoint the Intel Committee on the Republican side. I don’t have to go through conference. The Intel Committee gets the top secrets that America ever sees, threats, and everywhere else. And this is a man who openly lies to the country to try to change the outcome of an election just because he doesn’t like the outcome? One, he should no longer be chairman of that committee. She should remove him. Two, he does not have the right to be the head of the investigation. It’s not the jurisdiction of his committee. But more importantly, he is a fact witness. He does not have the right to do that. If you believe in the rule of law, he does not have the ability to [lead the investigation]. Everything about this investigation proves it just is a political hack job to just try to go after the president.”

Schiff is hardly the only high-profile Democrat that McCarthy believes should be called as a witness in this investigation. He also said that former President Barack Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden, Biden’s son Hunter Biden, and other top leftists should also be called as witnesses for their roles in these matters.

“What I would to do is I would like to call Adam Schiff as a witness,” McCarthy said. ”I would like to call Hunter Biden as a witness. I would like to see Vice President Biden as a witness. I would like to see Barack Obama as a witness, since he put Biden as envoy to Ukraine. These are all things we are being denied because they have already written the script that they want to impeach this president, they want to discredit democracy, and they want to change the outcome.”

But for now, as the Democrats under Pelosi’s stewardship keep the “impeachment inquiry” as a partisan matter, McCarthy says, they continue to disregard norms and traditions when it comes to impeachment—further undermining their case, and driving the fight even more into partisan camps.

“In modern history, when they went to impeach Nixon, when they went to impeach Clinton, when they went to impeach two judges, there’s always been a process for fairness that you’d first have a vote to open an impeachment inquiry,” McCarthy said. “And why you would do that as the full body, they literally say it in the past as to why: This is such an important vote. If you are going to discredit democracy by doing this, you shouldn’t take it lightly. Everybody in America lends their voice to 435 members of Congress, so they should be heard on whether you move forward. What happens when you do that is they set the rules. In the Bill Clinton impeachment, there were 900 pages. They gave the minority subpoena power. They allowed the president to be able to know who the witnesses were, to object, to cross-examine, to do other stuff. Could you imagine going to trial and not being able to call a witness, not being able to cross-examine? So there’s two reasons why Speaker Pelosi is doing this. One, she doesn’t want to put her 31 members who are Democrats who sit in seats President Trump carried to cast that vote. Secondly, she wants to take advantage and not allow any fairness. She moved it out of Judiciary, which has the jurisdiction to do it, because she moved it into Intel. Why did she move it into Intel? Well, now we’re finding out—Schiff’s staff met with the whistleblower.”

McCarthy said that Pelosi prematurely launched the impeachment proceedings without getting the evidence. “She should have waited 48 hours until she read the transcripts, until—she decided, she made a decision based on no facts,” McCarthy said.

McCarthy also explained that the House has voted on impeachment several times before—and each time it failed. He also laid out a timeline of how Schiff seems to have orchestrated this entire latest “hoax.”

“Remember, we’ve voted three times on impeaching this president,” McCarthy said. “Twice, the Democrats brought impeachment up before the Mueller report even came forward. They have no proof whatsoever, but they’re voting to impeach the president. Remember, the Washington Post just gave Adam Schiff four Pinocchio’s over the claim that neither he nor his staff had spoken to the whistleblower before he filed his complaint. What did we find? On Aug. 12, whistleblower’s complaint dated Aug. 12. On Aug. 28, Schiff tweets about withholding aid for the purpose of targeting a political opponent. Why would he know about that unless he talked to the whistleblower? Sept. 9, Schiff ordered a wide-ranging investigation. Sept. 17, he tells MSNBC ‘we have not spoken directly with the whistleblower but we would like to. But Schiff’s staff had already been in extensive contact. Sept. 19, Schiff insists to reporters that he doesn’t know the details of the complaint. Sept. 23, Pelosi decrees impeachment inquiry. Sept. 25, the transcript is released. Schiff worked with this whistleblower all the way through and lied to the American public, trying to create it, just as he did before when he lied to the American public claiming he had proof beyond circumstantial evidence [of Russian collusion]. This is the problem. This is a hoax.”

McCarthy said if the Democrats were interested in the facts and in being fair, they would have answered concerns he raised with Pelosi much more seriously and honestly—concerns that were instead brushed aside by the Speaker from San Francisco.

“If they truly believed in fairness, they would treat this president the same as we treated impeachment any other time—have an impeachment inquiry vote,” McCarthy said. “I sent a letter to Pelosi just along those lines with a few simple questions: Is she going to give the minority the same rights that the minority has been given any other time? We had coequal subpoena power, because right now we don’t. When we have those hearings, you know who controls who gets in the room? The Democrats. They can have all the people they want, but they limit the number of Republicans who can come into that room and staff others. Will they provide the president’s counsel the right to attend all hearings and depositions? Will they provide the president’s counsel the right to present evidence? Or what about to object? What about to cross-examine? Or what about to even recommend additions to the witness list?”

While Democrats are racing down the rabbit-hole of impeachment again, however, they continue failing to achieve any policy solutions for Americans whatsoever, McCarthy added.

“The only thing they’ve done are failed investigations,” McCarthy said. “Think of this. Here we are with the debate about China, where America is going to go, will we get fair trade, we have the USMCA—the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement—it’s been 300 days since the president has signed it. Mexico has already ratified it. Canada is waiting on us. Mexico and Canada in the last month became our number one and number two traders. The president is going to sit down with Xi Jinping of China in November. Wouldn’t it be smarter for America to have an agreement with our top two traders before we sit down with China? But, Nancy Pelosi has all the power to call USMCA up. She is more concerned about tearing down this president instead of building America up. What about prescription drugs? What about the crisis along the border? What about our veterans? All of that stopped because all they care about is impeaching the president. Every time we see it there is a common denominator. Adam Schiff is lying at the top to put America through a nightmare again with the very fabric of democracy that holds our country together. This has got to stop.”

The political backlash against Democrats could be intense heading into the 2020 presidential and congressional elections, and McCarthy seems to think it will be. After winning North Carolina’s ninth congressional district special election in September, Republicans only need to retake a net of 19 seats from the Democrats to retake the majority in the House. With, as McCarthy mentioned earlier in the interview, 31 Democrats representing districts that Trump won in 2016—13 of which Trump won by six percent or more—that seems a very realistic goal for Republicans in 2020.

“I don’t look at this from the aspect of making a political gain,” McCarthy said. “What I really think about is the republic itself and the fairness. But what I see out there when I listen to the Democrats on the other side is they’re very worried, and they should be. If you look, 63 percent of Americans do not believe anything in that phone call with Ukraine is impeachable. If you look at the majority of Americans, they don’t see anything that the Democrats have accomplished except the investigations. You have found that Pelosi told the American people if they gave them the right to be the majority, that they would be different—that they would govern different—but now we found out that was not true.”

If Republicans do take back the majority, McCarthy would presumably become Speaker of the House–something President Trump has signaled he supports:

Leader McCarthy, we look forward to you soon becoming Speaker of the House. The Do Nothing Dems don’t have a chance! https://t.co/uWPdGJg99F — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 3, 2019

McCarthy also said with Pelosi answering to the “Squad” of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), and others—as well as the rise of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), whom McCarthy now expects will be the 2020 Democrat presidential nominee—the Democrat Party is in leftist shambles, fractured to pieces by its leftist socialist flank, leaving a wide open lane for Republicans.

“We’ve watched these new socialist Democrats hijack the party, whereas I believe the only reason Nancy Pelosi agreed to an impeachment inquiry was the pressure from socialist Democrats,” McCarthy said. “Remember, AOC tweeted that weekend against the Speaker again—and then moved. Time and time again, many people believe she is only Speaker in name—she doesn’t have the power. When you look at the floor, she cannot pass anything because of this new AOC, Tlaib, Omar, and the others—and then think about who is going to be their nominee for president. It is going to be Elizabeth Warren. Elizabeth Warren’s philosophy and beliefs are out of step with the majority of Americans.”

177,"Jeff Zeleny and Arlette Saenz, CNN",,Joe Biden has long wanted nothing more than this: a head-to-head matchup with President Donald Trump to show Democrats that he is the party's best chance of winning the White House.,2019-10-07,CNN,Joe Biden grapples with attacks from Trump and the rising Warren threat,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/07/politics/joe-biden-elizabeth-warren-ukraine-challenges/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Joe Biden has long wanted nothing more than this: a head-to-head matchup with President Donald Trump to show Democrats that he is the party's best chance of winning the White House.

But as his extraordinary battle with Trump enters its third week -- and the impeachment inquiry intensifies -- Biden is struggling to prove that point as he searches for the proper footing to fight the President without being sullied by the fallout. He's under siege by Trump and the explosive Ukraine investigation even as he tries to regain command of the Democratic primary race.

""I'm not going anywhere,"" Biden told donors this past weekend during a closed-door retreat in Philadelphia, a person in attendance told CNN -- a message he also delivered in a speech late last week and in a Washington Post op-ed aimed squarely at Trump. ""You won't destroy me and you won't destroy my family.""

At this critical juncture for Biden's candidacy, the official position inside the campaign is that this noisy feud with Trump elevates the former vice president's standing in the Democratic race.

Yet even his most loyal supporters and longtime advisers concede they can't be certain whether that's true, given the uncertainty surrounding the politics of impeachment and his fragile position in the primary fight.

""I'm not going to sit here and say there is no concern,"" a Biden confidant told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal campaign conversations. ""As this drags on, we just don't know. No one knows.""

Challenges ahead

For all of the planning and deliberations that went into his presidential bid, more than a dozen aides, donors and top supporters to Biden acknowledged in weekend interviews the campaign was entering almost entirely uncharted terrain as it grappled with the confluence of three distinct challenges.

First, the threat Elizabeth Warren's candidacy presents to Biden is more serious than ever. Not only did she announce Friday that she had outraised him by nearly $10 million over the last three months, she also has the ability to return to those grassroots donors again and again as she works to consolidate the party's progressive wing. Biden has been far more reliant on traditional fundraising, which places him at a distinct disadvantage among his leading primary rivals.

Second, the utter unpredictability of Trump and his attempts to draw Biden into the fray presents an unwieldy challenge. Biden does not want to get pulled into ""a mud fight,"" as he told donors last week in California, yet early attempts to respond to the President's bombastic claims left many senior Democrats saying Biden looked weak and imploring the campaign to ramp up its response.

Third, the injection of Hunter Biden into the fray complicates an already fraught private family dynamic. Despite unfounded allegations that the former vice president intervened to help his son in Ukraine and China, the campaign has struggled to respond to almost daily taunts from Trump and his followers.

Fighting a war on these three distinct fronts has awakened anxieties inside the Biden campaign and among his supporters. While Warren's ascendancy may typically spark the most worry in a typical campaign season, aides say she is almost relegated to the back burner, which could create challenges of its own.

""None of this is going away,"" said a senior Democrat official who admires Biden, but is troubled by the campaign's response to Trump. ""He needs to show more emotion and find a way to turn all of this into an advantage.""

Over the weekend in Philadelphia, dozens of Biden donors gathered for a tour of campaign headquarters and to receive an update on the state of the race from top Biden advisers, including campaign manager Greg Schultz and longtime adviser Steve Ricchetti. The event was scheduled long before the impeachment inquiry began, aides said, but, in the context of the drama unfolding in Washington, it took on a heightened sense of urgency.

After initially taking a far more measured approach to the crisis, Biden and his campaign have stepped up their attacks on Trump on multiple fronts in recent days, from paid advertising to fundraising appeals to more aggressive responses. The shift in strategy comes after the campaign received a fusillade of advice from Democrats watching in frustration.

""This campaign will continue to focus on the issues that impact people's lives,"" deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield wrote in a weekend memo, ""while simultaneously hammering Donald Trump for his unprecedented abuse of power and correcting the record on the mountain of lies Trump and his allies continue to spread about Joe Biden.""

Striking a proper balance between offensive and defensive moves -- juggling primary opponents and a potential general election rival -- has proven remarkably tricky. The challenges from Trump come just as more voters are tuning into the 2020 campaign and as Biden loses his frontrunner's advantage in on the race.

Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania said he had little doubt Trump was trying to weaken Biden's candidacy because Republicans would prefer to run against Warren or another candidate with positions far more liberal than Biden. He said Democratic voters should not allow Trump to hijack their primary campaign.

""The American people know Joe Biden and his character and values,"" Casey said in an interview. ""We should not allow Trump to change the subject and distract from a clear abuse of power.""

Warren was already a rising threat, but raising $24.6 million -- compared to Biden's $15.2 million -- sent alarm bells throughout the campaign and among top donors. Several Biden campaign officials used the fundraising comparisons, along with Bernie Sanders' $25 million haul, as a plea for donors to step up their efforts.

""Sanders and Warren have been building an online fundraising mechanism for six years. Joe Biden's been building one for six months,"" said Dick Harpootlian, a South Carolina Democratic state senator who has hosted a fundraiser for Biden. ""We've got to raise some money. His online efforts are getting better, but he's going to continue to have to do fundraisers which takes away from his time to campaign.""

On the policy front, advisers to Biden say they will gradually sharpen differences, particularly on Warren's support for the single-payer ""Medicare for All"" proposal. But they have no plans to use a scorched-earth campaign against the Massachusetts senator -- largely because they believe it would backfire -- and they hope other Democratic rivals will assume that role.

This week, Biden is traveling to New Hampshire, which will be a critical battleground between the two leading candidates.

""You know how difficult it is to be the frontrunner from the start and maintain that over time,"" said Lou D'Allesandro, a longtime New Hampshire Democratic legislator and top Biden supporter in the state. ""There are always ups and downs, but we're holding our own. And give her credit where credit is due, but by the same token, we've got to work harder.""

Biden's advisers have acknowledged Iowa and New Hampshire could be tough terrain for his candidacy, but they routinely emphasize his appeal in South Carolina, particularly among black voters in the fourth nominating state; A CNN South Carolina poll released last month found he had a huge lead over his opponents -- 37% over Warren's 16% and Sanders' 11%. His team is also building out its operations in Super Tuesday states, with announcements for key campaign organizers expected this week, in hopes of building a firewall in states with more minority voters to help slow Warren's momentum if she wins early contests.

""We have a broader base and coalition than anyone else,"" said Pete Kavanaugh, deputy campaign manager for Biden who is overseeing early-state contests. ""Once you get past South Carolina, it's a delegate game.""

But in conversations with more than a dozen campaign advisers and Biden loyalists, it is the subject of Hunter Biden that comes up again and again as the most worrisome aspect of the moment. He is seen by many inside Biden's orbit as something of the former vice president's kryptonite, who presents unique and uncertain challenges.

On the campaign trail, Biden's discussion of his son and his business dealings have been limited. Biden bristled at a recent question about whether his son's position on the board of a Ukrainian gas company -- at the very time the former vice president served as the point man on Ukraine in the Obama administration -- presented a potential conflict. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

""There has been no indication of any conflict of interest from Ukraine or anywhere else. Period,"" Biden told reporters, his voice raising. ""I'm not gonna respond to that. Let's focus on the problem. Focus on this man, what he's doing as President that no president has ever done."""

The New York Times was first to report the meeting on Sunday, noting the financiers were treated to a behind-the-scenes view of the campaign’s headquarters and strategy, including a private address by the former vice president.

“In a sign of the attendees’ significant financial firepower, Mr. Biden himself addressed the several dozen donors who came to the retreat on Saturday, rallying them for 45 minutes about the months ahead, people there said,” the Times reported. “The campaign kept the session with Mr. Biden behind closed doors, despite pledging to open them to the press.”

The meeting comes as the campaign is besieged by questions over Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine as well as polls showing the former vice president is no longer the frontrunner among 2020 Democrats. Biden, who once led the field by as much 26 percentage points, now trails Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire.

Adding to the campaign’s trouble is the fact that their fundraising numbers were eclipsed this quarter not only by Warren but also Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg — who polled significantly below the former vice president.

Biden’s mounting problems and the emergence of Warren as the most direct threat was not far from the minds of those gathered in attendance in Philadelphia.

“We need him to get the nomination because he’s the one who can win,” Denise Bauer, a Biden bundler and former ambassador to Belgium, told the Times. To stress the point, she added that the former vice president’s donors were “going to try to raise every single dollar we can.”

It is unclear if such efforts will be successful enough to save the 76-year-old Biden’s third White House bid. Unlike Warren or Sanders, the former vice president’s fundraising has failed to diversify past the top-dollar level. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, more than 2,800 donors have already maxed out to Biden’s campaign since his announcement in late April. Top-dollar donors make up a far higher percentage of Biden’s campaign’s coffers than those of his competitors.

In comparison, only 38 percent of the campaign’s funds to date have come from individuals donating less than $200. Such a ratio poses an issue for the former vice president, especially now that his top contributors are prohibited by law from donating again until after he’s secured the nomination. David Kochel, the former chief strategist for Jeb Bush’s failed 2016 presidential bid, explained the problem to Politico on Friday.

If you don’t have that perpetual, low-dollar fundraising machine, you can’t compete,” Kochel said. “Biden looks like he can’t compete with Warren, Bernie and Buttigieg. How’s he going to compete with Trump?”

Despite Biden’s money woes, the former vice president is also facing scrutiny over his son’s shadowy ties to foreign governments, which have taken center stage in the battle to impeach President Donald Trump. The controversy started last month when Trump suggested the Ukrainian government probe Hunter Biden’s role with Burisma Holdings. The younger Biden joined the Ukrainian oil and gas giant in 2014 around the same time his father was appointed to oversee Obama administration policy in the region.

As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden secured the position, which paid as much as $83,000 per month despite having no background in the energy industry or Ukraine. Hunter Biden’s lack of experience, coupled with his father’s influence over Ukraine, immediately raised questions from ethics watchdogs in both the U.S. and Europe about a conflict of interest.

Furthering the ethical cloud over the appointment is that it came during the same month that Mykola Zlochevsky, Burisma’s founder, had his assets seized in the United Kingdom for suspicion of money laundering. Some have speculated Hunter Biden’s ascension to Burisma’s board was an attempt by Zlochevsky to curry favor with western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of his business dealings.

A brazen attempt would not be totally ill-suited for Zlochevsky. The Burisma founder is rumored to be one of eastern Europe’s top oligarchs, a position obtained while serving in the Ukrainian government under former President Viktor Yanukovych — a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was during his tenure in government as Ukraine’s minister of natural resources that Burisma received its oil and gas licenses.

It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky’s legal troubles that Joe Biden’s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Biden, who has publicly bragged about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor’s ability to tackle corruption.

Unofficially, though, it was known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster he was warned to back off the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin’s successor dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky, allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having fled in 2014.

Biden, for his part, has refused to discuss the matter, even lashing out at the media for asking if his son’s work with Burisma posed a conflict of interest during his tenure in the vice presidency. The tactic, however, does not seem to be doing Biden or his campaign any favors. A new poll released on Friday indicates that 57 percent of Americans support the Department of Justice opening an investigation into Hunter Biden’s work abroad.

Some of the donors gathered in Philadelphia this weekend, though, saw the issues surrounding Hunter Biden and Ukraine in a different light. Sheila Nix, who once served as chief of staff to Dr. Jill Biden, told the Times the former vice president’s struggles were the result of him having to run two campaigns at once.

“He’s running a primary campaign and a general at the same time and I think he’s doing a great job,” Nix said. “It’s a little unprecedented having to do both at the same time.”"

Max Rose’s (D-NY) office over his newfound support of the partisan-fueled impeachment inquiry.

Rose – who represents New York’s 11th district, which Trump won by ten percentage points in 2016 – recently caved and announced his support for an impeachment inquiry.

“I will support and I will defend the United States Constitution, and it is for that reason that I intend to fully support this impeachment inquiry and follow the facts,” he told supporters at a town hall last week.

“I’m gonna follow these facts wherever they lead, no matter the consequences,” he added.

Protesters – who chanted “Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Max Rose has got to go!– swarmed his office on Monday alongside Staten Island GOP Chairman Brendan Lantry and New York State Republican Chairman Nick Langworthy.

“The president won this district by almost 11 percentage points, the people of Staten Island and Brooklyn and this district spoke loud and clear, (Rose) is going to face a wrath of those constituents next November, mark my words,” Langworthy said at the protest, according to MSN.

Lantry added:

Instead of focusing on doing his job and focusing on the important issues like improving our infrastructure, making New York competitive despite oppressive taxes and regulations, or lowering the cost of prescription drugs, Max fell in line with the most radical elements of the Democratic Party.

“It’s insulting the left is questioning our decision of whom we voted for,” one voter said:

“Max Rose’s constituents overwhelmingly voted to elect President Trump, but Max just can’t let it go: he’s absolutely obsessed with impeaching Trump and overturning his constituents’ choice in the 2016 election,” Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) spokesman Calvin Moore said in a statement.

“Max Rose has no intention of delivering on any of the issues voters elected him on, as long as he can team up with radical left for one more Hail Mary pass at removing Trump from office, no matter the cost,” he added.

Rose defended his decision to back the inquiry on Monday.

“I didn’t fight our enemies overseas so that our leaders would invite them to interfere in our elections back home,” he said.

“It’s disappointing to see the Republican Party put China and Russia ahead of America,” he continued. “My job is to get the facts, not play politics — and that’s exactly what I’m going to do.”

Rose is not the only lawmaker who has faced protests over support for the impeachment inquiry. Protesters surrounded Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) at the Reno airport last week, demanding her to “stop the impeachment” of Trump:

The haul bests the $3.87 million the Minnesota Democrat raised in the second quarter of 2019, but is smaller than the $5.2 million that Klobuchar raised in the first quarter of the year.

Klobuchar's third quarter fundraising number pales in comparison to the $25.3 million that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders raised or the $24.6 million that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren brought in, and it will likely land Klobuchar in the middle of the 2020 Democratic field. But it is better than the $2.1 million raised by Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet and the $2.3 million raised by Montana Gov. Steve Bullock.

Like a number of her competitors, the senator raised her third quarter haul with a mix of in-person fundraising and online donations. Klobuchar's average donation this quarter was $29.78 and almost 90% of donor gave less than $100, her campaign said. The haul came from more than 105,000 donors.

Klobuchar, after launching her presidential campaign in February, has qualified for all three of the Democratic primary debates and will be on stage for the October debate hosted by CNN.

Trump believed Ukraine was still rampantly corrupt and said that if President Volodymyr Zelensky wanted to meet with him, Giuliani would have to be convinced first, one source said.

""If they can satisfy Rudy, they can satisfy the President,"" a person familiar with the meeting said.

Trump's push to have Giuliani as gatekeeper is more direct than what was previously disclosed by one of the meeting's participants in his statement to the House last week. It also further demonstrates how significant Giuliani was in brokering access to the President regarding Ukraine policy and in passing messages to other administration officials.

CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.

A key accusation in the whistleblower's complaint that has prompted the impeachment probe into the President's dealings with Ukraine is that Giuliani, a private citizen, had been presenting to Ukraine a US policy different than that from US diplomats.

Their goal was to tell Trump that they had a favorable impression of Zelensky and his government, and that he was a reformer who Trump should trust and engage with, according to three sources familiar with the meeting.

They were hoping to set up a meeting between Trump and Zelensky, the sources said. They believed Ukraine under Zelensky was a more trusted ally than previous Ukrainian regimes, and that a visit between Trump and Zelensky could demonstrate to the Russian government that the US embraced a free Ukraine, according to two of the sources.

Notably, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was in Washington on May 23 but he did not attend the meeting with Trump.

Perry had led the delegation who attended Zelensky's inauguration, and was a central figure in the May meeting with Trump.

It became clear to the Trump administration officials, the sources said, that they would have to deal with Giuliani.

Volker hinted last week in speaking to the House how central Giuliani was in the President's foreign policy approach to Ukraine.

""The President was very skeptical,"" Volker said to the House committees, describing what had happened when he, Sondland and Perry spoke to Trump. ""In the course of that conversation, he referenced conversations with Mayor Giuliani.""

""He was clearly receiving other information from other sources, including Mayor Giuliani, that was more negative, causing him to retain this negative view "" of a corrupt Ukraine, Volker added.

The US officials then set out to correct the information feed coming into the President while realizing they would need to work with --and around -- Giuliani, according to the sources.

Two months later, during an interagency meeting, the Office of Management and Budget announced it would review whether Ukraine should receive $400 million in assistance from the US that had been set aside by Congress. The question on aid that arose later eventually became a major topic of conversation among Sondland, Volker and others.

Perry acknowledged speaking to Giuliani, according to an Energy Department spokesperson. The spokesperson didn't comment on the meeting itself or the substance of the conversations with Giuliani.

When asked if he had ever spoken to Perry about Ukraine, Giuliani responded by dismissing the question.

""Did Henry Kissinger ever call me about Ukraine,"" Giuliani wrote to CNN on Tuesday. ""What about Colin Powell.""

He then said that any information about his possible discussions with Perry would be privileged. He did not explain why."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) told CBS News in an interview published late Monday evening that she was, in fact, replaced in her teaching job in 1971 because she was “visibly pregnant,” despite newly emerged evidence otherwise.

Warren explained that the reason she told the story differently as a politician than as a law professor was because she had decided to “open up” about elements of her personal life that she had previously chosen not to highlight.

In a 2007 interview — first flagged by left-wing Jacobin magazine wrier Meagan Day, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America — Warren said that she chose to leave her teaching job as a speech pathologist for disabled children in a public school primarily because she lacked the necessary educational qualifications. “And I went back to graduate school, and took a couple of courses in education, and said, ‘I don’t think this is going to work out for me.'” She added: “And I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby, and I stayed home for a couple of years.”

That account appears to be supported by county school board minutes published Monday by the Washington Free Beacon, which report that Warren’s part-time teaching job as a substitute teacher had been unanimously extended for a second year, and that her decision later to resign from the post had been accepted by the board “with regret.”

CBS news found further evidence that Warren had left her position voluntarily: “Local newspaper reports from 1971 also present reasons for her leaving the school alternative to what she describes on the trail. The Paterson News, a local paper, reported that summer that Warren was ‘leaving to raise a family.’ The next month, a story about the school board hiring a replacement said Warren had ‘resigned for personal reasons,’ even though the board had voted to ‘appoint’ Warren to the same speech pathology job that April, according to an earlier report.”

However, CBS News also found evidence that might lend weight to Warren’s claims.

Two retired teachers from the same school district who did not remember Warren said, according to CBS News, that they “don’t remember anyone being explicitly fired due to pregnancy during their time at the school.” However, they added that “a non-tenured, pregnant employee like Warren would have had little job security,” reporters Zak Hudak and Bo Erickson noted.

One teacher recalled: “The rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant. Now, if you didn’t tell anybody you were pregnant, and they didn’t know, you could fudge it and try to stay on a little bit longer. … But they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant.” Pregnant teachers did not enjoy protection from discrimination in New Jersey until the passage of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978, and the school board was all-male, CBS adds.

Warren told CBS News: “All I know is I was 22 years old, I was 6 months pregnant, and the job that I had been promised for the next year was going to someone else. The principal said they were going to hire someone else for my job.”

The “all I know” phrase is familiar from Warren’s apology for claiming, falsely, that she was Native American: “All I know is, during this time period this is consistent with what I did because it was based on my understanding from my family’s stories. But family stories are not the same as tribal citizenship and this why I have apologized,” she said in February 2019.

In both cases Warren suggested that any factual inconsistencies were inadvertent.

The Free Beacon’s Collin Anderson reported:

RIVERDALE, N.J.—The Riverdale Board of Education approved a second-year teaching contract for a young Elizabeth Warren, documents show, contradicting the Democratic presidential candidate’s repeated claims that she was asked not to return to teaching after a single year because she was “visibly pregnant.” Minutes of an April 21, 1971, Riverdale Board of Education meeting obtained by the Washington Free Beacon show that the board voted unanimously on a motion to extend Warren a “2nd year” contract for a two-days-per-week teaching job. That job is similar to the one she held the previous year, her first year of teaching. Minutes from a board meeting held two months later, on June 16, 1971, indicate that Warren’s resignation was “accepted with regret.”

In fact, the minutes show that far from being fired, Warren had been unanimously approved for a second year:

The minutes also confirm a key detail from the 2007 interview: namely, that Warren was hired on an “emergency” basis because she lacked the necessary education qualifications, despite graduating from George Washington University with a degree in speech pathology, and supposedly pursuing a lifelong dream of being a public school teacher.

In the course of her presidential campaign, Warren has repeatedly told the nation a very different story — one in which an old-fashioned male principal discriminated against her because of her pregnancy.

In the second presidential debate in Detroit, for example, Warren said: “[A]t the end of that first year, I was visibly pregnant. And back in the day, that meant that the principal said to me — wished me luck and hired someone else for the job.”

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Sunday called for the U.S. to “reclaim the court” and impeach Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

Sunday – October 6 – marked the one-year anniversary of Kavanaugh’s confirmation. The Massachusetts senator and presidential hopeful marked the occasion by calling for his impeachment.

“Americans will lose trust in our judicial system if they no longer believe that our judges will be held to the highest ethical standards,” Warren wrote.

“Like the man who appointed him, Brett Kavanaugh should be impeached,” she continued, adding the hashtag “#ReclaimTheCourt.”

A tweet from Planned Parenthood inspired Warren’s plea. The abortion giant touted its mobilization effort and also vowed to “ReclaimTheCourt”:

This is far from the first time Warren has expressed her desire to impeach Kavanaugh. She commemorated the one-year anniversary of Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony last week, writing, “I still believe Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. And like the man who appointed him, Brett Kavanaugh should be impeached”:

Anti-Kavanaugh protesters took to the streets in Washington, DC, on Sunday to protest Kavanaugh’s position on the Supreme Court.

“Today, we’re here to tell Congress there’s no place for predators on our courts,” one student at the protest declared, adding that it is “time to put Brett Kavanaugh out on the street.”

Several activists took their demonstration to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-KY) house, chanting “unfit to sit” and covering the Kentucky senator’s door with caution tape."

Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) campaign dismissed his concerns that Warren had not done enough to “right the harm she has caused” by falsely claiming Cherokee heritage for years, and added that the staffer’s claim – that Trump will be re-elected if he does not support Warren – is “profoundly colonial.”

The professor and member of Cherokee Nation, Joseph Pierce, said on Twitter Saturday that Warren staffers attempted to persuade him to vote for the presidential hopeful during a campaign drive. Pierce told one staffer that he was not happy with the way Warren falsely claimed Native American heritage, and noted that she had not “done enough to right the harm she has caused.”

The staffer told Pierce that he would get him in touch with someone “who could get the word to Elizabeth” and brought him to another staffer, whom Pierce described as a “white guy with a beard.” The professor told the staffer that he was Cherokee, but the conversation was seemingly cut short after the staffer asked for Pierce’s number so he could “make real time” for him.

“I say, ‘this really pisses me off.’ And then things change: he can see that I’m upset, and then tries to figure out if I am worth talking to after all,” Pierce wrote on Twitter, adding that the staffer ultimately said, “I’m not sure there is anything I can do for you.”

Pierce said he told the staffer, “Tell her, tell someone, that what she has done is not enough.”

He noted the fact that the staffer was not as interested in talking to him once he realized he had passionate thoughts on the issue.

“I mean, bro, just one second earlier you were willing to ‘make real time for me,’ and when you saw that I actually have thoughts about this, you no longer have that willingness or that time,” Pierce wrote. “That, my friend, is exactly the problem.”

Pierce added that the staffer told him that, by not voting for Warren, Trump would be re-elected. He called the staffer’s assertion “profoundly colonial.”

“This is the position they are putting us in, and it is profoundly colonial,” he assessed. “Profoundly”:

He says, ""I'm not sure there is anything I can do for you"". And it dawns on me, yes, I am upset, perhaps I'm not willing to have this conversation, perhaps I just want to yell.

Pierce blasted the “apology” Warren offered at the Frank LaMere Native American Presidential Forum in August, calling it “woefully inadequate”:

So, I didn’t expect Warren to spell out the complex history of Cherokee identity, the background of the allotment era and the theft of Indian land, identity, language, and culture by white settlers—including members of her own family. I didn’t expect her to be nuanced. But I hoped she might actually say, simply, that she is not and never has been Cherokee. That was my hope. And I was disappointed. Warren vaguely admitted wrongdoing. But she did not say what she did or why, quickly pivoting to her strong suit, public policy. This is a good strategy for courting people who wanted to hear her admit something. However, it doesn’t address the central issue at stake—Cherokee sovereignty.

“Like anyone who’s been honest with themselves, I know that I have made mistakes,” Warren told the crowd at the forum. “I am sorry for harm I have caused”:

Warren – who identified as a minority professor and listed herself as an “American Indian” on her Texas Bar registration card – has failed to go into detail on her false claims to Native American heritage, offering vague apologies and largely avoiding the subject. The results of Warren’s DNA test released last year revealed the presidential hopeful’s lack of Native American heritage.

As Breitbart News reported:

Warren has tried to put her claims of Native American heritage behind her, but a DNA test – taken last year – revealed that Warren had between 1/64th and 1/1,024 Native American ancestry. The results followed years of Warren’s claims of Native American heritage, citing her high cheekbones as physical proof. Additionally, the DNA results indicated an association with individuals from Colombia, Mexico, and Peru– not Native American tribes in the United States, further debunking her claims of Cherokee heritage, specifically.

A recently resurfaced video from Warren’s 2012 senatorial bid shows the lawmaker claiming to have “plenty of pictures” reflecting her Native American heritage but ultimately refusing to show them to the reporter.

“I have plenty of pictures,” Warren said. “They’re not for you.”"

The IBD/TIPP Poll – taken September 26 to October 3 among 900 adults (including a “subset” of 341 Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents) – showed the president edging out Warren in support from independent voters in a hypothetical general election matchup. While the poll shows Warren narrowly leading Trump overall – 48 percent to 46 percent – Trump leads Warren among independent voters by six percentage points, 49 percent to 43 percent.

Similarly, Trump leads Sanders among independent voters by four points, 48 percent to 44 percent. A head-to-head matchup shows Sanders surpassing Trump by three points overall – 49 percent to 46 percent.

Biden performs the best against Trump in a general election matchup – 51 percent to 44 percent – the survey found. However, his lead narrowed by five points from September’s poll, when he led Trump 54 percent to 42 percent.

In September, Biden saw an overwhelming amount of support from independent voters, 55 percent to Trump’s 37 percent. October’s results, however, signal a dramatic shift, with Biden narrowly leading Trump among independent voters, 46 percent to 45 percent. The poll’s margin of error is +/- 3.3 percent.

The survey also examined the Democrat primary field, which currently shows Warren leading the pack with one point over Biden, 27 percent to 26 percent. Sanders fell to a distant third with just ten percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with seven percent support.

The poll also showed another significant drop for Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who tied with Andrew Yang (D) for fifth place with just three percent support:"

In an exclusive interview with SiriusXM Patriot’s Breitbart News Sunday, Miller said the 2020 Democrats’ open borders agenda of decriminalizing illegal immigration and forcing American taxpayers to provide free healthcare to illegal aliens is a “great crime against” working Americans.

LISTEN:

“When those Democrats raised their hands, what that said is, is that they’re willing to sacrifice the working class of this country to siphon off their funds and their healthcare to benefit illegal aliens who violated our laws and broke into our country,” Miller said. “It is a great crime against the working people of this country.”

“On the question of immigration, [the 2020 Democrats] are all indistinguishably supportive of open borders and mass migration and unlimited benefits for foreign citizens all across the world,” Miller said.

Miller is referring to the fact that the majority of 2020 Democrat candidates — including former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — said they would force Americans to provide free healthcare to all 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S.

As Breitbart News estimated, providing free healthcare to every illegal alien in the U.S. would cost up to $66 billion a year or $660 billion over a decade to American taxpayers. Already, Americans are forced to subsidize illegal aliens’ medical costs to the sum of almost $20 billion a year.

The Urban Institute’s Linda Blumberg, a health insurance expert, told the New York Times that such a policy providing free healthcare for every foreign national who crosses the U.S.-Mexico border or overstays a visa would drive a migration of “people with serious health problems” to the country.

On the other hand, Miller noted that Trump recently signed a presidential proclamation that protects American taxpayers from subsidizing the healthcare and medical costs of legal immigrants who want to permanently resettle in the U.S.

“The President issued an executive order … to simply say that in order to be lawfully admitted into our country, you must be able to afford or have a plan to cover your basic healthcare needs so that you and I and every other citizen in this country and every other person lawfully residing here today does not have to cover those health care expenses, that we will not use our healthcare system to subsidize all of planet Earth, which will mean rationing of care and denial of coverage for us citizens,” Miller said.

“We know that noncitizens are uninsured at a much higher rate than U.S. citizens and that bringing in large numbers of new noncitizens who have no means and no ability and no capacity financially to cover their health care costs means longer lines in emergency rooms,” Miller continued.

“It means fewer hours of time to see your doctor, it means less access to basic medicine, less access to basic procedures, it means less and worse care if that’s allowed to happen,” Miller said. “And so this is going to protect the availability of those benefits for U.S. citizens and persons today that are already living and residing here lawfully.”

The most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that the 2020 Democrats’ plan to give free, taxpayer-funded healthcare to all illegal aliens living in the U.S. is the most unpopular policy position thus far. Likewise, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) revealed recently that his research finds swing voters are vastly turned off by the open borders agenda pushed by leading 2020 Democrats.

In contrast, a majority of white, Hispanic, and black Americans said they support Trump’s latest regulation that seeks to ban welfare-dependent immigration — that is, legal immigrants permanently resettling in the U.S. despite having a record of using taxpayer-funded welfare programs.

Chuck Todd has always had a tough time accepting the results of the 2016 presidential, especially after he declared Hillary Clinton the winner a month before the votes were counted. And as a result, over the past three years, we’ve watched Todd beg then-House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) to impeach Trump, and then use BuzzFeed’s fake news to assure us Trump’s impeachment was guaranteed, and then break the North American speed record for spreading four lies in under a minute, and then completely buy into the Russia Collusion Hoax, and then, and then, and then, and then…

Basically, Trump broke Chuck Todd. In just a few short years, he went from being one of the smartest analysts on TV, to an afterthought, an asterisk; just another dishonest, left-wing operative with a TV hour to shriek about protecting “our precious norms,” even as he violates every journalistic norm to get Drumpf.

This Ukraine thing, though, has unglued Todd. He’s entered the face-melting stage, which began last week with this bizarre rant about how Trump is destroying democracy n’ stuff:

I don’t say this lightly. Let’s be frank, a national nightmare is upon us. The basic rules of our democracy are under attack from the president. We begin tonight with a series of admissions by the president that all but ensure his impeachment in the House of Representatives. It’s a moment of truth for Republicans, and they have been largely silent on what we have seen from the president. Today he publicly called on two foreign governments to interfere in the presidential election by investigating his chief 2020 political rival… This is arguably a national emergency. The Founding Fathers would consider it a national emergency if the president publicly lobbied multiple foreign governments to interfere in the next election.”

Here’s the full video. It’s hilarious.

What this is really about, though, is Todd’s emotional unraveling as the Ukraine Hoax unravels, and if you thought his “destroying democracy” panic attack was unhinged, watch Todd have a Sunday tantrum because Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) dares to talk about the Democrats’ documented collusion with Ukraine and Russia to sabotage the 2016 presidential election. Here’s the full video. Todd’s like a mailman about to run amok.

Believe it or not, that was not Todd’s worst moment Sunday. Watch the below clip of him with Obama’s CIA chief John Brennan, watch Todd nearly breakdown, watch how he can hardly control the shattered emotion in his voice:

—

So here’s why I think Todd is unraveling.

Just to be clear, this is a guess on my part, I have no inside-inside info, but I got the Russia Collusion Hoax correct from day one, so at least hear me here…

Weeks and weeks ago, Chuck Todd, his confederates in the elite media, and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) were all certain they had the smoking gun to impeach Trump.

We know Schiff knew about this phony whistleblower complaint well in advance, and my guess is that Schiff helped to write the thing in a way where it could only lead to Trump’s impeachment and removal. It is no stretch, then, to assume if Schiff knew about the phony whistleblower in advance, all of his pals in the media, like Todd, also knew.

My guess is that Schiff oversold what he had to the media, promised them Trump would be caught red-handed withholding U.S. aid if the Ukrainians refused to dig up dirt on Biden.

I also believe Chuck Todd, Jake Tapper, and the usual-usual Deep State bootlickers at the Washington Post, New York Times, CNN, and NBC News, all strategized with Schiff (and each other) to roll the whistleblower news out in the most damaging way possible. It was an on obvious shock and awe campaign. That was not by accident.

So imagine you’re Chuck Todd, and for weeks you’ve known for a fact that you Got The Goods On The Bad Orange Man This Time. And then…

You don’t.

And you don’t because the transcript of the call between Trump and Ukraine’s president was a big, fat zero; a bust, a nothingburger served on a nothingbun.

So here you are… The same Chuck Todd who bought all of Schiff’s lies about the Russia Collusion Hoax, and you have egg all over your frustrated face again because you bought his lies again. Instead of being a journalist, you let Schiff sucker you — again — into being a stenographer for the Democrat Party and the Intelligence Community. Yep, once again, you allowed your partisan wish-casting to get in the way of your integrity and professionalism.

Worse still — at least if you’re a Chuck Todd — it’s all backfiring. The only person getting killed politically by the Ukraine Hoax is Joe Biden, the best shot you had at unseating Trump.

The Ukraine Hoax is burying Biden.

He’s lost his lead to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who will be much easier for Trump to beat in 2020, and polls show that 57 percent of Americans want Biden’s Ukraine scandal investigated by the Department of Justice.

As far as Trump, all the Ukraine Hoax did was unite the Republican Party and boost Trump’s fundraising to unheard of highs.

Let me put it this way…

The Ukraine Hoax is unraveling so badly they are now trotting out a second whistleblower hoping for a do-over. Yes, the Julie Swetnick of this particular hoax is warming up in the bullpen.

And so, we’re finally at the point in the Roadrunner cartoon where Wile E. Chuckola grabs a hammer and starts pounding on his own head.

Kamala Harris (D-CA) on Monday unveiled one of the most aggressive family-leave proposals to date, featuring six months of taxpayer-funded family and medical leave.

Harris, who is floundering in both national and early primary state polls, has switched her campaign strategy on issues that “keep families up at night,” dubbing it a “3 a.m. agenda.”

Under Harris’s proposal, every worker that makes less than $75,000 per year would be entitled to full wages during the six-month absence, which is three months longer than proposals pushed by Democrat lawmakers like Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). Higher earners would also receive compensation, but less than Americans under the outlined threshold.

The plan would allow workers to take advantage of the benefit outside of traditional childcare or medical-related issues and could apply to “chosen family.”

Politico reports:

For example, Harris’ campaign said that a parent could take leave to care for a child harmed by domestic violence. It wouldn’t be limited to immediate family — workers could take leave to care for domestic partners, parents-in-law and ‘chosen family,’ among others.

The benefits would extend to part-time workers, independent contractors, and self-employed workers as well.

Harris’s plan also calls for the passage of the Child Care for Working Families Act and pledges to “create a federal inter-agency working group tasked with cutting child poverty by 50 percent in her first term.” She also calls for the expansion of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program, or “food stamps.”

Harris plans to pay for her massive family leave proposal with “new payroll taxes on employers and employees in addition to unspecified ‘general revenues,'” as well as “fines on corporations that fail to narrow their gender-based pay gaps,” Politico reports.

The proposal comes in the wake of Harris’s continued struggle to gain support in polls. IBD-TIPP’s October poll showed the presidential hopeful dropping to fifth place nationally, with just three percent support:

Democrats for Education Reform (DFER), a proponent of school choice, released the nationwide poll, conducted by Benenson Strategy Group, on Monday.

According to the poll results, 81 percent of Democrat primary voters, including 89 percent of black Democrat primary voters, support the proposal to “expand access to more choices and options within the public-school system,” including charter schools, which are funded with taxpayer dollars but operated by private boards.

In addition, when presented with a proposal to “put a nationwide moratorium in place to ban all federal funding for new charter schools,” only 44 percent of voters support it and 52 percent oppose it.

The poll states:

Voters know that a one-size-fits-all approach to education doesn’t work, and they support choices in the public-school system to make sure every child—no matter their background—has the chance to get a great public education at a school that puts their unique needs first.

The Benenson group conducted the poll in August-September 2019 using both phone and online interviews. Respondents were 1,721 likely 2020 voters, including an oversample of 1,227 likely Democrat primary voters. The poll’s margin of error is ±2.4.

The poll’s outcome places a spotlight on the vast disconnect between the education platform of the Democrat Party — one that remains closely aligned with the demands of the national teachers’ unions — and a plurality of its base.

Though several Democrat candidates were once staunch supporters of charter schools, as presidential candidates they have focused more on criticism of the Trump administration’s central education theme of school choice and of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.

As Education Week reports, Democrat candidates Joe Biden, Cory Booker, and Michael Bennet had all been supportive of charter schools prior to becoming presidential candidates.

In May, however, Biden said he will “not support any federal money for for-profit charter schools. Period.”

Bernie Sanders has been clear he would ban charter schools from being run by for-profit entities and would audit all existing charter schools.

Elizabeth Warren said, “Money for public schools should stay in public schools, not go anywhere else.” However, she praised the charter schools in her home state of Massachusetts as “successful, thoughtful, and innovative.”

Pete Buttigieg has said he would “take steps” to pull back on charter school expansion, while Julián Castro has said he would demand more “accountability” for charter schools than is required now due to the fact they are run independently.

Kamala Harris acted against charter schools when she was California’s attorney general and supported the Los Angeles teachers who demanded more rules for charter schools when they went out on strike in January.

Amy Klobuchar has said charter schools must meet “high standards” if they want to meet the definition of public schools.

Andrew Yang said, “I am pro-good school” during the last Democrat debate.

Beto O’Rourke has said for-profit charter schools should be banned, but, in June, said “there is a role” for them.

DFER states school choice is “in line with the Obama education legacy.”

“It’s no secret that our public schools need to be better funded, but that’s just the beginning of the story,” said Shavar Jeffries, president of DFER, and added:

The public sees that we need to more fairly fund underserved schools and pay teachers more who teach hard-to-staff subjects and serve in high-need schools. The poll findings are a call to action to continue the work started by President Obama and find ways to make our schools more equitable.

Left-wing groups, such as Planned Parenthood, the ACLU, and LGBT activist organizations, have muscled their way into charter schools in California. In 2018, the California Healthy Youth Act required comprehensive sex education (CSE) to be taught in charter schools as well as traditional public schools.

Meanwhile, some teachers’ unions have opened membership to charter school teachers. In December 2018, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and the American Federation of Teachers backed the nation’s first strike by charter school teachers.

However, officials from the Illinois Network of Charter Schools (INCS) criticized CTU’s involvement in the negotiations, saying the strike would restrict the independence of the charter school.

“If we accede to the idea that every unionized charter in Chicago has to have the exact same (working conditions), pretty soon we’re going to lose what the movement has contributed to the city — which is a vibrancy, a differential approach,” INCS president Andrew Broy said, according to the Chicago Tribune. “It would be a step backward for the city if we go down that path.”

The acceptance of charter schools in the education platform of the Democrat Party would likely mean a more robust attempt on its part to force charter schools to become more like traditional public schools under the banner of “accountability” for taxpayer dollars."

(CNN) Some people are questioning presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren's claim that she was basically fired from a teaching job in the early 1970s because she was pregnant. It's hard to imagine that many of them understand what it's like to be a working mother -- then or now.

Kara Alaimo

Media outlets have dug up a 2007 interview in which Sen. Warren recalled that teaching job, saying she remembered thinking ""I don't think this is going to work out for me. I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple years,"" to suggest she left her job of her own volition. That's insane.

Whether she was fired or left because she saw the writing on the wall that her job would be incompatible with motherhood -- and who can blame her for not remembering the precise details of something that happened nearly five decades ago -- the point is that our society makes it extraordinarily tough to be a working mom, especially a new mom. It's bad now, but it was even worse when Warren had her children. She deserves credit for overcoming obstacles that her male opponents simply didn't face. And our next president, whoever that is, needs to be someone who understands these barriers.

I know because I'm a new mom. I have three graduate degrees and have been awarded tenure in my university teaching job. This means that I have much more flexibility than most working moms. Outside of classes, I can name my own office hours and manage to take my baby to the pediatrician during the workday. But, since becoming a mom last year, I've still found it incredibly tough to continue to work.

A big part of the challenge is that the cost of full-time, quality childcare rivals my own take-home pay -- and, as a university professor, my salary vastly exceeds the income of the average American and the salary of schoolteachers in positions like the one Warren held. Many women paying taxes on their own income and then paying a child care provider on the books might actually lose money by going to work -- and that's before taking account of other costs associated with jobs, like commuting and professional clothes. According to Child Care Aware of America, the average cost of child care is over $20,000 per year in most parts of the country . Yet the median income is only $56,000 per year -- before taxes."

Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday detailed a new environmental justice plan aimed at bolstering and protecting vulnerable communities on the front lines of the climate crisis.,2019-10-09,CNN,Elizabeth Warren unveils environmental justice plan,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/09/politics/elizabeth-warren-environmental-justice-plan/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday detailed a new environmental justice plan aimed at bolstering and protecting vulnerable communities on the front lines of the climate crisis.

""Our crisis of environmental injustice is the result of decades of discrimination and environmental racism compounding in communities that have been overlooked for too long,"" Warren writes in a Medium post.

The Massachusetts Democrat would direct one-third of her proposed climate investment to the most vulnerable communities, which she writes would funnel at least $1 trillion into those areas over the next decade.

Warren's Wednesday release offers new insight into how she would use presidential powers to orchestrate what climate activists often call a ""just transition"" toward a green energy economy. While covering a broad range of policy issues, the post is primarily focused on what her administration would do to prioritize neighborhoods, cities and entire regions with heavy minority populations -- many of them still suffering from the effects of racist policies like redlining, which often placed families of color in harm's way.

Throughout her campaign, Warren has frequently sought to weave in detailed proposals directed specifically at communities of color. Here, she warns that ""'one-size-fits-all' solutions,"" though often well-intentioned, open up space for the exploitation of those minorities and the poor. Because of that, Warren argues, more narrowly ""targeted"" policies are required.

""To preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached,"" the former vice president said of the current White House occupant, adding: ""He's shooting holes in the Constitution. And we cannot let him get away with it.""

Biden had previously indicated that he favored considering impeachment for Trump only if the administration refused to turn over documents to Congress related to the ongoing Ukraine investigation. On Tuesday night, the White House made clear they would not cooperate in any way with the House impeachment probe.

On its face then, Biden's hand was forced by the White House's decision not to cooperate at all. And that undoubtedly was a factor! But so likely did this fact: In four of the last five national polls aggregated by Real Clear Politics, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren takes a larger share of the national primary vote than Biden. And for the first time in this race, Warren's polling average is now above Biden's -- albeit by .2 percentage points.

What those numbers mean is that Biden is really starting to feel the heat from Warren. While she has been rising in polls for months now, it's become clear of late that she isn't slowing down much, even as she approaches and passes Biden, who has been the race's frontrunner since the day he announced his candidacy."
208,"Daniella Diaz and MJ Lee, CNN",,"Sen.

Elizabeth Warren said she will not solicit wealthy donors and hold high-dollar fundraisers if she wins the Democratic presidential nomination, in a shift from earlier this year when she said that fundraising strategy was just for the primary contest.

When asked in an interview with CBS News released Tuesday whether she'd ""pivot"" or be ""forced"" to have big-dollar fundraisers if she won the nomination, Warren responded: ""No.""

""I will not be forced to make changes in how I raise money,"" the Massachusetts Democrat said. ""Look, for me this is pretty straight forward. Either you think democracy works and electing a president is all about going behind closed doors with bazillionaires and corporate executives and lobbyists and scooping up as much money as possible. Or you think it's about a grassroots, let's build this from the ground up.""

She later added: ""I'm not going to go do the big-dollar fundraisers. I'm just not going to do it.""

Despite her success with small-dollar donors during the primary, declining to raise big sums could put Warren at a significant financial disadvantage in a general-election battle with President Donald Trump. Trump and the Republican National Committee raised $125 million during the July-to-September fundraising quarter -- fueled, in part, by six-figure donations collected at ritzy events. On a single day in August, for instance, Trump and the RNC raised $12 million at two fundraisers in the Hamptons.

209,"Analysis by Brandon Tensley, CNN",,"It was another instance of that most common of events: a woman, diminished.",2019-10-09,CNN,Analysis: Warren pregnancy debate another example of sexism in the guise of scrutiny,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/09/politics/elizabeth-warren-pregnancy-discrimination-sexism/index.html,"Washington (CNN) It was another instance of that most common of events: a woman, diminished.

Earlier this week, Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator and Democratic presidential candidate, was asked about a story that she's mentioned often on the campaign trail: In 1971, when she was 22 years old and completing her first year of teaching, she lost her job once it became clear that she was visibly pregnant. It was, she tweeted , ""an experience millions of women will recognize.""

But over the past few days, conservative news sites and mainstream outlets either have sought to directly refute Warren's account or have disputed it in such a way that it seems as if there's some reason to doubt that a school in the early 1970s would fire a pregnant woman. But that kind of discrimination continues today. (As The New York Times documented earlier this year , American companies still ""systematically sideline"" pregnant women by, for instance, passing them over for promotions.)

Warren's story, however, fits into a much larger pattern, one that will indeed be familiar to many women: It's the tradition of sexism in the guise of scrutiny.

Consider how, this same week, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, another Democratic presidential hopeful, was pulled into a case at the global law firm DLA Piper , where a junior partner alleges that one of the company's higher-ups sexually assaulted her four times. Harris' only connection to the firm is that her husband is one of its hundreds of partners.

Yet that hasn't prevented the junior partner's lawyer from trying to use Harris' star power to bring attention to a case not meaningfully related to the senator. (In response, a statement from Harris' communications director underscores that the senator ""has been and continues to be a staunch advocate for survivors and believes all people must be guaranteed their day in court."")

By contrast, in the wake of the revelation last week that Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont suffered a heart attack , that gendered line of questioning has been noticeably absent from political chatter. Sanders, instead, has received the kid-gloves treatment.

Each of these examples is, in its own way, a distillation of age-old policing mechanisms and double standards. Each also shines a light on the inveterate sexism -- women as unreliable narrators, women as answerable for their husbands' professional lives, women as weak -- that still, today, takes up so much space in the narrative.

Or to use Warren's own words, ""I don't know what else you'd call it."""

The debate will air live exclusively on MSNBC, and will livestream on NBC News and MSNBC digital platforms and on The Washington Post's web and mobile apps, according to the DNC. The venue, format and moderators will be announced at a future date.

The candidates who have met the thresholds to qualify for the November debate so far include: Former Vice President Joe Biden, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, billionaire Tom Steyer, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and businessman Andrew Yang.

Last month, the DNC raised the polling and donor thresholds required to qualify for the November debate. Candidates will have to reach 3% in at least four DNC-approved polls of Democratic voters nationally or in one of the four early-voting states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. The change is a 1 percentage point increase over the threshold for the September and October debates. Candidates also have a new option of reaching at least 5% in two polls of the early-voting states.

Candidates hoping to qualify need contributions from at least 165,000 individuals, coming from at least 600 unique donors in 20 or more states. The deadline for qualifying polls and donations for the November debate will be November 13 at 11:59 p.m., according to the DNC.

Instead of focusing on doing his job and focusing on the important issues like improving our infrastructure, making New York competitive despite oppressive taxes and regulations, or lowering the cost of prescription drugs, Max fell in line with the most radical elements of the Democratic Party.

“It’s insulting the left is questioning our decision of whom we voted for,” one voter said:

“Max Rose’s constituents overwhelmingly voted to elect President Trump, but Max just can’t let it go: he’s absolutely obsessed with impeaching Trump and overturning his constituents’ choice in the 2016 election,” Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) spokesman Calvin Moore said in a statement.

“Max Rose has no intention of delivering on any of the issues voters elected him on, as long as he can team up with radical left for one more Hail Mary pass at removing Trump from office, no matter the cost,” he added.

Rose defended his decision to back the inquiry on Monday.

“I didn’t fight our enemies overseas so that our leaders would invite them to interfere in our elections back home,” he said.

“It’s disappointing to see the Republican Party put China and Russia ahead of America,” he continued. “My job is to get the facts, not play politics — and that’s exactly what I’m going to do.”

Rose is not the only lawmaker who has faced protests over support for the impeachment inquiry. Protesters surrounded Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) at the Reno airport last week, demanding her to “stop the impeachment” of Trump:

Additionally, Trump supporters greeted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) in South Carolina on Friday, holding up signs reading, “Impeach Pelosi”:

But is she seriously eyeing another run?,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/09/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-2020/index.html,"(CNN) Hillary Clinton fired off another taunting tweet to President Donald Trump on Thursday, saying, ""It's becoming a challenge to keep up with the high crimes and misdemeanors.""

Clinton is carefully following the daily developments in the ongoing impeachment drama -- and is having fun at her former rival's expense -- but that doesn't mean she is seriously weighing another run for president, several of her friends and advisers tell CNN.

Clinton's recent reentry into the public sphere after months out of the limelight has led to speculation that she could be seriously considering a rematch with Trump. Those questions have been stoked by Clinton herself, who responded to a recent Trump tweet about her running again by simply saying, ""Don't tempt me, "" and joked with PBS' Judy Woodruff about a possible round two with the President.

""Maybe there does need to be a rematch,"" Clinton said jokingly. ""Obviously, I can beat him again."" Clinton bested Trump in the popular vote, but fell short in the Electoral College.

But Clinton's reemergence is more a product of fortuitous timing and feeling unencumbered than a genuine exploration of a 2020 run.

""No,"" said longtime Clinton friend and former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, when asked if Clinton is considering a run in 2020. ""I think she is having the time of her life and speaking her mind.""

McAuliffe, who was chair of Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, added: ""It drives Trump crazy. ... Trump and his massive ego cannot get over the fact that Hillary Clinton got 3 million more votes than he got. It drives him absolutely mad, so she is having fun shooting back at him.""

For Clinton, the moment is a twofold opportunity: promoting her book and taunting Trump. And friends who have spent time with her in recent weeks say she's enjoying both in equal measures.

""Yes, she loves taunting him. As much now as ever,"" a person close to Clinton told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. ""She's having fun, but that doesn't mean she's going to run again.""

Clinton, after writing ""The Book of Gutsy Women: Favorite Stories of Courage and Resilience"" with her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, was always planning a lengthy book tour. Little did she know, however, that she would kick off the tour mere hours before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the beginning of an impeachment inquiry into Trump.

That unexpected timing, aides said, meant Clinton was going to be far more public at the same time that Trump's presidency faced its most existential threat. Trump continues to bring up Clinton, tweeting about her regularly and often using questions around her email use as secretary of state to deflect from questions about his own legal issues.

Nick Merrill, Clinton's longtime spokesman, said the former nominee is ""not going to take (Trump's attacks) lying down.""

""She is out on a book tour,"" Merrill said, ""and she is having a little fun.""

One longtime loyal supporter said Clinton's jabs at Trump have created a fear among those close to her that she could ultimately consider a rematch, which many people believe would end badly for her.

""A lot of people are talking to her, which isn't helpful,"" another person close to Clinton told CNN. ""They get into her head because she so dislikes Donald Trump that she can't see straight.""

All of this chatter -- much of which comes from longtime Clinton donors -- is focused on the notion of a rematch with Trump. Of course, should she decide to run -- again, highly unlikely -- she would face a Democratic primary fight in a far different landscape than the 2016 campaign.

""Sure, she thinks about it,"" said McAuliffe of another Clinton presidential run, ""but she is also realistic.""

Still, some friends email her political gambling sites, showing her with a strong chance of defeating Trump. Newspaper columns floating the idea of her running always make their way into her inbox, including one last week from former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.

""She feels vindicated on everything she felt during the campaign,"" a person close to Clinton said. ""She's been proven right. Does that mean she will run again? No.""

A longtime confidante put it more bluntly: ""She is NOT running.""

Clinton has, however, been directly involved with the 2020 race and is deeply immersed in its day-to-day machinations. She keeps up with the swirl of news around the large field of Democrats vying to take on Trump and, according to advisers, has talked to nearly all of the 2020 Democrats.

That includes recent conversations with former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the race's two front-runners, as well as in-person meetings with candidates like Sen. Kamala Harris of California, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and others. Clinton has not talked to Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an adviser said, who is running for the nomination again after challenging Clinton in 2016.

While Clinton has been involved in the 2020 primary behind the scenes, she does not plan to endorse in the contest, people close to her said.

Clinton's recent bluntness has been a stark break from how she was as a candidate in 2016, where she was more guarded and careful.

This shift was recently made clear when, during a book tour interview, Clinton replied to a question about the gutsiest thing she ever did with an answer that took even some of her advisers by surprise.

""I think the gutsiest thing I've ever done -- well, personally -- make the decision to stay in my marriage,"" Clinton told ABC, referring to her husband, then-President Bill Clinton, having an affair with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky in the 1990s.

""She feels unconstrained, free to speak her mind,"" said Merrill. ""Watch her on this book tour. It's liberating.""

This story has been updated with Hillary Clinton's tweet from Thursday."

Trump believed Ukraine was still rampantly corrupt and said that if President Volodymyr Zelensky wanted to meet with him, Giuliani would have to be convinced first, one source said.

""If they can satisfy Rudy, they can satisfy the President,"" a person familiar with the meeting said.

Trump's push to have Giuliani as gatekeeper is more direct than what was previously disclosed by one of the meeting's participants in his statement to the House last week. It also further demonstrates how significant Giuliani was in brokering access to the President regarding Ukraine policy and in passing messages to other administration officials.

CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.

A key accusation in the whistleblower's complaint that has prompted the impeachment probe into the President's dealings with Ukraine is that Giuliani, a private citizen, had been presenting to Ukraine a US policy different than that from US diplomats.

Their goal was to tell Trump that they had a favorable impression of Zelensky and his government, and that he was a reformer who Trump should trust and engage with, according to three sources familiar with the meeting.

They were hoping to set up a meeting between Trump and Zelensky, the sources said. They believed Ukraine under Zelensky was a more trusted ally than previous Ukrainian regimes, and that a visit between Trump and Zelensky could demonstrate to the Russian government that the US embraced a free Ukraine, according to two of the sources.

Notably, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was in Washington on May 23 but he did not attend the meeting with Trump.

Perry had led the delegation who attended Zelensky's inauguration, and was a central figure in the May meeting with Trump.

It became clear to the Trump administration officials, the sources said, that they would have to deal with Giuliani.

Volker hinted last week in speaking to the House how central Giuliani was in the President's foreign policy approach to Ukraine.

""The President was very skeptical,"" Volker said to the House committees, describing what had happened when he, Sondland and Perry spoke to Trump. ""In the course of that conversation, he referenced conversations with Mayor Giuliani.""

""He was clearly receiving other information from other sources, including Mayor Giuliani, that was more negative, causing him to retain this negative view "" of a corrupt Ukraine, Volker added.

The US officials then set out to correct the information feed coming into the President while realizing they would need to work with --and around -- Giuliani, according to the sources.

Two months later, during an interagency meeting, the Office of Management and Budget announced it would review whether Ukraine should receive $400 million in assistance from the US that had been set aside by Congress. The question on aid that arose later eventually became a major topic of conversation among Sondland, Volker and others.

Perry acknowledged speaking to Giuliani, according to an Energy Department spokesperson. The spokesperson didn't comment on the meeting itself or the substance of the conversations with Giuliani.

When asked if he had ever spoken to Perry about Ukraine, Giuliani responded by dismissing the question.

""Did Henry Kissinger ever call me about Ukraine,"" Giuliani wrote to CNN on Tuesday. ""What about Colin Powell.""

He then said that any information about his possible discussions with Perry would be privileged. He did not explain why."

But the biggest issue on the table now revolves around what happens in Mexico.,2019-10-09,CNN,GM's Mexican factories - Why ending the UAW strike will be so hard,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/09/business/uaw-gm-plant/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) The talks to resolve the longest auto industry strike in decades have taken place in downtown Detroit for 24 straight days. But the biggest issue on the table now revolves around what happens in Mexico.

The United Auto Workers union, whose nearly 50,000 members have been on strike against General Motors since Sept. 16, has previously made shifting work back from plants in Mexico to plants in the United States a major issue in the talks. But it is a bigger factor this year, after GM announced plans to close four US plants . While many other matters have been resolved, there remains a huge chasm between the two on that point.

Three plants -- an assembly line in Lordstown, Ohio , and transmission plants in Warren, Michigan ,and Baltimore -- have already halted production, while the Hamtramck assembly line in Detroit is slated to close early next year. The union wants to keep these plants alive by shifting production from Mexico.

Terry Dittes, the UAW's chief negotiator, sent an email to union members Tuesday saying GM's refusal to make such a shift is the biggest problem in the talks.

""We have made it clear that there is no job security for us when GM products are made in other countries for the purpose of selling them here in the USA,"" he wrote. ""We believe that the vehicles GM sells here should be built here. We don't understand GM's opposition to this proposition. Building more world-class vehicles at our UAW-GM locations is the best solution for our members, our families, our communities and GM.""

The union is still negotiating over other issues, including wages, profit sharing and GM's use of temporary workers. But Dittes said ""economic gains in this agreement will mean nothing without job security.""

In recent contracts, automakers have offered job security to the union with promises to invest in plants, as well as plans to build specific vehicles in specific plants. GM said its current offer includes plans to invest more than $7 billion in US plants, which would create or protect about 5,400 jobs.

GM said the overwhelming majority of the cars it sells in the US are built in the US. While it doesn't provide the number of cars built in Mexico, the company points out that it has four factories in Mexico, compared to 29 in the United States -- not counting the four it is planning to close. It also said it has proposed ""solutions"" for the Hamtramck and Lordstown plants

GM GM Fiat Chrysler FCAU Ford F Data released by the UAW from Ward's Automotive Reports showsproduced 834,000 cars and trucks in Mexico last year, about 30% more thanand roughly triple the number of cars built there by. Overall it sold about 3 million vehicles in the United States last year.

Beyond those four plants, the union is worried that other GM plants could be at risk of closure without shifting production back to United States from Mexico. With Lordstown and Hamtramck still in the equation, GM's US plants were operating at about 68% of capacity, said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor & economics at the Center for Automotive Research, a Michigan think tank. Without them it'll be above 80% of US capacity, she said.

""You want to be in the 85% to 90% range,"" she said.

The vehicles GM is building in Mexico are among its best selling - the Silverado and Sierra pickups, the Blazer, Equinox, Terrain and Trax SUVs. Of those vehicles, only the Silverado and Sierra are also made at US plants. Those are already working around the clock on three shifts turning out pickups. The Terrain and Blazer are built only in Mexico. The Trax is built in Mexico and South Korea, and the Equinox is built in Mexico and Canada.

Most of those vehicles are early in their product life cycle, such as the Blazer, which is in its first year of production. Typically if a vehicle is going to be shifted from one plant to another, it's when there is a major design change after at least five or more years.

""It cost billions of dollars to put them [in Mexico], and it'd cost billions of dollar to bring them back,"" said Dziczek. ""GM will be loath to move anything back that they just spent money to put there.""

In addition, GM is paying workers in Mexico a fraction of the more than $30 an hour that veteran UAW members make at US plants.

But not bringing product back from Mexico creates its own problems for GM. Any labor deal needs to be ratified by UAW membership before it can take effect. And with the plant closing plans, membership is focused on job security as a top issue.

""What GM needs is they need it to be able to be ratified,"" said Dziczek. ""Plants that get investment are plants that workers can feel will be around for a while."""

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Wednesday unveiled her plan to address “environmental injustice” and “environmental racism,” which includes a $1 trillion investment into minority communities affected by “industrial pollution.”

Warren argues that “justice” plays a massive role in properly addressing the climate change “crisis,” citing studies that suggest that black and Hispanic families are disproportionately affected by air pollution caused by white people:

A more recent study found that while whites largely cause air pollution, Blacks and Latinxs are more likely to breathe it in. Unsurprisingly, these groups also experience higher rates of childhood asthma. And many more low-income and minority communities are exposed to toxins in their water – including lead and chemicals from industrial and agricultural run-off.

Warren calls this phenomenon “environmental racism” and concludes that “environmental injustice is the result of decades of discrimination and environmental racism compounding in communities that have been overlooked for too long.”

She previewed her plan in a video clip featuring far-left “Squad” member Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).

“We need a government that’s on the side of families—not giant corporations polluting our communities. @RashidaTlaib and I walked through 48217, the most polluted zip code in Michigan, and talked with the families living every day with the effects of pollution,” Warren tweeted alongside the clip:

Like Warren’s other proposals, her environmental injustice plan weaves in aspects of her other campaign promises. For instance, Warren says her housing plan will provide an assistance program, aimed to get impoverished families out of poor, pollution-ridden neighborhoods and into the “neighborhood of their choice.”

She also pledges to invest one-third – or $1 trillion – of her climate change investment “into the most vulnerable communities,” although she does not specify what the $1 trillion will be spent on, specifically.

Like most of Warren’s plans, her environmental injustice proposal involves the implementation of another tax. In this instance, it is the “Superfund Waste Tax.”

Her plan states:

There are over 1300 remaining Superfund sites across the country, many located in or adjacent to frontline communities. So-called “orphan” toxic waste clean-ups were originally funded by a series of excise taxes on the petroleum and chemical industries. But thanks to Big Oil and other industry lobbyists, when that tax authority expired in 1995 it was not renewed. Polluters must pay for the consequences of their actions – not leave them for the communities to clean up. I’ll work with Congress to reinstate and then triple the Superfund tax, generating needed revenue to clean up the mess.

The presidential hopeful even weaves in Medicare for All as part of her broader proposal, arguing such a system will “make it easier for the federal government to quickly tailor health care responses to specific environmental disasters in affected communities when they occur.”

Warren also reiterates her pledge to “ensure that employers and our government honor the promises they made to workers in fossil fuel industries.”

“I’ve fought for years to protect pensions and health benefits for retired coal workers, and I’ll continue fighting to maintain the solvency of multi-employer pension plans,” she said. “As president, I’ll protect those benefits that fossil fuel workers have earned.”

However, Warren’s role in crafting a petition to the Supreme Court on behalf of LTV Steel – which helped the company’s “fight against a congressional requirement that it pay millions of dollars into a fund for its retired coal miners’ health care” – calls her promise into question.

“As I’ve traveled this country, I’ve heard the human stories from frontline communities. Families where many people have cancer. Coastal communities facing the threat of rising sea levels. Ruined land and poisoned water,” Warren tweeted.

“These communities need justice—and I will stand with them,” she added:

But we must ensure that we honor our commitments to fossil fuel workers as we transition to the new green economy. We'll ensure that new jobs have similar wages and benefits. And I'll fight to protect the pensions and benefits that they've earned. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 9, 2019"
221,Joel B. Pollak,"Warren explained that the reason she told the story differently as a politician than as a law professor was because she had decided to “open up” about elements of her personal life that she had previously chosen not to highlight.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) told CBS News in an interview published late Monday evening that she was, in fact, replaced in her teaching job in 1971 because she was “visibly pregnant,” despite newly emerged evidence otherwise.

Warren explained that the reason she told the story differently as a politician than as a law professor was because she had decided to “open up” about elements of her personal life that she had previously chosen not to highlight.

In a 2007 interview — first flagged by left-wing Jacobin magazine wrier Meagan Day, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America — Warren said that she chose to leave her teaching job as a speech pathologist for disabled children in a public school primarily because she lacked the necessary educational qualifications. “And I went back to graduate school, and took a couple of courses in education, and said, ‘I don’t think this is going to work out for me.'” She added: “And I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby, and I stayed home for a couple of years.”

That account appears to be supported by county school board minutes published Monday by the Washington Free Beacon, which report that Warren’s part-time teaching job as a substitute teacher had been unanimously extended for a second year, and that her decision later to resign from the post had been accepted by the board “with regret.”

CBS news found further evidence that Warren had left her position voluntarily: “Local newspaper reports from 1971 also present reasons for her leaving the school alternative to what she describes on the trail. The Paterson News, a local paper, reported that summer that Warren was ‘leaving to raise a family.’ The next month, a story about the school board hiring a replacement said Warren had ‘resigned for personal reasons,’ even though the board had voted to ‘appoint’ Warren to the same speech pathology job that April, according to an earlier report.”

However, CBS News also found evidence that might lend weight to Warren’s claims.

Two retired teachers from the same school district who did not remember Warren said, according to CBS News, that they “don’t remember anyone being explicitly fired due to pregnancy during their time at the school.” However, they added that “a non-tenured, pregnant employee like Warren would have had little job security,” reporters Zak Hudak and Bo Erickson noted.

One teacher recalled: “The rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant. Now, if you didn’t tell anybody you were pregnant, and they didn’t know, you could fudge it and try to stay on a little bit longer. … But they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant.” Pregnant teachers did not enjoy protection from discrimination in New Jersey until the passage of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978, and the school board was all-male, CBS adds.

Warren told CBS News: “All I know is I was 22 years old, I was 6 months pregnant, and the job that I had been promised for the next year was going to someone else. The principal said they were going to hire someone else for my job.”

The “all I know” phrase is familiar from Warren’s apology for claiming, falsely, that she was Native American: “All I know is, during this time period this is consistent with what I did because it was based on my understanding from my family’s stories. But family stories are not the same as tribal citizenship and this why I have apologized,” she said in February 2019.

In both cases Warren suggested that any factual inconsistencies were inadvertent.

The RCP average also reflects Sen. Kamala Harris’s (D-CA) continued fall, showing Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) taking her formerly held fourth place position with 5.6 percent support to the California senator’s 4.4 percent.

The average shows Andrew Yang (D) in sixth place with 2.8 percent support, followed by Beto O’Rourke (D) with two percent support. The remaining candidates are averaging less than two percent:

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has been untruthful in telling voters she was fired from a teaching job because she was “visibly pregnant.”

As Breitbart News noted Sunday, Warren’s campaign tale was called into question by a 2007 interview in which she suggested she left for lack of qualifications and interest.

County records published by the Washington Free Beacon on Monday confirm that Warren resigned and was never fired.

The Free Beacon’s Collin Anderson reported:

RIVERDALE, N.J.—The Riverdale Board of Education approved a second-year teaching contract for a young Elizabeth Warren, documents show, contradicting the Democratic presidential candidate’s repeated claims that she was asked not to return to teaching after a single year because she was “visibly pregnant.” Minutes of an April 21, 1971, Riverdale Board of Education meeting obtained by the Washington Free Beacon show that the board voted unanimously on a motion to extend Warren a “2nd year” contract for a two-days-per-week teaching job. That job is similar to the one she held the previous year, her first year of teaching. Minutes from a board meeting held two months later, on June 16, 1971, indicate that Warren’s resignation was “accepted with regret.”

In fact, the minutes show that far from being fired, Warren had been unanimously approved for a second year:

The minutes also confirm a key detail from the 2007 interview: namely, that Warren was hired on an “emergency” basis because she lacked the necessary education qualifications, despite graduating from George Washington University with a degree in speech pathology, and supposedly pursuing a lifelong dream of being a public school teacher.

In the course of her presidential campaign, Warren has repeatedly told the nation a very different story — one in which an old-fashioned male principal discriminated against her because of her pregnancy.

In the second presidential debate in Detroit, for example, Warren said: “[A]t the end of that first year, I was visibly pregnant. And back in the day, that meant that the principal said to me — wished me luck and hired someone else for the job.”

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), a leading 2020 Democrat presidential primary candidate, is vowing to “fight” for back pay for illegal aliens.

As part of Warren’s “Empowering American Workers and Raising Wages” plan, illegal aliens who have worked illegally in the United States — sometimes by stealing Americans’ identities and Social Security numbers — would become eligible to receive back pay for their previous work by amending the National Labor Relations Act.

Warren writes:

Ensuring employers can’t exploit undocumented workers and drive down standards for all workers: The 2002 Supreme Court case Hoffman Plastic Compounds v. NLRB held that an undocumented worker could not receive the backpay he was owed from an employer who had violated the NLRA. That 5–4 ruling is wrong and denies millions of undocumented workers redress for illegal firings or other retaliatory conduct by an employer. The case encourages employers to hire undocumented immigrants and exploit them in numerous fields, including construction and manufacturing, which could lower wages for all workers. I will fight to amend the NLRA to end this form of exploitation and ensure that all workers are protected. [Emphasis added]

Despite her platform of populist economic patriotism, Warren has committed to driving up foreign competition against America’s working and middle class in the U.S. labor market by providing amnesty for 11 to 22 million illegal aliens, increasing current legal immigration levels, and decriminalizing illegal immigration.

Warren Undercuts Populist Agenda with Donor Class Immigration Planhttps://t.co/RAdJlUT44k — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) August 28, 2019

Absent from Warren’s workers plan is a mandate and punishment for employers and businesses who hire illegal aliens over American citizens, as well as a reform to the H-1B visa program whereby Americans are readily replaced by foreign visa workers to increase profit margins for multinational corporations.

Warren has not endorsed mandatory E-Verify — a system that prevents businesses from hiring illegal aliens over Americans — though it would decrease foreign competition against Americans, especially those most vulnerable to competing against illegal aliens in the labor market.

In contrast to Warren is President Trump’s populist-nationalist “Buy American, Hire American” agenda, which has sought to increase interior immigration enforcement to tighten the labor market and delivered wage hikes for America’s blue-collar and working class. Unlike Warren, Trump’s latest national immigration plan includes a nationwide mandate of E-Verify to prevent Americans from being forced to compete for jobs against illegal aliens.

Today, there are at least eight million illegal aliens holding American jobs in the U.S. economy that would have otherwise gone to American workers and legal immigrants. In most cases, these illegal workers obtain fraudulent work authorization documents or steal American citizens’ identities in order to take jobs.

Warren, who has touted her campaign as 100 percent grassroots-funded, refused to say if she would require that her running mate not attend big-money fundraisers.

“Is your vice presidential pick going to also try and avoid those high-dollar fundraisers as well?” a reporter asked.

Warren refused to answer the question directly, calling it “a little premature” and essentially leaving the door open for her potential running mate to attend high-dollar fundraisers, which she prides herself on avoiding.

“You know, I think it’s a little premature to be talking about vice presidential. We’re still in primary here, and I’m working hard on this,” she said.

But look, I want a vice presidential partner, someone who’s going to get out there and fight for the same values,” she added:

Warren’s claims of a 100 percent grassroots-funded campaign have been called into question, particularly following a report that indicated she used millions in leftover funds – $10.4 million – from her 2018 senatorial bid to cushion her presidential campaign. At the time, Warren happily courted big donors and attended fundraisers, causing some to question her commitment to a true grassroots operation.

Former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell (D) contributed $4,000 to Warren in 2018 and noted her sudden change of heart.

As Breitbart News reported:

Rendell cohosted a Biden fundraiser earlier this year. To his surprise, the Warren campaign slammed the event as “a swanky private fund-raiser for wealthy donors” – despite the fact that Warren benefitted from similar events in the recent past. “She didn’t have any trouble taking our money the year before,” Rendell said, according to the Times. “All of a sudden, we were bad guys and power brokers and influence-peddlers. In 2018, we were wonderful.”

Warren also attended fundraisers hosted by billionaires– specifically Henry and Marsha Laufer.

As the New York Times reported:

In Florida, she was hosted for an event by the billionaires Henry and Marsha Laufer. In New York, Meyer S. Frucher, the vice chairman of Nasdaq, held a reception for her. She was hosted by the “Lost” creator Damon Lindelof and his wife, Heidi, in Southern California. The philanthropist Stephen M. Silberstein had Ms. Warren over to his San Francisco-area home. And as late as the fall of 2018, she visited Silicon Valley, where Karla Jurvetson, a multimillion-dollar Democratic contributor, hosted an event for her.

Warren’s campaign reported $24.6 million raised in the third quarter, less than $1 million short of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) $25.3 million. Approximately 940,000 contributions comprised the third-quarter haul, having an average donation of $26."

The former secretary of state continued, calling the partisan-fueled impeachment inquiry the “appropriate remedy” to the “serious assault on our democracy that is apparently asked for.”

“So impeachment is the appropriate remedy, and it is such a serious assault on our democracy that is apparently asked for, aided and abetted by not only the president but his allies who seem not to either care or understand how deeply dangerous this is,” Clinton said.

“I am all in favor of what the House is doing and gathering the evidence and making the case because this president has to be held to account because of his unconstitutional abuse of power, his contempt of Congress, and his obstruction of justice,” she added.

But, just seriously, I don’t understand, I don’t think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.

The reason is simple: offending China’s regime can have serious business consequences. There is little risk to sales or profits from offending U.S. leaders or the American people by kowtowing to Chinese pressure.

“The price you pay for backing down to China is a week of Twitter opprobrium,” Jude Blanchette, the CSIS Freeman Chair in China Studies said in an interview on CNBC Tuesday. “Whereas the price you pay in China is the loss of market access.”

The NBA furor began when Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted his support for Hong Kong’s protesters.

That’s hardly a controversial position in the U.S., where there is widespread sympathy for the protesters who often wave U.S. flags and say they are inspired by America’s tradition of liberty, but it is beyond the pale for China’s leaders. Although Twitter is blocked in China, Morey’s message — and the Chinese regime’s disapproval — was echoed through official and unofficial channels over the weekend. The tweet was swiftly deleted, and the NBA expressed sorrow for the offending words.

That is now a familiar pattern. Companies as diverse as Marriot, Delta, United, Apple, Coach, Tiffany, Vans, and Activision/Blizzard have all apologized or changed politics or products when confronted by China. Hollywood explicitly caters its films to the Chinese markets, careful not to offend the sensibilities of China’s nationalists and ruling elite. Often outspoken leaders of big American banks, like J.P. Morgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon or former Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein, fall silent when it comes to China’s human rights abuses, growing totalitarianism, and even trade abuses.

It’s easy to see why the NBA does not want to get shut out of China. Last year, 490 million people watched online NBA broadcasts in China, the Wall Street Journal reported. And with 1.4 billion people, China is perhaps the biggest potential growth market for the league.

That too is familiar. U.S. companies have long viewed China’s enormous population, growing economy, and rising middle class as an irresistible opportunity. Even when they are forced to surrender half of their profits to free-riding Chinese “partners,” few have been willing to forego the lure of access to China’s consumers.

That has largely been a reflection of U.S. policy toward China. The U.S. has encouraged further entanglement with China. One administration after the other, Democrat and Republican, encouraged further economic engagement and discouraged conflict. Even as the costs to the U.S. in terms of lost jobs were far worse than expected and the benefits of what was once viewed as the inevitable Chinese liberalization proved illusory, the policy was largely unwavering. This both served the interests of corporate America, at least in the short-term, and conditioned corporate America to accept China’s demands upon them.

The corner offices in America’s corporate headquarters are now populated by executives who rose through this systemic bias in favor of China engagement. Companies and executives who might have resisted China’s increasingly stringent policing of criticism from around the globe were shunted aside. Betting on China was just how you won in corporate America for the last few decades.

Now that might be changing. President Donald Trump has taken aim at China’s trade practices and economic predation with his tariffs. Capitol Hill lawmakers such as Marco Rubio have challenged China’s plans for dominance in technology. Democratic hopeful Elizabeth Warren has been severely critical of China on human rights and workers’ rights.

The backlash against the NBA’s kowtow illustrates this. It has come from all over the political spectrum.

This is bigger than just the @NBA. It’s about #China’s growing ability to restrict freedom of expression here in the U.S. TV networks,airlines,hotel chains,retailers & Hollywood already self censor. Now private citizens risk losing their jobs if they offend China. https://t.co/DQOFdBkb1e — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 7, 2019

China is trying to use its market power to silence free speech and criticism of its conduct. In response, the NBA chose its pocketbook over its principles—and our values. We should all be speaking out in support of those protesting for their rights. https://t.co/IRiIY1cgDg — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 7, 2019

Wall Street Journal columnist Michael Bird is hopeful this could prompt a change in corporate America:

But firms will need to be more careful in the future. The NBA is discovering that groveling to Beijing is no longer a one-way street, as American politicians weighed in supporting Mr. Morey. The company’s strong brand in the U.S. could be tarnished if its executives are seen to be in the pocket of an autocratic government. Broad bipartisan support for Hong Kong protesters places businesses in political crosshairs they’d rather avoid.

And yet it might not amount to much — at least not without a policy follow-up.

As Blanchette points out, China still has the ability to punish U.S. companies that do no suppress speech critical of China. While the cost of kowtowing is simply a public relations embarrassment that is likely to pass. No one thinks Americans will quit watching professional basketball because the league was too cozy with China’s leadership.

In fact, even as the backlash mounted in the U.S., China kept up the pressure. State broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) on Tuesday issued a statement on the social media platform Weibo noting its “strong dissatisfaction and opposition” to comments made by the NBA commissioner Adam Silver, who had held a press conference in which he walked back the league’s kowtow and defended Morey’s freedom to express his opinion.

“We believe that any speech challenging a country’s national sovereignty and social stability is not within the scope of freedom of speech,” CCTV said.

China has a policy of defending its reputation against criticism that can hurt the profits of U.S. businesses that defy it. The U.S. has politicians saying critical things — a kind of virtue signaling — on Twitter.

CNN reported that Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) won’t attend the town hall after suffering a heart attack last week. His campaign staff told CNN that he will be on stage for the Oct. 15 primary debate in Ohio.

CNN announced the names of the nine candidates who will be at the town hall, and the times they will be interviewed by CNN staff:

New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker will be interviewed by CNN’s Dana Bash at 7:30 p.m.

Former Vice President Joe Biden will be interviewed by CNN’s Anderson Cooper at 8 p.m.

South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg will be interviewed by Cooper at 8:30 p.m.

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren will be interviewed by CNN’s Chris Cuomo at 9 p.m.

California Sen. Kamala Harris will be interviewed by Cuomo at 9:30 p.m.

Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke will be interviewed by CNN’s Don Lemon at 10 p.m.

Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar will be interviewed by Lemon at 10:30 p.m.

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro will be interviewed by CNN’s Nia-Malika Henderson at 11 p.m.

Businessman Tom Steyer will be interviewed by Henderson at 11:30 p.m.

CNN reported on the details of its town hall:

Invitations to participate in the LGBTQ-focused town hall were extended to Democratic presidential hopefuls who met the DNC’s qualifications for the October 2019 primary debate. Candidates must have reached 2% in at least four national polls identified by the DNC to determine eligibility. The polls for this town hall must have been released between June 28, 2019 and September 25, 2019. In addition, candidates also needed to meet the donor threshold outlined by the DNC for the October debate, in which the candidates had to receive the financial support of 130,000 unique donors, including 400 donors each from at least 20 states. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and businessman Andrew Yang both declined HRCF’s invitation, each citing scheduling conflicts. A HRCF (Human Rights Campaign Foundation) spokesperson said the audience will be comprised of invited guests, LGBTQ stakeholders, and members of civic organizations. No public tickets will be available for the event.

Kamala Harris (D-CA) on Monday unveiled one of the most aggressive family-leave proposals to date, featuring six months of taxpayer-funded family and medical leave.

Harris, who is floundering in both national and early primary state polls, has switched her campaign strategy on issues that “keep families up at night,” dubbing it a “3 a.m. agenda.”

Under Harris’s proposal, every worker that makes less than $75,000 per year would be entitled to full wages during the six-month absence, which is three months longer than proposals pushed by Democrat lawmakers like Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). Higher earners would also receive compensation, but less than Americans under the outlined threshold.

The plan would allow workers to take advantage of the benefit outside of traditional childcare or medical-related issues and could apply to “chosen family.”

Politico reports:

For example, Harris’ campaign said that a parent could take leave to care for a child harmed by domestic violence. It wouldn’t be limited to immediate family — workers could take leave to care for domestic partners, parents-in-law and ‘chosen family,’ among others.

The benefits would extend to part-time workers, independent contractors, and self-employed workers as well.

Harris’s plan also calls for the passage of the Child Care for Working Families Act and pledges to “create a federal inter-agency working group tasked with cutting child poverty by 50 percent in her first term.” She also calls for the expansion of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program, or “food stamps.”

Harris plans to pay for her massive family leave proposal with “new payroll taxes on employers and employees in addition to unspecified ‘general revenues,'” as well as “fines on corporations that fail to narrow their gender-based pay gaps,” Politico reports.

The proposal comes in the wake of Harris’s continued struggle to gain support in polls. IBD-TIPP’s October poll showed the presidential hopeful dropping to fifth place nationally, with just three percent support:

The California senator has modified her strategy in recent weeks, spending time in Iowa in hopes of gaining traction in the early caucus state.

(CNN) Some people are questioning presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren's claim that she was basically fired from a teaching job in the early 1970s because she was pregnant. It's hard to imagine that many of them understand what it's like to be a working mother -- then or now.

Kara Alaimo

Media outlets have dug up a 2007 interview in which Sen. Warren recalled that teaching job, saying she remembered thinking ""I don't think this is going to work out for me. I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple years,"" to suggest she left her job of her own volition. That's insane.

Whether she was fired or left because she saw the writing on the wall that her job would be incompatible with motherhood -- and who can blame her for not remembering the precise details of something that happened nearly five decades ago -- the point is that our society makes it extraordinarily tough to be a working mom, especially a new mom. It's bad now, but it was even worse when Warren had her children. She deserves credit for overcoming obstacles that her male opponents simply didn't face. And our next president, whoever that is, needs to be someone who understands these barriers.

I know because I'm a new mom. I have three graduate degrees and have been awarded tenure in my university teaching job. This means that I have much more flexibility than most working moms. Outside of classes, I can name my own office hours and manage to take my baby to the pediatrician during the workday. But, since becoming a mom last year, I've still found it incredibly tough to continue to work.

A big part of the challenge is that the cost of full-time, quality childcare rivals my own take-home pay -- and, as a university professor, my salary vastly exceeds the income of the average American and the salary of schoolteachers in positions like the one Warren held. Many women paying taxes on their own income and then paying a child care provider on the books might actually lose money by going to work -- and that's before taking account of other costs associated with jobs, like commuting and professional clothes. According to Child Care Aware of America, the average cost of child care is over $20,000 per year in most parts of the country . Yet the median income is only $56,000 per year -- before taxes."

""There are now new reports, very troubling, that two Giuliani associates are being indicted on criminal charges by the Southern District,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York said at a Manhattan news conference

""Giuliani has been involved up to his neck in this entire mess,"" the senator said. ""He has an obligation to testify under oath so he can be asked questions so this can come to light.""

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said this week he wants to convene hearings to examine allegations of corruption in Ukraine.

""Given the House of Representatives' behavior, it is time for the Senate to inquire about corruption and other improprieties involving Ukraine,"" said Graham in a tweet. ""Therefore I will offer to Mr. Giuliani the opportunity to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to inform the committee of his concerns.""

Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday detailed a new environmental justice plan aimed at bolstering and protecting vulnerable communities on the front lines of the climate crisis.,2019-10-09,CNN,Elizabeth Warren unveils environmental justice plan,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/09/politics/elizabeth-warren-environmental-justice-plan/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday detailed a new environmental justice plan aimed at bolstering and protecting vulnerable communities on the front lines of the climate crisis.

""Our crisis of environmental injustice is the result of decades of discrimination and environmental racism compounding in communities that have been overlooked for too long,"" Warren writes in a Medium post.

The Massachusetts Democrat would direct one-third of her proposed climate investment to the most vulnerable communities, which she writes would funnel at least $1 trillion into those areas over the next decade.

Warren's Wednesday release offers new insight into how she would use presidential powers to orchestrate what climate activists often call a ""just transition"" toward a green energy economy. While covering a broad range of policy issues, the post is primarily focused on what her administration would do to prioritize neighborhoods, cities and entire regions with heavy minority populations -- many of them still suffering from the effects of racist policies like redlining, which often placed families of color in harm's way.

Throughout her campaign, Warren has frequently sought to weave in detailed proposals directed specifically at communities of color. Here, she warns that ""'one-size-fits-all' solutions,"" though often well-intentioned, open up space for the exploitation of those minorities and the poor. Because of that, Warren argues, more narrowly ""targeted"" policies are required.

Having a presence at DragCon could've been seen as pandering. But that doesn't seem to be how audiences took it, likely because it was bolstered by Warren's aforementioned policy stances. Indeed, it's significant that the senator did something politicos often struggle to do: show a deeper willingness to meet LGBTQ voters where they are and on their own terms."

""To preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached,"" the former vice president said of the current White House occupant, adding: ""He's shooting holes in the Constitution. And we cannot let him get away with it.""

Biden had previously indicated that he favored considering impeachment for Trump only if the administration refused to turn over documents to Congress related to the ongoing Ukraine investigation. On Tuesday night, the White House made clear they would not cooperate in any way with the House impeachment probe.

On its face then, Biden's hand was forced by the White House's decision not to cooperate at all. And that undoubtedly was a factor! But so likely did this fact: In four of the last five national polls aggregated by Real Clear Politics, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren takes a larger share of the national primary vote than Biden. And for the first time in this race, Warren's polling average is now above Biden's -- albeit by .2 percentage points.

What those numbers mean is that Biden is really starting to feel the heat from Warren. While she has been rising in polls for months now, it's become clear of late that she isn't slowing down much, even as she approaches and passes Biden, who has been the race's frontrunner since the day he announced his candidacy."
247,"Daniella Diaz and MJ Lee, CNN",,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she will not solicit wealthy donors and hold high-dollar fundraisers if she wins the Democratic presidential nomination, in a shift from earlier this year when she said that fundraising strategy was just for the primary contest.",2019-10-09,CNN,Elizabeth Warren says she won't do big dollar fundraisers if she wins the nomination,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/09/politics/elizabeth-warren-fundraisers/index.html,"(CNN) Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she will not solicit wealthy donors and hold high-dollar fundraisers if she wins the Democratic presidential nomination, in a shift from earlier this year when she said that fundraising strategy was just for the primary contest.

When asked in an interview with CBS News released Tuesday whether she'd ""pivot"" or be ""forced"" to have big-dollar fundraisers if she won the nomination, Warren responded: ""No.""

""I will not be forced to make changes in how I raise money,"" the Massachusetts Democrat said. ""Look, for me this is pretty straight forward. Either you think democracy works and electing a president is all about going behind closed doors with bazillionaires and corporate executives and lobbyists and scooping up as much money as possible. Or you think it's about a grassroots, let's build this from the ground up.""

She later added: ""I'm not going to go do the big-dollar fundraisers. I'm just not going to do it.""

Despite her success with small-dollar donors during the primary, declining to raise big sums could put Warren at a significant financial disadvantage in a general-election battle with President Donald Trump. Trump and the Republican National Committee raised $125 million during the July-to-September fundraising quarter -- fueled, in part, by six-figure donations collected at ritzy events. On a single day in August, for instance, Trump and the RNC raised $12 million at two fundraisers in the Hamptons.

But she still needs to win over black voters,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/10/politics/elizabeth-warren-black-voters/index.html,"Charleston, South Carolina (CNN) At an annual awards dinner hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington, DC, last month, Rev. Jesse Jackson watched as a stream of attendees walked over to one 2020 Democratic candidate, looking to shake her hand, chat and take a photo together.

It was Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , being approached ""all night long,"" Jackson said: ""People coming across the room to get a picture.""

The overwhelmingly positive reception that Warren received at the black-tie CBC gala wasn't the first time the senator has stood out this year at a forum of a largely black audience. Warren received a standing ovation at the ""She The People"" conference this summer as she presented her idea for bringing down the maternal mortality rate among black women ; in June, Jackson lavished her with praise at the Rainbow Push conference; and Warren appeared to be a crowd favorite at Al Sharpton's National Action Network conference in April, when she spoke about the acute challenges facing African-American homeowners.

But as Warren continues a steady climb in the national polls and now shares the front-runner status with former Vice President Joe Biden, Warren confronts a tough political reality. Those standout moments, coupled with public praise from African American leaders and activists, have yet to fully translate to support among black voters

According to a Quinnipiac national poll released on Tuesday, Warren is the top-choice candidate for 20% of black Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters. It is a notable improvement from the 10% support Warren had among black voters in an August Quinnipiac survey, but Biden still remains well ahead in support among blacks, at 36%.

Whether Warren can continue to improve her standing with this critical demographic group will be particularly important in the early voting state of South Carolina. A recent CNN poll showed Biden with a strong lead in the state, with the support of 45% of black likely primary voters. The same survey showed Warren with only 4% support among black voters in the state.

In an earlier Quinnipiac poll released at the end of September, seven in 10 black voters said they would be ""excited"" if Warren were the Democratic nominee, and 60% said they had a favorable view of the senator. But around two in 10 black voters said they still had not heard enough about Warren to have a favorable or unfavorable view of her. In contrast, 70% of those black voters said they had a favorable view of Biden, and only 5% said they hadn't heard enough about the former vice president to have a positive or negative opinion of him.

It has not gone unnoticed that some of Warren's events in South Carolina have featured largely white audiences. And despite the warm reception at the CBC dinner, Warren has not received endorsements from any black lawmakers in that caucus, unlike Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris.

On Wednesday, after another ""walking tour"" through a Charleston, South Carolina, neighborhood, Warren held a roundtable meeting with local residents, activists and leaders.

Asked by CNN how she would win over black voters who are far more familiar with Biden, Warren responded: ""I'm showing up, because I think that's really important -- showing up and shaking hands and talking with people.""

State Sen. Marlon Kimpson, who joined Warren in the discussion and applauded her for visiting his constituents, told reporters that he believes Biden has a ""head start"" with black voters because of name recognition.

""But I caution all candidates: Things in the rear mirror are closer than they appear. It's a wide-open race, there are some built-in advantages based on name recognition, but all candidates including the vice president has to make the case,"" said Kimpson, who has not yet made an endorsement.

According to Jackson, who himself ran for President twice in the 1980s, he and Warren speak ""quite often."" The civil rights activists told CNN in an interview the senator has reached out to him periodically as she has mounted a bid for the White House.

""She appears to be fearless,"" Jackson said. He has not endorsed in the Democratic primary and said he is undecided on whether he will publicly back someone before the Iowa caucuses. ""People hear her and they respond to her. She has the capacity to arouse the base.""

""It's not enough to talk about black people as if we're a monolith""

The Warren campaign has sought to reach out to the black community through its policy plans.

From her student loan debt forgiveness plan to her housing proposal to plans on closing private prisons and assisting entrepreneurs of color, Warren has integrated measures aimed specifically at African Americans in many of her policy outlines. Asked about outreach the senator has been doing this year to the black community, the campaign also pointed to ""listening sessions"" she has held with black activists and leaders throughout the year, including in Philadelphia ahead of the Netroots Nation conference.

And even as early as the spring, Warren was spending time in the south, in states that hold contests in March after the all-important early states. In March, she visited the Mississippi Delta for a ""walking tours"" of Cleveland and Greenville, Mississippi, to promote her rural housing plan, and also held campaign events in Tennessee and Alabama.

Ashlee Marie Preston, an African American transgender activist who has endorsed Warren, said she spoke with several other Democratic candidates before settling on Warren. It was in some ways an unexpected choice, she said, particularly given that there are two black candidates in the Democratic race: Sens. Harris and Cory Booker.

""I think it's easy to talk about racism in America -- it's another thing to be specific about the different layers about structural racism and systemic racism and how it continues to stand as a barrier to the poor and disenfranchised communities,"" Preston said. ""It's not enough to talk about black people as if we're a monolith.""

Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party, which endorsed Warren last month, echoed Preston's sentiment.

""Identity is important but identity is insufficient. Simply because candidates happen to occupy the same racial identity of black voters doesn't mean it's in the bag for any candidate,"" Mitchell said. ""And black voters are incredibly sophisticated. They want to understand a candidate's history, a candidate's platform.""

Other African American Warren supporters -- particularly those who have known the senator voters will for years -- insist that her standing with black voters will improve as they get to know the candidate better.

""I'm troubled by the numbers in South Carolina, only because I know that folks in South Carolina don't know her like we know her -- members of the African American community in Boston,"" said Rev. Jeffrey Brown, an associate pastor of the 12th Baptist Church in Roxbury, Massachusetts.

For years, Warren has periodically attended services at the 12th Baptist Church, one of the oldest black churches in the Boston area. Brown said Warren personally calls to give him a heads-up before attending Sunday services, and that while he has asked her on multiple occasions to speak to the congregation, she has largely declined.

Remarking upon the Bible that Warren brings to church -- ""What I love about her Bible is that it's not brand new. And I've seen it. I've looked at it. It's a well-worn thing"" -- Brown said it is what he sees as the senator's understanding of the unique needs of African-Americans that leads him to believe that there is room for black support for Warren to grow.

But the reality is that Warren has less than four months left to introduce herself to black voters across the country and intensively court them, in contrast to the years she has had to get to know black voters in Massachusetts.

""I wish I could go down to South Carolina to some of these places and say look -- this is not a show... She's a real advocate for us,"" said Brown, who added he is ""a thousand percent"" behind Warren's candidacy. ""I wish I could go down there to some southern churches and preach about that."""

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris all unveiled plans to expand LGBTQ protections and promote equal rights on Thursday, the day of an LGBTQ town hall hosted by CNN and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation.

The three candidates, whose plans are all similar, list passing the Equality Act as a top priority. The bill, which has passed the House of Representatives but has not been taken up by the Senate, would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other civil rights laws to include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected characteristics.

Warren, Buttigieg and Harris, along with several other 2020 Democrats, have been vocal about LGBTQ issues and rights throughout their presidential campaigns. Buttigieg stands out in the crowded 2020 Democratic field as someone who, if elected, would be the first man married to a same-sex partner to be president of the United States.

These plans come ahead of the CNN/Human Rights Campaign Foundation town hall, where Democratic presidential candidates will take questions from the audience and CNN journalists on specific LGBTQ concerns as well as their plans to promote equality and civility. The town hall will air Thursday from 7:30 p.m. to 12 a.m. ET.

The three candidates pledge to reverse the Trump administration's rollbacks of LGBTQ protections, including the ban on transgender military service members and religious exemption policies. Warren writes the US must end ""the weaponization of religion to discriminate against or harm LGBTQ+ people.""

250,"Analysis by Brandon Tensley, CNN",,"It was another instance of that most common of events: a woman, diminished.",2019-10-09,CNN,Analysis: Warren pregnancy debate another example of sexism in the guise of scrutiny,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/09/politics/elizabeth-warren-pregnancy-discrimination-sexism/index.html,"Washington (CNN) It was another instance of that most common of events: a woman, diminished.

Earlier this week, Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator and Democratic presidential candidate, was asked about a story that she's mentioned often on the campaign trail: In 1971, when she was 22 years old and completing her first year of teaching, she lost her job once it became clear that she was visibly pregnant. It was, she tweeted , ""an experience millions of women will recognize.""

But over the past few days, conservative news sites and mainstream outlets either have sought to directly refute Warren's account or have disputed it in such a way that it seems as if there's some reason to doubt that a school in the early 1970s would fire a pregnant woman. But that kind of discrimination continues today. (As The New York Times documented earlier this year , American companies still ""systematically sideline"" pregnant women by, for instance, passing them over for promotions.)

Warren's story, however, fits into a much larger pattern, one that will indeed be familiar to many women: It's the tradition of sexism in the guise of scrutiny.

Consider how, this same week, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, another Democratic presidential hopeful, was pulled into a case at the global law firm DLA Piper , where a junior partner alleges that one of the company's higher-ups sexually assaulted her four times. Harris' only connection to the firm is that her husband is one of its hundreds of partners.

Yet that hasn't prevented the junior partner's lawyer from trying to use Harris' star power to bring attention to a case not meaningfully related to the senator. (In response, a statement from Harris' communications director underscores that the senator ""has been and continues to be a staunch advocate for survivors and believes all people must be guaranteed their day in court."")

By contrast, in the wake of the revelation last week that Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont suffered a heart attack , that gendered line of questioning has been noticeably absent from political chatter. Sanders, instead, has received the kid-gloves treatment.

Each of these examples is, in its own way, a distillation of age-old policing mechanisms and double standards. Each also shines a light on the inveterate sexism -- women as unreliable narrators, women as answerable for their husbands' professional lives, women as weak -- that still, today, takes up so much space in the narrative.

Or to use Warren's own words, ""I don't know what else you'd call it."""

Asked if he would put strong measures in place to increase oversight over health care access to LGBTQ asylum seekers if elected president, businessman Tom Steyer said, ""Of course we will.""

He took a shot at President Donald Trump and his treatment of migrants in US Immigration, Customs and Enforcement detention facilities.

""I think it's absolutely critical for the United States of America to treat people in a humane and decent fashion. It's very obvious that this President and this administration has chosen to not only break the international laws in their treatment of asylum seekers, but to break the basic laws of humanity,"" he said.

Steyer continued: ""When I think about why I started the need to impeach campaign two years ago, yeah, he's a criminal, it's true that he more than has earned impeachment, but it goes much beyond this and it goes to exactly this kind of issue. The actual President of the United States committing crimes against humanity, like this, in our name, is something that we should end right now. Certainly the first day of my presidency."""

But is she seriously eyeing another run?,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/09/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-2020/index.html,"(CNN) Hillary Clinton fired off another taunting tweet to President Donald Trump on Thursday, saying, ""It's becoming a challenge to keep up with the high crimes and misdemeanors.""

Clinton is carefully following the daily developments in the ongoing impeachment drama -- and is having fun at her former rival's expense -- but that doesn't mean she is seriously weighing another run for president, several of her friends and advisers tell CNN.

Clinton's recent reentry into the public sphere after months out of the limelight has led to speculation that she could be seriously considering a rematch with Trump. Those questions have been stoked by Clinton herself, who responded to a recent Trump tweet about her running again by simply saying, ""Don't tempt me, "" and joked with PBS' Judy Woodruff about a possible round two with the President.

""Maybe there does need to be a rematch,"" Clinton said jokingly. ""Obviously, I can beat him again."" Clinton bested Trump in the popular vote, but fell short in the Electoral College.

But Clinton's reemergence is more a product of fortuitous timing and feeling unencumbered than a genuine exploration of a 2020 run.

""No,"" said longtime Clinton friend and former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, when asked if Clinton is considering a run in 2020. ""I think she is having the time of her life and speaking her mind.""

McAuliffe, who was chair of Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, added: ""It drives Trump crazy. ... Trump and his massive ego cannot get over the fact that Hillary Clinton got 3 million more votes than he got. It drives him absolutely mad, so she is having fun shooting back at him.""

For Clinton, the moment is a twofold opportunity: promoting her book and taunting Trump. And friends who have spent time with her in recent weeks say she's enjoying both in equal measures.

""Yes, she loves taunting him. As much now as ever,"" a person close to Clinton told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. ""She's having fun, but that doesn't mean she's going to run again.""

Clinton, after writing ""The Book of Gutsy Women: Favorite Stories of Courage and Resilience"" with her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, was always planning a lengthy book tour. Little did she know, however, that she would kick off the tour mere hours before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the beginning of an impeachment inquiry into Trump.

That unexpected timing, aides said, meant Clinton was going to be far more public at the same time that Trump's presidency faced its most existential threat. Trump continues to bring up Clinton, tweeting about her regularly and often using questions around her email use as secretary of state to deflect from questions about his own legal issues.

Nick Merrill, Clinton's longtime spokesman, said the former nominee is ""not going to take (Trump's attacks) lying down.""

""She is out on a book tour,"" Merrill said, ""and she is having a little fun.""

One longtime loyal supporter said Clinton's jabs at Trump have created a fear among those close to her that she could ultimately consider a rematch, which many people believe would end badly for her.

""A lot of people are talking to her, which isn't helpful,"" another person close to Clinton told CNN. ""They get into her head because she so dislikes Donald Trump that she can't see straight.""

All of this chatter -- much of which comes from longtime Clinton donors -- is focused on the notion of a rematch with Trump. Of course, should she decide to run -- again, highly unlikely -- she would face a Democratic primary fight in a far different landscape than the 2016 campaign.

""Sure, she thinks about it,"" said McAuliffe of another Clinton presidential run, ""but she is also realistic.""

Still, some friends email her political gambling sites, showing her with a strong chance of defeating Trump. Newspaper columns floating the idea of her running always make their way into her inbox, including one last week from former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.

""She feels vindicated on everything she felt during the campaign,"" a person close to Clinton said. ""She's been proven right. Does that mean she will run again? No.""

A longtime confidante put it more bluntly: ""She is NOT running.""

Clinton has, however, been directly involved with the 2020 race and is deeply immersed in its day-to-day machinations. She keeps up with the swirl of news around the large field of Democrats vying to take on Trump and, according to advisers, has talked to nearly all of the 2020 Democrats.

That includes recent conversations with former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the race's two front-runners, as well as in-person meetings with candidates like Sen. Kamala Harris of California, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and others. Clinton has not talked to Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an adviser said, who is running for the nomination again after challenging Clinton in 2016.

While Clinton has been involved in the 2020 primary behind the scenes, she does not plan to endorse in the contest, people close to her said.

Clinton's recent bluntness has been a stark break from how she was as a candidate in 2016, where she was more guarded and careful.

This shift was recently made clear when, during a book tour interview, Clinton replied to a question about the gutsiest thing she ever did with an answer that took even some of her advisers by surprise.

""I think the gutsiest thing I've ever done -- well, personally -- make the decision to stay in my marriage,"" Clinton told ABC, referring to her husband, then-President Bill Clinton, having an affair with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky in the 1990s.

""She feels unconstrained, free to speak her mind,"" said Merrill. ""Watch her on this book tour. It's liberating.""

This story has been updated with Hillary Clinton's tweet from Thursday."

Follow him on Twitter: @DavidALove . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) While polls suggest Joe Biden leads among black voters, please read the fine print. Although Barack Obama's vice president touts his African-American support by saying ""I think they know me,"" in reality that support is conditional, more specifically generational, and therefore flimsy and tenuous.

Biden enjoys widespread support among older black adults, leaving some younger black voters to try to convince their parents and grandparents to change their ways and shift their vote for the 2020 election.

Black millennials and Gen Z-ers are proactively attempting to sway their elder family members away from Biden and towards progressive candidates, as the New York Times reported in September. While it's unclear if the attempt to specifically sway older black voters is working, according to an October Quinnipiac poll , Biden's support among black registered Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters has dropped 17 points since their July poll.

Biden has downplayed this black generational gap, suggesting the votes of older and moderate blacks are all he may need to get him over the top. However, it should come as no surprise that Biden has a young black people problem.

While his age, 76, has been mentioned as an issue, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are also in his age group -- and yet their age, until Sanders' recent heart attack, has not emerged as a factor.

But what has proven a roadblock for Biden's support among young people of color is the shelf life of his mindset, his decades-old sentiments on race, society and politics that seem to lock him into the 1960s and 1970s. Add to that Biden's perceived persona of white moderation that tells black people we should move in baby steps rather than seek aggressive and immediate change.

During the third Democratic debate, when asked about slavery and reparations, Biden responded with references to black parents unable to raise their children, and by telling them to ""make sure you have the record player on at night."" At that moment, Biden sounded out of touch -- more like a white man blaming black people for their oppression.

While Obama sometimes lectured young black people, as he did during his 2013 commencement address to Morehouse College, he was able to get away with it because he was the black president, familiar with the hardships that black Americans face. And although Biden enjoys touting his proximity to Obama, it comes off as condescending when the former vice president addresses the black community about inequalities that plague it.

When Biden recently spoke at an LGBTQ presidential forum, he appeared out of touch with present-day criminal justice realities by insisting yet again that his 1994 crime bill did not increase mass incarceration.

""That act was overwhelmingly supported by the African-American community, overwhelmingly supported by the community at large. Everyone from Ted Kennedy on voted for it. It did not have mandatory life sentences in it. That wasn't what it was about,"" Biden argued.

Yes, the bill was supported by many black leaders at the time. And yes, studies have shown that incarceration rates were on a steady incline prior to the bill. But to repeatedly dismiss arguments that the bill had a role in increasing the mass incarceration rates, and how it continues to impact communities of color, is shortsighted.

For young black voters the denial of the crime bill's effects may bring to mind how it had a part in creating a flawed criminal justice system that allowed for the killers of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and Philando Castile to walk free while many people of color are serving lengthy prison sentences for doing far less.

A tone-deaf Biden once said that young people -- not specifically black -- who think these days are as hard as the 1960s have no right to complain.

""The younger generation now tells me how tough things are — give me a break,"" he told the Los Angeles Times last year. ""No, no, I have no empathy for it, give me a break.""

Perhaps Biden would have more credibility had he not been one of the most ardent supporters of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which makes it exceedingly difficult for people to discharge their student loan debt when they file for bankruptcy unless they can prove undue hardship.

America is suffering from a $1.65 trillion student-debt crisis amid soaring tuition rates. Blacks are hit particularly hard, with 85% of black college students holding debt compared to 69% of white students. Black people owe an average of $34,000, which is $4,000 more than their white counterparts.

And, according to the Brookings Institution , black students have three times the default rate. The racial wealth gap means black people have less accumulated wealth and borrow more than whites, and, as victims of institutional discrimination, are targeted by for-profit institutions.

A new generation of black voters does not need lectures on parenting skills or how to win the contest for black respectability. Young black adults are spending their time supporting their families and raising their children.

They are struggling against the impact of climate change that will hit their own communities hardest, while also fighting racial injustice and mass incarceration exacerbated by the 1994 crime bill Biden championed with pride. Not to mention, black voters are suffering from an historic loss of wealth since the Great Recession -- a subprime mortgage crisis from which homeowners, unlike Wall Street, never received a bailout.

But for young black voters watching the recent rise of white nationalism, Biden's history of being ""civil"" with segregationists (his word) is alarming.

As the 2020 election heats up, Biden may be feeling confident about securing the black vote, but it would be a mistake for him not to think about younger black voters, an influential part of this crucial voting bloc. For them, ""President Biden"" is not a solution to the social, economic and environmental issues that they face."

Schweizer elaborated on his Wednesday-published New York Times opinion editorial in a same-day interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host and Washington Post columnist Henry Olsen.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-KY) financial relationship with the Chinese state is illustrative of the status quo of foreign business relationships between politicians and foreign governments evading disclosure requirements, explained Schweizer.

The family of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who is McConnell’s wife, owns a seafaring shipping business, noted Schweizer. “They had it even before Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao were married, but in 1993 … the Chinese government basically struck a deal with the Chao family, where they said, ‘We will finance the construction of your cargo ships. We will provide crews for your cargo ships, and state-owned enterprises in China will give you lots of contracts to ship our goods around Asia.'”

Schweizer continued, “And what you’ve seen as that relationship has budded, is basically that Mitch McConnell has become a lot less critical of the Chinese government, and this is essentially what the Chinese are playing at. They’ve done it in Australia. They’ve done it in New Zealand [and] other parts of Asia. They are quite confident that the way to deal with adversarial countries or countries that are resistant to their policies is essentially [is to] try to buy off the political class, and they’ve had some success in doing that, and they’re doing that in the United States today.”

LISTEN:

Schweizer noted how Joe Biden’s geopolitical analysis of China changed following his youngest son, Hunter Biden, launching a private equity firm with $1.5 billion in financing from the Chinese state.

“Joe Biden was basically a hawk on China for most of his Senate career in the ’80s and ’90s, even up until the early parts of the Obama administration,” Schweizer remarked. “Joe Biden has basically said, ‘We should welcome a rising China. China is not a threat. There is benefit to China becoming stronger, because they will be more like us.'”

“China is going to eat our lunch? C’mon man,” said Biden in May, further dismissing China as a geopolitical threat, “They’re not a competition for us.”

Olsen contrasted news media focus on alleged foreign-rooted conflicts of interest between President Donald Trump and those of Joe Biden via Hunter Biden’s business dealings in China and Ukraine.

“The thing that gets me is that Hunter Biden is obviously a troubled individual,” Olsen stated. “The New Yorker magazine profile of him goes into enormous detail about his troubles. For three years, we’ve been hearing about every little thing about the Trump children or the Trump administration, and how awful it is that foreign dignitaries stay at the Trump Hotel in DC because they might be currying favor with the president, and how terrible it is that Chinese investors are buying condos in Jared Kushner’s family’s buildings, and yet here we’ve got this troubled person, who Joe Biden obviously loves, who is raking in cash well beyond his expertise, and supposedly we’re not supposed to be worried about it. The double standard here is just glaring.”

Olsen added, “It’s almost like you can imagine some sort of shakedown deal. You can almost imagine somebody going up to [Joe Biden] and saying, ‘Nice son you’ve got there. Shame if something were to happen to him.’ It’s very troubling. You don’t even have to say that [Joe Biden] has changed his mind [on China.] The fact is Hunter Biden’s future is now indebted to people and regimes that are potentially hostile to the United States, and definitely regimes that we want to have an interest in, and he, unfortunately, has a personal stake [in this] because of his son’s involvement. That’s news, and it’s as much news as when the president of Ukraine says, ‘Oh, I stayed in the Trump Tower when I was in New York.’ In fact, I’d say it’s even more so.”

Asked by Mansour for solutions to combating foreign procurement of political influence through business relationships with politicians’ family members, Schweizer proposed legislation modeled after the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

“Here’s the paradox,” replied Schweizer, “A few years ago … one of [J.P. Morgan’s] subsidiaries was fined hundreds of millions of dollars by the federal government of the United States because what their subsidiary did was hire the children of Communist Party officials in China with the explicit hope of getting favorable treatment from the Chinese government. So they paid a large fine for that, and that violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which means you are not allowed to provide a favor or a benefit to a foreign government officials in exchange for favorable treatment.”

Schweizer continued, “Here’s the problem. It’s called the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for a reason. It does not apply in the United States. If J.P. Morgan did what they did in China and got fined for — if they did the same thing in the United States — it would be completely legal and acceptable. And to me, that should be unacceptable. The notion that American corporations are not allowed to buy foreign politicians — but foreign corporations can buy American politicians — I don’t think is where we want to be as a country. I’m proposing [a] legislative solution that creates similar barriers to hiring the family members of politicians in the United States.”

Without identifying specific persons, Schweizer revealed that he had discussed the aforementioned legislative proposal with some senators.

“I recognize it’s not going to be easy to get passed,” said Schweizer of the Washington Corrupt Practices Act. “You’ve people on both sides of the aisle that want to cash in, but I think this is key, or we’re going to continue to see in this country a descent into more corruption, into kind of a third-world swamp where the political class is getting rich and their interests are not aligned with the populace; their interests are aligned with foreign oligarchs or companies that are paying them.”

“At a very minimum … there ought to be a disclosure,” Schweizer continued. “If Joe Biden or Mitch McConnell are running for office, they’re required to disclose a $200 donation from anybody. It’s required by federal law, and the reason is we want to know who’s putting money in their campaign coffers if that person is getting favorable treatment or influence. And they’re also required to disclose if they have $1000 in stock in General Electric, because we want to make sure their decisions are not being marred by their own financial interests. So they have to disclose those things. But their adult child, like Hunter Biden, joins a Chinese firm — a billion-dollar firm funded by the Chinese government — there’s no disclosure requirement.”

Existing disclosure requirements related to campaign contributions and investment are insufficient to reveal potential conflicts of interest between politicians and foreign states, noted Schweizer. “I would argue that if you are a foreign entity, the best way to get influence over an American politician is not by making a $200 campaign contribution, it’s not by hoping they own $1000 of your stock, it’s by striking a lucrative deal with one of their kids, and yet there’s no disclosure requirement. At a minimum, we should require American politicians [and] elected officials in senior government positions [to disclose] if their immediate family members have deals with foreign governments. They should be required to disclose that and let citizens know that.”

The Washington Corrupt Practices Act may yield bipartisan support, speculated Schweizer.

“This has the prospect of a kind of populist left-right legislative approach,” Schweizer estimated. “Imagine if you could have a Ted Cruz, [a] conservative Republican, and an [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], who is really a left-wing socialist in Congress, both of them [support this]. This is the sort of issue I think resonates with them and their view of Washington. They’re suspicious of the establishment. They see this as corrupt and I’m hoping that we can find common cause.”

Schweizer added, “That’s what happened with the STOCK Act. You had conservative Republicans in the Freedom Caucus [and] left-wing Democrats in New York who all said, ‘It’s outrageous. They shouldn’t be trading stock in this way. We need to place some restrictions on it.’ I think this has the same marker. The biggest challenge you’re going to have is with leadership. Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell, they’ve been there for a long time. They like to set aside these kinds of perks for themselves. They don’t like to place restrictions on fellow members of Congress. I think you have reform-minded people in both parties, and I just think they need to have the courage to step up and say, ‘You know what? We need to have a legislative solution to this,’ and I think it’s going to be very hard for the leadership to resist a move, because these are not issues where you’re going to find even five percent of the American people who think this is a good idea. Most Democrats and most Republicans think this is terrible and needs to stop.”

Olsen concluded, “Sounds to me like the one thing Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and President Trump could all agree on.”

But the biggest issue on the table now revolves around what happens in Mexico.,2019-10-09,CNN,GM's Mexican factories - Why ending the UAW strike will be so hard,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/09/business/uaw-gm-plant/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) The talks to resolve the longest auto industry strike in decades have taken place in downtown Detroit for 24 straight days. But the biggest issue on the table now revolves around what happens in Mexico.

The United Auto Workers union, whose nearly 50,000 members have been on strike against General Motors since Sept. 16, has previously made shifting work back from plants in Mexico to plants in the United States a major issue in the talks. But it is a bigger factor this year, after GM announced plans to close four US plants . While many other matters have been resolved, there remains a huge chasm between the two on that point.

Three plants -- an assembly line in Lordstown, Ohio , and transmission plants in Warren, Michigan ,and Baltimore -- have already halted production, while the Hamtramck assembly line in Detroit is slated to close early next year. The union wants to keep these plants alive by shifting production from Mexico.

Terry Dittes, the UAW's chief negotiator, sent an email to union members Tuesday saying GM's refusal to make such a shift is the biggest problem in the talks.

""We have made it clear that there is no job security for us when GM products are made in other countries for the purpose of selling them here in the USA,"" he wrote. ""We believe that the vehicles GM sells here should be built here. We don't understand GM's opposition to this proposition. Building more world-class vehicles at our UAW-GM locations is the best solution for our members, our families, our communities and GM.""

The union is still negotiating over other issues, including wages, profit sharing and GM's use of temporary workers. But Dittes said ""economic gains in this agreement will mean nothing without job security.""

In recent contracts, automakers have offered job security to the union with promises to invest in plants, as well as plans to build specific vehicles in specific plants. GM said its current offer includes plans to invest more than $7 billion in US plants, which would create or protect about 5,400 jobs.

GM said the overwhelming majority of the cars it sells in the US are built in the US. While it doesn't provide the number of cars built in Mexico, the company points out that it has four factories in Mexico, compared to 29 in the United States -- not counting the four it is planning to close. It also said it has proposed ""solutions"" for the Hamtramck and Lordstown plants

GM GM Fiat Chrysler FCAU Ford F Data released by the UAW from Ward's Automotive Reports showsproduced 834,000 cars and trucks in Mexico last year, about 30% more thanand roughly triple the number of cars built there by. Overall it sold about 3 million vehicles in the United States last year.

Beyond those four plants, the union is worried that other GM plants could be at risk of closure without shifting production back to United States from Mexico. With Lordstown and Hamtramck still in the equation, GM's US plants were operating at about 68% of capacity, said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor & economics at the Center for Automotive Research, a Michigan think tank. Without them it'll be above 80% of US capacity, she said.

""You want to be in the 85% to 90% range,"" she said.

The vehicles GM is building in Mexico are among its best selling - the Silverado and Sierra pickups, the Blazer, Equinox, Terrain and Trax SUVs. Of those vehicles, only the Silverado and Sierra are also made at US plants. Those are already working around the clock on three shifts turning out pickups. The Terrain and Blazer are built only in Mexico. The Trax is built in Mexico and South Korea, and the Equinox is built in Mexico and Canada.

Most of those vehicles are early in their product life cycle, such as the Blazer, which is in its first year of production. Typically if a vehicle is going to be shifted from one plant to another, it's when there is a major design change after at least five or more years.

""It cost billions of dollars to put them [in Mexico], and it'd cost billions of dollar to bring them back,"" said Dziczek. ""GM will be loath to move anything back that they just spent money to put there.""

In addition, GM is paying workers in Mexico a fraction of the more than $30 an hour that veteran UAW members make at US plants.

But not bringing product back from Mexico creates its own problems for GM. Any labor deal needs to be ratified by UAW membership before it can take effect. And with the plant closing plans, membership is focused on job security as a top issue.

""What GM needs is they need it to be able to be ratified,"" said Dziczek. ""Plants that get investment are plants that workers can feel will be around for a while."""

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Wednesday unveiled her plan to address ""environmental injustice"" and ""environmental racism,"" which includes a $1 trillion investment into minority communities affected by ""industrial pollution.""",2019-10-09,Breitbart News,Elizabeth Warren Touts Plan to Address ‘Environmental Racism’,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/09/elizabeth-warren-touts-plan-to-address-environmental-racism/,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Wednesday unveiled her plan to address “environmental injustice” and “environmental racism,” which includes a $1 trillion investment into minority communities affected by “industrial pollution.”

Warren argues that “justice” plays a massive role in properly addressing the climate change “crisis,” citing studies that suggest that black and Hispanic families are disproportionately affected by air pollution caused by white people:

A more recent study found that while whites largely cause air pollution, Blacks and Latinxs are more likely to breathe it in. Unsurprisingly, these groups also experience higher rates of childhood asthma. And many more low-income and minority communities are exposed to toxins in their water – including lead and chemicals from industrial and agricultural run-off.

Warren calls this phenomenon “environmental racism” and concludes that “environmental injustice is the result of decades of discrimination and environmental racism compounding in communities that have been overlooked for too long.”

She previewed her plan in a video clip featuring far-left “Squad” member Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).

“We need a government that’s on the side of families—not giant corporations polluting our communities. @RashidaTlaib and I walked through 48217, the most polluted zip code in Michigan, and talked with the families living every day with the effects of pollution,” Warren tweeted alongside the clip:

Like Warren’s other proposals, her environmental injustice plan weaves in aspects of her other campaign promises. For instance, Warren says her housing plan will provide an assistance program, aimed to get impoverished families out of poor, pollution-ridden neighborhoods and into the “neighborhood of their choice.”

She also pledges to invest one-third – or $1 trillion – of her climate change investment “into the most vulnerable communities,” although she does not specify what the $1 trillion will be spent on, specifically.

Like most of Warren’s plans, her environmental injustice proposal involves the implementation of another tax. In this instance, it is the “Superfund Waste Tax.”

Her plan states:

There are over 1300 remaining Superfund sites across the country, many located in or adjacent to frontline communities. So-called “orphan” toxic waste clean-ups were originally funded by a series of excise taxes on the petroleum and chemical industries. But thanks to Big Oil and other industry lobbyists, when that tax authority expired in 1995 it was not renewed. Polluters must pay for the consequences of their actions – not leave them for the communities to clean up. I’ll work with Congress to reinstate and then triple the Superfund tax, generating needed revenue to clean up the mess.

The presidential hopeful even weaves in Medicare for All as part of her broader proposal, arguing such a system will “make it easier for the federal government to quickly tailor health care responses to specific environmental disasters in affected communities when they occur.”

Warren also reiterates her pledge to “ensure that employers and our government honor the promises they made to workers in fossil fuel industries.”

“I’ve fought for years to protect pensions and health benefits for retired coal workers, and I’ll continue fighting to maintain the solvency of multi-employer pension plans,” she said. “As president, I’ll protect those benefits that fossil fuel workers have earned.”

However, Warren’s role in crafting a petition to the Supreme Court on behalf of LTV Steel – which helped the company’s “fight against a congressional requirement that it pay millions of dollars into a fund for its retired coal miners’ health care” – calls her promise into question.

“As I’ve traveled this country, I’ve heard the human stories from frontline communities. Families where many people have cancer. Coastal communities facing the threat of rising sea levels. Ruined land and poisoned water,” Warren tweeted.

“These communities need justice—and I will stand with them,” she added:

Industrial pollution has been concentrated in communities of color due to decades of discrimination and racism—and a system that puts corporate profits before people. We need big, structural change, focused on and led by members of those communities. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 9, 2019

As we work to enact the #GreenNewDeal, I'll make sure that frontline community leaders who know best what their neighborhoods need are elevated in my White House and lead the way toward the big, structural change we need. They've been doing this work for decades—we should listen. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 9, 2019

But we must ensure that we honor our commitments to fossil fuel workers as we transition to the new green economy. We'll ensure that new jobs have similar wages and benefits. And I'll fight to protect the pensions and benefits that they've earned. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 9, 2019"

As part of Warren’s “Empowering American Workers and Raising Wages” plan, illegal aliens who have worked illegally in the United States — sometimes by stealing Americans’ identities and Social Security numbers — would become eligible to receive back pay for their previous work by amending the National Labor Relations Act.

Warren writes:

Ensuring employers can’t exploit undocumented workers and drive down standards for all workers: The 2002 Supreme Court case Hoffman Plastic Compounds v. NLRB held that an undocumented worker could not receive the backpay he was owed from an employer who had violated the NLRA. That 5–4 ruling is wrong and denies millions of undocumented workers redress for illegal firings or other retaliatory conduct by an employer. The case encourages employers to hire undocumented immigrants and exploit them in numerous fields, including construction and manufacturing, which could lower wages for all workers. I will fight to amend the NLRA to end this form of exploitation and ensure that all workers are protected. [Emphasis added]

Despite her platform of populist economic patriotism, Warren has committed to driving up foreign competition against America’s working and middle class in the U.S. labor market by providing amnesty for 11 to 22 million illegal aliens, increasing current legal immigration levels, and decriminalizing illegal immigration.

Warren Undercuts Populist Agenda with Donor Class Immigration Planhttps://t.co/RAdJlUT44k — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) August 28, 2019

Absent from Warren’s workers plan is a mandate and punishment for employers and businesses who hire illegal aliens over American citizens, as well as a reform to the H-1B visa program whereby Americans are readily replaced by foreign visa workers to increase profit margins for multinational corporations.

Warren has not endorsed mandatory E-Verify — a system that prevents businesses from hiring illegal aliens over Americans — though it would decrease foreign competition against Americans, especially those most vulnerable to competing against illegal aliens in the labor market.

In contrast to Warren is President Trump’s populist-nationalist “Buy American, Hire American” agenda, which has sought to increase interior immigration enforcement to tighten the labor market and delivered wage hikes for America’s blue-collar and working class. Unlike Warren, Trump’s latest national immigration plan includes a nationwide mandate of E-Verify to prevent Americans from being forced to compete for jobs against illegal aliens.

Today, there are at least eight million illegal aliens holding American jobs in the U.S. economy that would have otherwise gone to American workers and legal immigrants. In most cases, these illegal workers obtain fraudulent work authorization documents or steal American citizens’ identities in order to take jobs.

Warren, who has touted her campaign as 100 percent grassroots-funded, refused to say if she would require that her running mate not attend big-money fundraisers.

“Is your vice presidential pick going to also try and avoid those high-dollar fundraisers as well?” a reporter asked.

Warren refused to answer the question directly, calling it “a little premature” and essentially leaving the door open for her potential running mate to attend high-dollar fundraisers, which she prides herself on avoiding.

“You know, I think it’s a little premature to be talking about vice presidential. We’re still in primary here, and I’m working hard on this,” she said.

But look, I want a vice presidential partner, someone who’s going to get out there and fight for the same values,” she added:

Warren’s claims of a 100 percent grassroots-funded campaign have been called into question, particularly following a report that indicated she used millions in leftover funds – $10.4 million – from her 2018 senatorial bid to cushion her presidential campaign. At the time, Warren happily courted big donors and attended fundraisers, causing some to question her commitment to a true grassroots operation.

Former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell (D) contributed $4,000 to Warren in 2018 and noted her sudden change of heart.

As Breitbart News reported:

Rendell cohosted a Biden fundraiser earlier this year. To his surprise, the Warren campaign slammed the event as “a swanky private fund-raiser for wealthy donors” – despite the fact that Warren benefitted from similar events in the recent past. “She didn’t have any trouble taking our money the year before,” Rendell said, according to the Times. “All of a sudden, we were bad guys and power brokers and influence-peddlers. In 2018, we were wonderful.”

Warren also attended fundraisers hosted by billionaires– specifically Henry and Marsha Laufer.

As the New York Times reported:

In Florida, she was hosted for an event by the billionaires Henry and Marsha Laufer. In New York, Meyer S. Frucher, the vice chairman of Nasdaq, held a reception for her. She was hosted by the “Lost” creator Damon Lindelof and his wife, Heidi, in Southern California. The philanthropist Stephen M. Silberstein had Ms. Warren over to his San Francisco-area home. And as late as the fall of 2018, she visited Silicon Valley, where Karla Jurvetson, a multimillion-dollar Democratic contributor, hosted an event for her.

Warren’s campaign reported $24.6 million raised in the third quarter, less than $1 million short of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) $25.3 million. Approximately 940,000 contributions comprised the third-quarter haul, having an average donation of $26."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), on Wednesday, arguing that the country is “not electing a planner.”

While the top-tier candidates in the Democrat primary field have largely refrained from taking deep digs at one another, Biden signaled that he may switch strategies.

“We’re not electing a planner,” Biden said in New Hampshire on Wednesday, in an apparent reference to Warren. “I’ve been there. I know what it takes to get it done.”

Warren has made “I have a plan for that” a catchphrase of her campaign, claiming to have solutions for virtually every major problem the country faces and outlining those broad plans in a series of Medium posts over the course of her campaign. Most of Warren’s plans contain a common thread, incorporating aspects from additional proposals within her political arsenal.

Warren has unveiled a $3 trillion climate change proposal inspired by former presidential candidate and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), a plan focused entirely on “honoring and empowering tribal nations and Indigenous peoples,” and a proposal to “end corruption in Washington.”

In August, Warren released her comprehensive criminal justice reform plan, which emphasized protections for “special populations” — such as LGBT individuals — and called for the elimination of private prisons.

In September, Warren added to her ultra-progressive agenda, promising to raise Social Security benefits by $200 per month. She said she would pay for it by taxing the “wealthy” — specifically, by increasing the Social Security contribution requirement to 14.8 percent for individuals making $250,000 per year, and splitting the 14.8 percent “equally between employees and employers at 7.4 percent each.”

Most recently, Warren released a plan to address “environmental injustice” and “environmental racism” across the country.

Biden’s jab comes after weeks of a slow, steady surge in Warren’s favor, besting Biden in a variety of recent polls and overtaking him in the RealClearPolitics average for the first time this week.

A poll from The Economist/YouGov showed Warren topping the field with 29 percent to Biden’s 25 percent — a lead which remains outside of the +/- 2.9 percent margin of error:

All bets are off. If foreign governments think they can tilt the playing field as they did against me, which was a deliberate, well planned out effort laid out in an indictments against Russian military actors and their allies– Well, you know, Republicans seem to think that, ‘Ok, so far Russia’s playing on the red team. You know. So we like it. We’re not going to stand up against it.’ Well, who’s to say that next week they’re going to be playing on the blue team? It’s crazy my friends.

However, Clinton failed to mention the well-documented Ukrainian efforts to sink Trump and boost her campaign.

The former secretary of state continued, calling the partisan-fueled impeachment inquiry the “appropriate remedy” to the “serious assault on our democracy that is apparently asked for.”

“So impeachment is the appropriate remedy, and it is such a serious assault on our democracy that is apparently asked for, aided and abetted by not only the president but his allies who seem not to either care or understand how deeply dangerous this is,” Clinton said.

“I am all in favor of what the House is doing and gathering the evidence and making the case because this president has to be held to account because of his unconstitutional abuse of power, his contempt of Congress, and his obstruction of justice,” she added.

President Trump suggested on Tuesday that “Crooked Hillary” should join the race “to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren” on the condition of explaining “all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting ‘C’ Subpoena!”

Clinton replied, “Don’t tempt me. Do your job,” fueling speculation that she is considering another presidential run.

Clinton recently floated the possibility of a rematch on PBS NewsHour:

You know, it truly is remarkable how obsessed he remains with me. But this latest tweet is so typical of him. Nothing has been more examined and looked at than my emails. We all know that. So, he’s either lying or delusional, or both. There was no subpoena, as he says in a tweet this morning. So, maybe there does need to be a rematch. I mean, obviously, I can beat him again. But, just seriously, I don’t understand, I don’t think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.

Clinton is expected to host “Dinner and a Conversation” in her Washington, DC, home this month in partnership with the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Women’s Leadership Forum, adding to the speculation of another presidential bid on the horizon."

“To preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached,” Biden said, accusing Trump of “shooting holes in the Constitution.”

Biden’s speech immediately drew mockery from the president as politically calculated.

“Joe’s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!” Trump wrote.

The president also shared a video on Twitter highlighting Biden and his son Hunter Biden’s alleged corruption in Ukraine.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren continues to rise in the polls as Biden’s big polling lead in the Democrat field continues to fall.

Biden’s campaign responded to Trump’s comment with a tweet of their own from the former vice president’s account.

The reason is simple: offending China’s regime can have serious business consequences. There is little risk to sales or profits from offending U.S. leaders or the American people by kowtowing to Chinese pressure.

“The price you pay for backing down to China is a week of Twitter opprobrium,” Jude Blanchette, the CSIS Freeman Chair in China Studies said in an interview on CNBC Tuesday. “Whereas the price you pay in China is the loss of market access.”

The NBA furor began when Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted his support for Hong Kong’s protesters.

That’s hardly a controversial position in the U.S., where there is widespread sympathy for the protesters who often wave U.S. flags and say they are inspired by America’s tradition of liberty, but it is beyond the pale for China’s leaders. Although Twitter is blocked in China, Morey’s message — and the Chinese regime’s disapproval — was echoed through official and unofficial channels over the weekend. The tweet was swiftly deleted, and the NBA expressed sorrow for the offending words.

That is now a familiar pattern. Companies as diverse as Marriot, Delta, United, Apple, Coach, Tiffany, Vans, and Activision/Blizzard have all apologized or changed politics or products when confronted by China. Hollywood explicitly caters its films to the Chinese markets, careful not to offend the sensibilities of China’s nationalists and ruling elite. Often outspoken leaders of big American banks, like J.P. Morgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon or former Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein, fall silent when it comes to China’s human rights abuses, growing totalitarianism, and even trade abuses.

It’s easy to see why the NBA does not want to get shut out of China. Last year, 490 million people watched online NBA broadcasts in China, the Wall Street Journal reported. And with 1.4 billion people, China is perhaps the biggest potential growth market for the league.

That too is familiar. U.S. companies have long viewed China’s enormous population, growing economy, and rising middle class as an irresistible opportunity. Even when they are forced to surrender half of their profits to free-riding Chinese “partners,” few have been willing to forego the lure of access to China’s consumers.

That has largely been a reflection of U.S. policy toward China. The U.S. has encouraged further entanglement with China. One administration after the other, Democrat and Republican, encouraged further economic engagement and discouraged conflict. Even as the costs to the U.S. in terms of lost jobs were far worse than expected and the benefits of what was once viewed as the inevitable Chinese liberalization proved illusory, the policy was largely unwavering. This both served the interests of corporate America, at least in the short-term, and conditioned corporate America to accept China’s demands upon them.

The corner offices in America’s corporate headquarters are now populated by executives who rose through this systemic bias in favor of China engagement. Companies and executives who might have resisted China’s increasingly stringent policing of criticism from around the globe were shunted aside. Betting on China was just how you won in corporate America for the last few decades.

Now that might be changing. President Donald Trump has taken aim at China’s trade practices and economic predation with his tariffs. Capitol Hill lawmakers such as Marco Rubio have challenged China’s plans for dominance in technology. Democratic hopeful Elizabeth Warren has been severely critical of China on human rights and workers’ rights.

The backlash against the NBA’s kowtow illustrates this. It has come from all over the political spectrum.

This is bigger than just the @NBA. It’s about #China’s growing ability to restrict freedom of expression here in the U.S. TV networks,airlines,hotel chains,retailers & Hollywood already self censor. Now private citizens risk losing their jobs if they offend China. https://t.co/DQOFdBkb1e — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 7, 2019

China is trying to use its market power to silence free speech and criticism of its conduct. In response, the NBA chose its pocketbook over its principles—and our values. We should all be speaking out in support of those protesting for their rights. https://t.co/IRiIY1cgDg — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 7, 2019

Wall Street Journal columnist Michael Bird is hopeful this could prompt a change in corporate America:

But firms will need to be more careful in the future. The NBA is discovering that groveling to Beijing is no longer a one-way street, as American politicians weighed in supporting Mr. Morey. The company’s strong brand in the U.S. could be tarnished if its executives are seen to be in the pocket of an autocratic government. Broad bipartisan support for Hong Kong protesters places businesses in political crosshairs they’d rather avoid.

And yet it might not amount to much — at least not without a policy follow-up.

As Blanchette points out, China still has the ability to punish U.S. companies that do no suppress speech critical of China. While the cost of kowtowing is simply a public relations embarrassment that is likely to pass. No one thinks Americans will quit watching professional basketball because the league was too cozy with China’s leadership.

In fact, even as the backlash mounted in the U.S., China kept up the pressure. State broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) on Tuesday issued a statement on the social media platform Weibo noting its “strong dissatisfaction and opposition” to comments made by the NBA commissioner Adam Silver, who had held a press conference in which he walked back the league’s kowtow and defended Morey’s freedom to express his opinion.

“We believe that any speech challenging a country’s national sovereignty and social stability is not within the scope of freedom of speech,” CCTV said.

China has a policy of defending its reputation against criticism that can hurt the profits of U.S. businesses that defy it. The U.S. has politicians saying critical things — a kind of virtue signaling — on Twitter.

Deadline reported that former Vice President Biden will attend two Hollywood fundraisers on Thursday — one in the afternoon hosted by former HBO executive Michael Lombardo, and one in the evening at the home of Paramount Pictures chairman and CEO Jim Gianopulos.

CNN’s town hall, titled Equality in America, is set to air Thursday evening, from 7:30 p.m. to 12 a.m. ET, and will feature nine Democratic presidential candidates. The event is co-organized by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, a non-profit focused on LGBTQ issues.

The town hall comes amidst increased U.S.-China tensions — a subject that hits close to home in the entertainment industry, which depends heavily on Chinese consumers to buy movie tickets and visit theme parks.

Hollywood executives have remained conspicuously quiet about U.S.-China relations in the wake of democracy protests in Hong Kong that have put global businesses including the NBA to Apple in a difficult spot.

President Donald Trump has publicly hammered Biden over his close ties with China, accusing the former Vice President and his son, Hunter, of being “paid off” by foreign interests.

Moderators of Thursday’s town hall include CNN’s Dana Bash, Anderson Cooper, Chris Cuomo, Don Lemon and Nia-Malika Henderson.

Sen. Harris (D-CA) reportedly attended a reception at The Abbey in West Hollywood on Wednesday, while Buttigieg is set to attend a fundraiser at the Belasco Theater in downtown L.A.

Deadline reported earlier this week that Buttigieg attended a separate L.A. fundraiser on Tuesday at the home of former CAA agent Michael Kives, who is now head of the investment advisory firm K5 Global.

Celebrities who were reportedly in attendance include Leonardo DiCaprio, Glenn Close, Ashton Kutcher and Paris Hilton.

Hollywood is a reliable fundraising pitstop for Democratic candidates.

Hillary Clinton made numerous L.A. visits in her failed 2016 bid for the White House, including events with mega donor and billionaire Haim Saban, the founder of Saban Entertainment.

CNN’s town hall is set to take place at the Novo, at the L.A. Live complex in downtown L.A.

Other Democratic presidential hopefuls scheduled to appear include Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Beto O’Rourke, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, Tom Steyer and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ).

Invitations to participate in the LGBTQ-focused town hall were extended to Democratic presidential hopefuls who met the DNC’s qualifications for the October 2019 primary debate. Candidates must have reached 2% in at least four national polls identified by the DNC to determine eligibility. The polls for this town hall must have been released between June 28, 2019 and September 25, 2019. In addition, candidates also needed to meet the donor threshold outlined by the DNC for the October debate, in which the candidates had to receive the financial support of 130,000 unique donors, including 400 donors each from at least 20 states. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and businessman Andrew Yang both declined HRCF’s invitation, each citing scheduling conflicts. A HRCF (Human Rights Campaign Foundation) spokesperson said the audience will be comprised of invited guests, LGBTQ stakeholders, and members of civic organizations. No public tickets will be available for the event.

McBath is in a vulnerable district, barely edging out former Rep. Karen Handel (R-GA) in 2018. McBath won by one percent, or 3,264 votes.

Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District tilted in Hillary Clinton’s favor in the 2016 election by 1.5 percent, although Trump ultimately won the state. However, as internal polling suggests, Democrats in key congressional districts face an uphill battle, as the majority of constituents do not consider Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky an impeachable offense, and that conversation largely serves as the basis for the partisan-fueled impeachment inquiry.

“Pro-Trump patriots showed up to @RepLucyMcBath‘s office in #GA06 this week to protest her support of Pelosi’s impeachment witch-hunt,” Donald Trump Jr. wrote.

“Sorry #LiberalLucy, you can’t vote for Pelosi for Speaker, support her impeachment witch-hunt and still call yourself a ‘moderate,'” he added. “#VoteHerOut”:

Continued worries about the possible unwinding of the Affordable Care Act — aka Obamacare — and renewed calls from the Trump administration and leading Democrats to push prescription drug prices lower are clouding the earnings outlook for many health care companies.

If Senator Elizabeth Warren continues to gain ground in the polls for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, that could add pressure to the group. Warren supports the Medicare For All single-payer plan backed by her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders.

Litigation worries are also a major concern. Look no further than, another Dow component.

Shares of J&J fell 2% Wednesday and were down slightly for the year after a jury in Pennsylvania ruled J&J must pay $8 billion in punitive damages following a man's claim that the company didn't warn young men that they could grow breasts after using the antipsychotic drug Risperdal.

J&J was not immediately available for comment about whether it planned to appeal the judgment. However, the company did say in a statement that ""this award is grossly disproportionate"" with the original $680,000 compensatory award paid in the case, and that J&J was confident the $8 billion award — which it called ""unfounded"" — would be overturned.

The company is also dealing with a series of other legal problems, including allegations of asbestos in baby powder and the company's role in the opioid addiction crisis . A number of other pharmaceutical companies are also facing legal battles.

Earnings aren't expected to rise all that dramatically for major health care companies, which is a problem when investors have better growth opportunities in sectors like tech and retail. Profits for Pfizer and Walgreens are expected to be flat in 2020.

What's more, health care stocks may not catch on as a defensive play, either. Conservative investors have more attractive options among sectors that pay bigger dividends.

Utilities and real estate stocks are market winners this year in part because of their yields, which are higher than the under 1.6% for 10-year US Treasury bonds.

Utilities Select Sector SPDR XLU Real Estate Select SPDR XLRE Theandeach have an average dividend yield of 2.9% while the Health Care ETF has a yield of about 1.7%.

In other words, health care stocks don't offer enough safety and stability for defensively oriented investors if the economy goes south. And their profits aren't rising at a fast enough clip to lure growth investors from more dynamic sectors if the market rally continues.

So health care stocks seem trapped in a no man's land."

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), a former chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, announced her endorsement of the former vice president on Tuesday, claiming to have witnessed Biden’s “fortitude” and leadership during their overlapping tenures in Congress.

Feinstein said in a statement:

I’ve worked closely with Vice President Biden and I’ve seen firsthand his legislative ability, his statesmanship, and most importantly his moral fortitud. During his time in Congress and in the White House, Joe Biden has been a tireless fighter for hard working American families.

The endorsement comes as Biden’s presidential campaign is besieged by scandal regarding the lucrative business dealings his youngest son, Hunter, had with foreign governments.

Only hours before Feinstein’s endorsement, the Chinese government announced it would not investigate how Hunter Biden ended up at the center of one its top private equity firms. The Chinese foreign ministry made the decision after President Donald Trump publicly called for a probe of Hunter Biden’s dealings with Bohai Harvest RST (BHR). In particular, Trump has noted that the circumstances surrounding BHR’s creation could have posed a conflict of interest for Joe Biden.

As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, revealed in his bestselling book Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden inked the multibillion-dollar deal that created BHR with a subsidiary of the state-owned Bank of China in 2013.

The timing of the lucrative deal has been brought into question as it came only 12 days after Hunter visited China with his father aboard Air Force Two. Officially, the then-vice president was visiting the country amid escalating tensions over islands in the South China Sea and decided to bring his granddaughter and son along. In a March 2018 interview with Breitbart News Tonight, however, Schweizer detailed the political machinations that preceded Hunter Biden’s $1.5 billion venture with China:

In December of 2013, Vice President Joe Biden flies to Asia for a trip, and the centerpiece for that trip is a visit to Beijing, China. To put this into context, in 2013, the Chinese have just exerted air rights over the South Pacific, the South China Sea. They basically have said, ‘If you want to fly in this area, you have to get Chinese approval. We are claiming sovereignty over this territory.’ Highly controversial in Japan, in the Philippines, and in other countries. Joe Biden is supposed to be going there to confront the Chinese. Well, he gets widely criticized on that trip for going soft on China. For basically not challenging them, and Japan and other countries are quite upset about this.

Since its creation, BHR has invested heavily in energy and defense projects across the globe. As of June, Hunter Biden was still involved with BHR, sitting on its board of directors and owning a minority stake of the fund estimated to be worth more than $430,000.

Such dealings at the center of politics and business, while perhaps not illegal, are not exclusive to the Biden family alone. As a few noted at the time of Feinstein’s endorsement, the senator and her husband have their own close ties to the communist country.

During her tenure as mayor of San Francisco in the late-1970s and early-1980s, Feinstein took advantage of the newly normalized diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China by establishing one of the first sister city partnership between San Francisco and Shanghai. Through that partnership, Feinstein led trade delegations to China in which she and her husband, Richard Blum, became acquainted with some of the country’s most prominent political leaders.

As the Federalist noted in August 2018, Feinstein and her husband leveraged those relationships to boost their own wealth. In 1986, Feinstein and Jiang Zemin — the then-mayor of Shanghai, who would later ascend to the presidency of the People’s Republic of China — “designated several corporate entities for fostering commercial relations.” One of those firms was Shanghai Pacific Partners, which employed Blum as a director. Blum reportedly had an interest of upwards of $500,000 in a project backed by Shanghai Pacific Partners.

After Feinstein was elected to the Senate in 1992, Blum continued profiting off their ties to China. A the same time, the freshman lawmaker was pitching herself as a “China hand” to colleagues, even once claiming “that in my last life maybe I was Chinese.” Through her seat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Feinstein led the fight on a number of initiatives seen as being favorable to China, including granting the country permanent most-favored-nation trading status in 2000.

Despite Feinstein and her husband having a close relationship with Jiang, the Chinese government targeted the senator as part of its espionage operations. In the early 2000s, the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) recruited a longtime employee of the senator to gather information about the inner workings of her congressional and district offices. Feinstein only learned of the staffer’s duplicity in 2013, after he’d already been on her payroll for more than 20 years.

“While this person, who was a liaison to the local Chinese community, was fired, charges were never filed against him,” Politico reported in 2018, speculating that because “the staffer was providing political intelligence and not classified information—making prosecution far more difficult.”

Apart from the convoluted history of the senator’s ties to China, the political timing of Feinstein’s endorsement also caught many off guard. The California Democrat, who hosted a fundraiser on Biden’s behalf last week alongside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) daughter, is only the most recent figure from the Democrat establishment to openly pledge support for the former vice president. Feinstein’s endorsement, however, was not totally expected, especially since her seamate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), is mounting a bid of her own for the Democrat nomination. In fact, earlier this year, Feinsten flirted with the notion of remaining neutral in the 2020 contest out of respect for Harris.

Compounding the political picture is that most polls show Biden no longer the favorite to win California, having fallen behind Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

Feinstein, however, did not address any of that when endorsing the former vice president on Tuesday. Instead, the senator offered platitudes about Biden’s work to enhance gun control and how his campaign was a “fight to restore the soul of the nation.”"

Schiff also allegedly lied about having never spoken to the Ukrainian intelligence officer “whistleblower.”

Congressman Biggs’ legislation has quickly gained support throughout the House Republican Conference. Support for the resolution extends from the House Freedom Caucus conservatives to moderates and House GOP leadership.

On Monday, the resolution had 73 sponsors, and support for the bill has reached triple digits as of Wednesday afternoon.

The bill’s growing list of Republican sponsors shows the GOP has moved to defend President Donald Trump against House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry.

When Biggs sponsored the bill, he said Schiff’s stunt was “inexcusable” to “mislead the American public with such a statement.” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), and House Republican Conference chairwoman Liz Cheney (R-WY) have sponsored the resolution to condemn Schiff.

But others argue that even if she goes on to win the presidency, that won't be a problem for Wall Street or the economy.",2019-10-11,CNN,What would an Elizabeth Warren presidency mean for the economy and markets? - CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/11/investing/elizabeth-warren-stock-market-economy/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) The possibility that Elizabeth Warren could win the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination — and perhaps even defeat Donald Trump — is starting to unnerve some in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street.

But would a President Warren actually be a bad thing for big business and the stock market?

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees this summer that a Warren White House would not be good for the social media networking company, because of her calls to break upand other big tech companies.

Tech news site The Verge reported earlier this month that, according to leaked audio clips, Zuckerberg said ""if [Warren] gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah.""

And a recent survey by RBC Capital Markets showed that investors are nervous about Joe Biden's poll numbers and Warren's ascent.

""Investors clearly think Biden is better for the stock market than Warren,"" said Lori Calvasina, head of US equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, in the report. In fact, Warren was viewed as ""the least market friendly"" candidate, Calvasina noted.

Warren has a populist platform and has talked about doing more to regulate the financial, tech, health care and energy industries. She has also proposed a wealth tax of 2% annually on households with a net worth above $50 million and 3% on households with a net worth higher than $1 billion.

So it's understandable why Wall Street has concerns about Warren.

The reasons why Warren wouldn't tank the stock market

Still, some experts think that worries about Warren are way overdone.

For one, few believe that the Senate will flip to Democratic control in 2020 — even if President Trump loses his reelection bid.

So there are limits to how much a President Warren could do with executive orders if Congress is split, said Matt Daly, a managing director and head of corporate credit research at Conning.

And a Warren win could boost some parts of the market and economy, Daly told CNN Business. He pointed to clean energy and infrastructure as sectors that likely would benefit if Warren were to win the race for the White House.

Even though Mark Zuckerberg may not be a fan of the Massachusetts senator, other leaders in the tech industry support Warren's candidacy.

Big Tech starting to warm to Warren

According to a Vox/Recode story earlier this month, numerous tech insiders said they liked Warren because of her rigorous approach to coming up with policy ideas. Many also viewed her as a more palatable alternative to Bernie Sanders, who is also on the far-left, progressive side of the Democratic party.

Alphabet GOOGL Amazon AMZN Apple AAPL Microsoft MSFT AT&T T Disney DIS IBM IBM To that end, employees and PACs tied to Google ownerandare listed by the Center for Responsive Politics' OpenSecrets.org site as among the biggest donors to Warren's campaign. CNN ownerandwere also among the top 20 contributors.

Analysts at tech, media and telecom research firm MoffettNathanson don't seem worried about Warren either, noting that there's a difference between campaign rhetoric and actual policy.

""We're relatively sanguine. Sure, a Warren presidency would heighten regulatory risks. But a Warren presidency would heighten regulatory risks for lots of industries,"" the MoffettNathanson analysts said in a report. The analysts added that ""her platform has more planks than a pirate ship; she's got plans for everything.""

Warren has also talked tough about China. That actually could be good for the markets, despite current concerns about the trade war.

Even though Trump's tactic of imposing more tariffs on China has hurt American companies and consumers — including from China's retaliatory measures — there is support in the business community for Washington to enforce intellectual property rights more forcefully with Beijing.

Warren would probably continue that approach. So it may not be in China's best interests to drag out trade talks and hope that it will no longer have to deal with Trump in 2021 if Warren continues to gain ground in the polls.

""There is growing consensus that China may hold out, trying to 'run out the clock' on the Trump administration through next November. These dynamics are changing, however, as Elizabeth Warren emerges and Joe Biden fades,"" said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide, in a report this week.

""Warren is running on populist policies and could be as challenging an adversary to the Chinese than Trump,"" Hackett added.

Continued pressure on China in a Warren White House?

A likely strong approach to dealing with China is a key reason why Kyle Bass, founder of the Hayman Capital Management hedge fund, said he is backing Warren too.

Bass told CNN Business in August that he would ""immediately"" vote for Warren because of her stance on China. She has criticized the country's environmental and labor/human rights policies and has also accused China of currency manipulation.

It's also worth noting that Wall Street was initially wary of Barack Obama in 2008 because of similar fears about the prospects for tougher regulations on the health care and financial sectors. (Of course, Wall Street was scared about lots of things unrelated to politics in 2008, such as the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the Great Recession.)

But the Obama presidency wound up being far more friendly to businesses than many had expected. So the same thing could happen if Warren wins the White House."

Elizabeth Warren seeks to put the social media giant on the defensive — by telling a lie.

The ads, which began running widely on Thursday, start with a bold but obvious falsehood: That Facebook and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg have endorsed President Trump's reelection campaign.

""You're probably shocked,"" reads the ad, which has already reached tens of thousands of viewers nationwide. ""And you might be thinking, 'how could this possibly be true?' Well, it's not.""

The ad's own admission of a lie seeks to draw attention to a controversial Facebook policy Warren has spent days criticizing. Under the policy, Facebook exempts ads by politicians from third-party fact-checking — a loophole, Warren says, that allows Zuckerberg to continue taking ""gobs of money"" from Trump's campaign despite Trump's ads telling untruths about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.

On Saturday, Warren explained her ad was meant ""to see just how far"" the policy goes.

""We intentionally made a Facebook ad with false claims and submitted it to Facebook's ad platform to see if it'd be approved,"" she tweeted. ""It got approved quickly.""

Facebook's willingness to run the ad, she said, shows how the company prioritizes profits over protecting democracy.

Warren's escalating criticism of Zuckerberg highlights the backlash Facebook has faced as it has defended its policy on political advertising. Sen. Amy Klobuchar , another Democratic candidate, tweeted on Thursday that online platforms like Facebook need a ""truth standard for paid ads."" And Biden's campaign has compared Trump's ads to Russian-backed disinformation.

""Whether it originates from the Kremlin or Trump Tower, these lies and conspiracy theories threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections in America,"" Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo said on Tuesday.

In a statement Friday responding to Warren's ad, Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone said the company believes political speech should be protected.

""If Senator Warren wants to say things she knows to be untrue, we believe Facebook should not be in the position of censoring that speech,"" Stone said.

Facebook's policy on truthfulness in political ads has been in place for over a year, according to Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communications. In a recent speech, Clegg said Facebook demotes third-party content shared by politicians on its platform if it has been previously debunked by fact-checkers and rejects its inclusion in advertisements. That could include links, photos or videos created by others. But it does not cover misleading ads or other content created under politicians' own names.

The Warren ad puts Facebook in a challenging position, said Dave Karpf, an associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University.

""Either Facebook doesn't touch the ad and the ad is therefore noteworthy, or they touch the ad and it's noteworthy,"" he said. ""It's a smart tactical move.""

Warren has become one of Facebook's key antagonists after first calling for it and other Silicon Valley giants — such as Amazon, Google and Apple — to be broken up. But her rift with Facebook deepened after leaked audio published by The Verge revealed Zuckerberg fretting about the potential consequences of a Warren presidency.

""If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,"" Zuckerberg is heard saying at a companywide meeting. ""And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. ... But look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.""

Warren responded via Twitter, ""What would really 'suck' is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.

And earlier this week, she said Facebook ""already helped elect Donald Trump once. Now, they're deliberately allowing a candidate to intentionally lie to the American people.""

Other analysts say Facebook has made the right decision not to involve itself in regulating political speech. Lee Goodman, a former Republican chairman of the Federal Elections Commission, told CNBC Thursday that he believed Facebook's policy is ""fair"" because it ""doesn't want to be the arbiter and doesn't want to take sides in these political debates.""

Shannon McGregor, an assistant professor of communication at the University of Utah who has studied the impact of tech platforms on political speech, agreed that Facebook's policy provides greater transparency about its role in political discourse.

But she added that Facebook's efforts to remain neutral — particularly now, with respect to Warren — could itself affect the course of the 2020 campaign.

""The limits of what our political discourse is these days is, of course, largely shaped by these platforms where a lot of these politics happen,"" she said."

Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren .

The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents 1.4 million workers, is among the largest in the country. Over the last month or so, nearly a dozen candidates have sat down on-camera to make their cases to union voters. Nine hopefuls, including former Vice President Joe Biden, have signed a pledge promising their support on issues Teamsters members recently voted to prioritize ahead of the primary.

""I think the candidates are trying to resonate and talk about what issues are important to working people more than what they did last time (in 2016),"" Teamsters General President James P. Hoffa said in an interview. ""And I think they're doing a good job.""

Hillary Clinton finished nine percentage points ahead of President Donald Trump (51% to 42%) with union households in 2016. Democrats will hope that margin widens come 2020. Warren, Biden and Sanders have all actively sought labor support and appeared on picket lines with striking United Automobile Workers members. Sanders in particular has made labor a focal point of his campaign, and been a fixture alongside workers protesting for higher wages and a union.

To be eligible for the Teamsters' official backing, candidates -- including Trump -- must agree to a three-point pledge assuring their support for labor-friendly trade deals, federal efforts to enhance and protect collective bargaining rights, and legislative action to protect endangered pension funding. Union members can track the process on a new website launched late Thursday. The candidates are also being asked to promise official neutrality should their staffs, as a number have already done, move to unionize.

The Teamsters also announced plans to hold a candidate forum on December 7 in Iowa.

When the union chose Clinton over Trump in 2016, the announcement came in late August. Hoffa didn't specify when a choice would be made this time around, suggesting it might not come until, or after, the Democratic National Convention next summer in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The process, which is meant to more deeply engage candidates and rank-and-file union members, will culminate with Hoffa delivering a recommendation -- based in part on a survey of local leaders -- to the general executive board.

Hoffa pointed to the fluid nature of the crowded race, and the increased attention on labor issues, as reasons the Teamsters might take their time in picking a horse. So far, most major unions have been slower to jump behind a single candidate.

""This is changing so fast. You know, who would have imagined that Bernie would have a heart attack, who would imagined the controversy with regard to Biden and his son,"" Hoffa said. ""Those are unknown things. And there's always unknown things that happen in campaigns, especially when you have a long time like this.""

There are, however, already a number of clear divides among the candidates publicly vying for Teamster support. Most notable is their backing -- or opposition -- to ""Medicare for All"" single-payer health care, the signature proposal of Sanders' campaign. A number of labor leaders and some vocal union members have expressed concern over a move to Medicare for All.

Hoffa is among the skeptics.

""The Teamsters have health care for all. And I just think we have to educate (the candidates) on that issue. I can't believe they would say that we're going to give up our insurance,"" he said. ""That's something we would be very, very strong on. That's just not something that we would concede.""

Still, he spoke warmly of his and the union's relationship with all of the leading candidates -- and the efforts of union members to engage them on the trail. According to the union, Teamsters have made more than 100 contacts with candidates over the last three months, asking them 95 questions. Twenty Teamsters locals in 14 states, with a focus on the early-voting hubs, have taken active roles. Midwestern swing states like Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania will also see a burst of door-knocking, phone calls, text messaging and other digital outreach.

""I'm very heartened because I happen to know all these candidates. One way or another, over the years, we got to talk -- when Biden was vice president, Warren in the Senate. Bernie we've known for years and (New Jersey Sen. Cory) Booker we've known forever,"" Hoffa said. ""And all these people come together with a lot of experience and it's a very talented group of people."""

But she still needs to win over black voters,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/10/politics/elizabeth-warren-black-voters/index.html,"Charleston, South Carolina (CNN) At an annual awards dinner hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington, DC, last month, Rev. Jesse Jackson watched as a stream of attendees walked over to one 2020 Democratic candidate, looking to shake her hand, chat and take a photo together.

It was Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , being approached ""all night long,"" Jackson said: ""People coming across the room to get a picture.""

The overwhelmingly positive reception that Warren received at the black-tie CBC gala wasn't the first time the senator has stood out this year at a forum of a largely black audience. Warren received a standing ovation at the ""She The People"" conference this summer as she presented her idea for bringing down the maternal mortality rate among black women ; in June, Jackson lavished her with praise at the Rainbow Push conference; and Warren appeared to be a crowd favorite at Al Sharpton's National Action Network conference in April, when she spoke about the acute challenges facing African-American homeowners.

But as Warren continues a steady climb in the national polls and now shares the front-runner status with former Vice President Joe Biden, Warren confronts a tough political reality. Those standout moments, coupled with public praise from African American leaders and activists, have yet to fully translate to support among black voters

According to a Quinnipiac national poll released on Tuesday, Warren is the top-choice candidate for 20% of black Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters. It is a notable improvement from the 10% support Warren had among black voters in an August Quinnipiac survey, but Biden still remains well ahead in support among blacks, at 36%.

Whether Warren can continue to improve her standing with this critical demographic group will be particularly important in the early voting state of South Carolina. A recent CNN poll showed Biden with a strong lead in the state, with the support of 45% of black likely primary voters. The same survey showed Warren with only 4% support among black voters in the state.

In an earlier Quinnipiac poll released at the end of September, seven in 10 black voters said they would be ""excited"" if Warren were the Democratic nominee, and 60% said they had a favorable view of the senator. But around two in 10 black voters said they still had not heard enough about Warren to have a favorable or unfavorable view of her. In contrast, 70% of those black voters said they had a favorable view of Biden, and only 5% said they hadn't heard enough about the former vice president to have a positive or negative opinion of him.

It has not gone unnoticed that some of Warren's events in South Carolina have featured largely white audiences. And despite the warm reception at the CBC dinner, Warren has not received endorsements from any black lawmakers in that caucus, unlike Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris.

On Wednesday, after another ""walking tour"" through a Charleston, South Carolina, neighborhood, Warren held a roundtable meeting with local residents, activists and leaders.

Asked by CNN how she would win over black voters who are far more familiar with Biden, Warren responded: ""I'm showing up, because I think that's really important -- showing up and shaking hands and talking with people.""

State Sen. Marlon Kimpson, who joined Warren in the discussion and applauded her for visiting his constituents, told reporters that he believes Biden has a ""head start"" with black voters because of name recognition.

""But I caution all candidates: Things in the rear mirror are closer than they appear. It's a wide-open race, there are some built-in advantages based on name recognition, but all candidates including the vice president has to make the case,"" said Kimpson, who has not yet made an endorsement.

According to Jackson, who himself ran for President twice in the 1980s, he and Warren speak ""quite often."" The civil rights activists told CNN in an interview the senator has reached out to him periodically as she has mounted a bid for the White House.

""She appears to be fearless,"" Jackson said. He has not endorsed in the Democratic primary and said he is undecided on whether he will publicly back someone before the Iowa caucuses. ""People hear her and they respond to her. She has the capacity to arouse the base.""

""It's not enough to talk about black people as if we're a monolith""

The Warren campaign has sought to reach out to the black community through its policy plans.

From her student loan debt forgiveness plan to her housing proposal to plans on closing private prisons and assisting entrepreneurs of color, Warren has integrated measures aimed specifically at African Americans in many of her policy outlines. Asked about outreach the senator has been doing this year to the black community, the campaign also pointed to ""listening sessions"" she has held with black activists and leaders throughout the year, including in Philadelphia ahead of the Netroots Nation conference.

And even as early as the spring, Warren was spending time in the south, in states that hold contests in March after the all-important early states. In March, she visited the Mississippi Delta for a ""walking tours"" of Cleveland and Greenville, Mississippi, to promote her rural housing plan, and also held campaign events in Tennessee and Alabama.

Ashlee Marie Preston, an African American transgender activist who has endorsed Warren, said she spoke with several other Democratic candidates before settling on Warren. It was in some ways an unexpected choice, she said, particularly given that there are two black candidates in the Democratic race: Sens. Harris and Cory Booker.

""I think it's easy to talk about racism in America -- it's another thing to be specific about the different layers about structural racism and systemic racism and how it continues to stand as a barrier to the poor and disenfranchised communities,"" Preston said. ""It's not enough to talk about black people as if we're a monolith.""

Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party, which endorsed Warren last month, echoed Preston's sentiment.

""Identity is important but identity is insufficient. Simply because candidates happen to occupy the same racial identity of black voters doesn't mean it's in the bag for any candidate,"" Mitchell said. ""And black voters are incredibly sophisticated. They want to understand a candidate's history, a candidate's platform.""

Other African American Warren supporters -- particularly those who have known the senator voters will for years -- insist that her standing with black voters will improve as they get to know the candidate better.

""I'm troubled by the numbers in South Carolina, only because I know that folks in South Carolina don't know her like we know her -- members of the African American community in Boston,"" said Rev. Jeffrey Brown, an associate pastor of the 12th Baptist Church in Roxbury, Massachusetts.

For years, Warren has periodically attended services at the 12th Baptist Church, one of the oldest black churches in the Boston area. Brown said Warren personally calls to give him a heads-up before attending Sunday services, and that while he has asked her on multiple occasions to speak to the congregation, she has largely declined.

Remarking upon the Bible that Warren brings to church -- ""What I love about her Bible is that it's not brand new. And I've seen it. I've looked at it. It's a well-worn thing"" -- Brown said it is what he sees as the senator's understanding of the unique needs of African-Americans that leads him to believe that there is room for black support for Warren to grow.

But the reality is that Warren has less than four months left to introduce herself to black voters across the country and intensively court them, in contrast to the years she has had to get to know black voters in Massachusetts.

""I wish I could go down to South Carolina to some of these places and say look -- this is not a show... She's a real advocate for us,"" said Brown, who added he is ""a thousand percent"" behind Warren's candidacy. ""I wish I could go down there to some southern churches and preach about that."""

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris all unveiled plans to expand LGBTQ protections and promote equal rights on Thursday, the day of an LGBTQ town hall hosted by CNN and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation.

The three candidates, whose plans are all similar, list passing the Equality Act as a top priority. The bill, which has passed the House of Representatives but has not been taken up by the Senate, would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other civil rights laws to include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected characteristics.

Warren, Buttigieg and Harris, along with several other 2020 Democrats, have been vocal about LGBTQ issues and rights throughout their presidential campaigns. Buttigieg stands out in the crowded 2020 Democratic field as someone who, if elected, would be the first man married to a same-sex partner to be president of the United States.

These plans come ahead of the CNN/Human Rights Campaign Foundation town hall, where Democratic presidential candidates will take questions from the audience and CNN journalists on specific LGBTQ concerns as well as their plans to promote equality and civility. The town hall will air Thursday from 7:30 p.m. to 12 a.m. ET.

The three candidates pledge to reverse the Trump administration's rollbacks of LGBTQ protections, including the ban on transgender military service members and religious exemption policies. Warren writes the US must end ""the weaponization of religion to discriminate against or harm LGBTQ+ people.""

Sen. Elizabeth Warren promised her nominee to the Department of Education would have to earn the approval of a nine-year-old child who claimed to be transgender.

The invited child, flanked by the mother, asked, “What are you doing … to make sure that kids like me feel safer in schools? And what do you think schools need to do better to make sure that I don’t have to worry about anything but my homework?”

Warren responded:

So let me start by saying, I want to have a secretary of education who both believes in public education and believes in the value of every one of our kids, and is willing to enforce our civil rights laws. It turns out that when the Department of Education was set up many years ago, the secretary of education was given a whole lot of power over the public schools, and over the rules and how they’re enforced. And we’ve had some secretaries of education who’ve been better. And we’ve had one that’s been a whole lot worse. Her name is Betsy DeVos. And when I’m President, she’ll be gone. And here’s my plan … I’m going to find just the right secretary of education. But here’s what I plan to do. I want to make sure that the person I think is the right secretary of education meets you and hears your story. And then I want you to tell me if you think that’s the right person, and then we’ll make the deal. Does that sound good?

“The Equality Act is essential,” said New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, referring to the House-passed Equality Act, which would establish the transgender ideology as law, and so outlaw and stigmatize any recognition of the complementary differences of women and men.

“If we can get five [Senate] votes, we will pass the Equality Act the next day,” said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. “We urgently need an Equality Act,” said Mayor Pete Buttigieg. “We would pass the Equality Act right off the bat, number one,” said Joe Biden.

The candidates promised to promote the status of gay and transgender people in K-12 schools, to roll back restrictions on blood donations, to appoint gay generals, and to subordinate national diplomacy to the goal of gay acceptance. “I would, in fact, curtail aid, curtail foreign assistance to countries who, in fact, engage in this kind of [anti-gay] behavior,” said Biden.

The audience picked by the pr0-transgender HRC was delighted with the river of promises and praise. “This means the world to all of us … I cannot believe this is happening,” said activist Julia Goldman, an author of a podcast about gay politics.

The Pentagon must treat male soldiers as if they are women once they say they are transgender, said Buttigieg. “The trans military ban is an outrage … That is dead wrong … I will put an end to that,” he said.

Religious rights must end when “religion is being used an excuse to harm other people,” Buttigieg said. Religious-based opposition to gay status “makes God smaller … It is an insult to faith to believe it can be used to hurt people in that way,” he said.

Religious groups must agree to arrange adoptions for gay couples, said Klobuchar. “You have got to have agencies that follow the law … You have got to [endorse] adoptions for gay families,” she said.

Warren jeered at critics of single-sex marriage and transgenderism. One questioner asked her:

Senator, thank you for being here. Now, let’s say you’re on the campaign trail, and a supporter approaches you and says, “Senator, I’m old-fashioned. And my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.” What is your response?” Well, I’m going to assume it’s a guy who said that. I’m going to say, just marry one woman. Assuming you can find one!

A moment later, Warren declared her deep belief in charity towards other people:

It’s about what I learned in the church I grew up, in first song I ever remember singing: “There is yellow, black and white, they are precious in His sight. Jesus loves all the children in the world.” … That was the basis of the faith that I grew up in. And it truly is about the preciousness of each and every life, it is about the worth of every human being.

Former California Attorney General, Kamala Harris, boasted of her refusal to defend California’s marriage law in 2008 from advocates for single-sex marriage.

Tom Steyer backed body-changing drugs for teenagers who say they are transgender. “All of that care should be available for all transgender youth,” he said. “It has to be part of the public [healthcare] option I believe in … It is an absolute right, and this is a critical part of healthcare for these young people.”

Warren promised taxpayer funding for cosmetic surgery for people who want to live as members of the opposite sex:

I believe that everyone is entitled to medical care and medical care that they need, and that includes people who are transgender, who — it is the time for them to have gender-affirming surgery. I just think that’s important and the appropriate medical care.

CNN’s announcers excluded any possible critics or skeptical questioners who might spotlight the political risks posed by the candidates’ unreserved support for transgender ideology. That ideology would change women’s status and rights, change education rules, and girls’ sports.

Amy Klobuchar provided the only moment of disagreement when she declined to endorse a call for legal prostitution. “I am not in favor of demineralizing all of sex work,” she said, but quickly backtracked, “but I’d love to talk with you for a few minutes and see if we can find common ground going forward.”

The only loud opposition came from several attendees who described themselves as black transgender women, including one named Blossom. A second person rebuked one CNN announcer for a mispronouncing the person’s name, saying, “it is violence to ‘misgender’ or to alter the name of a transperson.” A group interrupted the event to chant about “black trans” lives.

But Beto O’Rourke pushed the envelope.

“Discrimination” against people who are homosexual or transgender cannot be tolerated, he said. “There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone, any institution… that denies the human rights and full civil rights of every single one of us.”

He promised cheap anti-AIDS medicine: “We’ll bring down that cost … We will take over that patent and make sure it is distributed to every person in America.”

Mental-health professionals should not be allowed to guide adults or children who prefer to detransition from transgender status or to change homosexual feelings. “Conversion therapy … should be illegal,” O’Rourke said. “As president, I will seek to outlaw it everywhere in this country … this is tantamount to torture — a torture we visit on children who are absolutely defenseless,” he said.

Beto also promised a new policy to counter the murder of black transgender women, saying, “they will be the guide on this issue — they will direct our policy.” Countering the murders is “a matter of restoring the very fabric of America,” he said."

""I think it's absolutely critical for the United States of America to treat people in a humane and decent fashion.

Advocates tracked the deaths of at least 26 transgender people in the US in 2018, according to the Human Rights Campaign . In 2019, at least 19 transgender people have been fatally shot or killed, according to HRC.

The first demonstration occurred at the start of South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg 's town hall. Buttigieg said he shared the concerns of the protesters, who shouted, ""People are dying, do something!"" and ""Trans lives matter!"" before he could answer the first question.

""I do want to acknowledge what these demonstrators are speaking about, which is the epidemic of violence against black trans women,"" Buttigieg said, prompting applause from the crowd.

""And I believe or would like to believe that everybody here is committed to ending that epidemic, and that does include lifting up ... visibility and speaking to it,"" he continued.

As protesters chanted ""Trans lives matter!"" CNN's Anderson Cooper thanked the demonstrators and said there is a long history of protest in the LGBTQ community.

""Let me just point out, there is a long and proud tradition in history in the gay, lesbian and transgender community of protest and we applaud them for their protest,"" said Cooper, who was met by applause. AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), an activist group working to end the AIDS crisis, was particularly active in protesting for access to experimental medicine to treat the virus in the 1980's and 1990's, at the height of the AIDS epidemic.

Cooper continued: ""And they are absolutely right to be angry and upset at the lack of attention, particularly in the media, of the lives of transgender"" people.

After addressing the protesters, Buttigieg said he is ""very mindful of the fact that my experience as a gay man, but as a white cis-gendered gay man, means that there are dimensions for example of what it's like to be a black trans woman that I do not personally understand. But I also think the diversity within the LGBTQ-plus community is part of what we have to offer right now.""

Bamby Salcedo, a Latina transgender activist, was among the protesters on Thursday night. She spoke up during Buttigieg's time on stage, chanting along with others, ""Trans people are dying! Do something!""

Salcedo, who serves as the president and CEO of TransLatin@ Coalition, was invited to the forum as a special guest of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The Warren campaign did not immediately comment on Salcedo's protest.

Later during the town hall, when former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke was on stage, a protester named Blossom C. Brown emerged from the crowd and took the mic from a questioner.

""Black trans women are dying, our lives matter!"" Brown said into the mic. ""I am an extraordinary black trans woman, and I deserve to be here,"" she said, and the crowd clapped.

""I am tired. I am so tired ... It's not just my black trans women, it's my black trans brothers too. And I'm going to say what I'm going to say,"" Brown added.

CNN moderator Don Lemon asked for Brown's name, and asked her to come to the stage and hand him the mic. ""Blossom, let me tell you something. The reason that we're here is to validate people like you,"" Lemon said.

He returned the mic to Brown, who then pointed out the lack of representation of black transgender people throughout the night.

""Not one black trans woman has taken the mic tonight. Not one black trans man has taken the mic tonight,"" Brown said, referring to a lack of black transgender people asking questions by that point in the town hall. (Black transgender questioners appeared later in the program.)

Lemon said, ""We're proud and happy that you're here.""

O'Rourke thanked Brown in a tweet after the exchange for ""making your voice heard tonight,"" and wrote, ""We will hold a town hall focused on trans women of color. And I hope you'll be there.""

Buttigieg and O'Rourke were one of several 2020 candidates to appear at the town hall hosted by CNN and HRCF in Los Angeles, the day before the 31st anniversary of National Coming Out Day, answering questions on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer issues.

Senator Cory Booker, the night's first speaker, was politely laughed at for not answering a yes or no question about whether religious educational institutions that oppose LGBTQ rights should lose their tax-exempt status. Senator Elizabeth Warren had the zinger of the night when asked how she'd respond to an ""old-fashioned"" supporter who told her they believe marriage is between a man and a woman. Warren quipped : ""Then just marry one woman. I'm cool with that...assuming you can find one.""

And then there was former Vice President Joe Biden who suggested the vast majority of Americans are not homophobic but instead are afraid and don't know what to do or say. He finished his time mumbling something about bathhouses. It was as awkward as it sounds.

But the night did not belong to a single candidate but rather a single topic.

Several transgender women of color held small protests inside the town hall sporadically throughout the night in hopes of drawing attention to the string of underreported murders of similar women. According to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), which co-sponsored the event with CNN, more than 26 transgender people were murdered in 2018, most of whom were black transgender women.

So far this year HRC has reported that 19 transgender women have been killed . The lack of media coverage of these deaths is particularly jarring when juxtaposed against the frequent reminders that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots

Those protests, in response to police persecution 50 years ago, are seen as the birth of the modern gay rights movement. And while gays and lesbians, particularly those who happen to be white, have benefited from the steady progression toward cultural acceptance, the trans women who led those protests remain mostly in the shadows.

Perhaps this is why the demonstrations began just when South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg was about to speak. Buttigieg, an openly gay cisgender white male, has become a regular on Sunday morning talk shows and is a bit of a pop culture media darling. The discussion was being moderated by Anderson Cooper, another openly gay cisgender white male who, as a public figure, has seemed to find a high level of acceptance.

There is no question that coming out and living one's truth can be a difficult journey regardless of race or gender identity. But it is far too easy for people of a station and privilege in life—and for viewers who may pat themselves on the back for their broadmindedness -- to not acknowledge the struggles of the trans women of color who have not been as readily accepted despite their historical activism in the movement.

Buttigieg approached this as the protesters were removed: ""I do want to acknowledge what these demonstrators were speaking about, which is the epidemic of violence against black trans women in this country right now."" Ending that epidemic, he said, requires ""lifting up its visibility and speaking to it.""

To his credit, Cooper took a moment to applaud the protesters for their demonstration and acknowledge the lack of media coverage given to the trans community.

Cooper was right: If tens of cisgender gay white males were murdered in a year, it would undoubtedly garner much more media attention.

We should credit the candidates who were asked about their strategy to stop men from killing trans women of color (as one audience member yelled while Senator Kamala Harris was on stage) for at least being well versed on the issue. They spoke of the need to have a Department of Justice that seriously investigated these crimes. They spoke of the need to have an education secretary who was committed to protecting transgender students, something the current secretary has been reluctant to do. More importantly they looked these disenfranchised women in their eyes and they listened to their pain, something the community at large has not been particularly good at doing since the decline of AIDS.

Historically, because of family rejection and housing discrimination , many transgender people do not have the resources to attend a fabulous fundraiser with the promise of one-on-one time with a candidate. In fact, because of these civil rights violations, many must turn to sex work just to survive, a predicament that makes them vulnerable to the violence that has led to so many deaths.

They have been reliant on their gay and lesbian brothers and sisters with deep pockets to take their concerns up the socioeconomic ladder and quite honestly, they have been sorely let down.

Consumed with marriage equality, iconography, and heteronormativity, much of the past 50 years in the movement has been an exercise in white, cisgender, gay advancement despite its black and Latino transgender beginnings. Because of this, the policy improvements the candidates proposed on this historic night are somewhat secondary to the fundamental fight that still needs to be fought.

The long-standing running joke used to be that when it came to the LGBT movement, the T was silent. As uncomfortable as it was at times, on this historic night, that was not the case—and an important step."

But in the long term, it is a losing issue. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) made it so when she launched an “impeachment inquiry” without waiting for the evidence.

By the time Pelosi convened a fateful meeting with House Democrats on Sep. 24, Trump had already announced he would release the transcript the next day. Pelosi went ahead, anyway.

After years of claiming that Democrats would wait to see where the facts would lead, hoping that Special Counsel Robert Mueller would deliver the goods on Russia “collusion,” Pelosi decided that she could not wait 24 hours for the facts to emerge.

She had lost control: behind closed doors, she faced a caucus that already backed impeachment: a majority of House Democrats had majority it since August 1, a week after Mueller’s testimony produced a dud.

Regardless of her reasons, the decision was a serious political mistake. The rush to impeachment showed that Pelosi was willing to put politics ahead of facts — and ahead of all the other promises she had made to voters in 2018. The fact that she marched ahead of the evidence — which contradicted the whistleblower’s claims — gave Republicans a reason to rally behind the president. It will also put an asterisk next to the 2020 election, in the event Trump loses.

Pelosi repeated her error on Tuesday. The White House sent her an eight-page letter, citing the Constitution, the law, and judicial precedent, explaining why it would not cooperate with an “impeachment inquiry” that the House had not yet voted to authorize. Such a vote would trigger impeachment rules and procedures designed to ensure fairness.

Pelosi’s response failed to address the White House arguments, and accused Trump of trying “to hide the facts.”

The idea that the target of an investigation cannot insist on a fair procedure, and will be further implicated for trying to assert his or her rights — as Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) stated explicitly last week with Pelosi by his side — is reminiscent of “justice” in totalitarian dictatorships. It is, as Breitbart News noted last week, an echo of the horrors of the “Star Chamber,” which the Framers who wrote the U.S. Constitution’s Bill of Rights were eager to prevent.

Pelosi insists that the Constitution does not require the House to obey a set of rules or procedures for impeachment. She is right. But the Constitution also does not require the White House to comply with an “impeachment inquiry.” If the matter is brought to federal court, the judiciary would likely decline to intervene, citing the political question doctrine. Pelosi will have to hold an impeachment vote without the public ever seeing the evidence — or the defense.

There is another weakness in Pelosi’s approach. She is defending her “impeachment inquiry” based on the argument that she and her party are retraining a lawless president: “Mr. President, you are not above the law,” she declared on Tuesday.

But Pelosi herself is casting aside any set of rules. If the president’s alleged abuse of power is the problem, Pelosi and the Democrats are not providing an alternative. They are simply imposing their own arbitrary reign.

It is worth exploring President Trump’s alleged misconduct in further detail. He is accused of doing what Democrats have said for years that President Barack Obama’s administration had a duty to do: namely, to investigate possible foreign corruption by a presidential candidate. It was a matter of national security, they said, because Russia could use “kompromat” to control the president. (Many continue to claim Trump is doing Vladimir Putin’s bidding.)

The difference in the two cases is that Trump took personal responsibility for asking that Ukraine investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. Obama made a habit of avoiding any personal responsibility for anything controversial in his administration: he left that to underlings, then professed outrage when their misconduct was exposed. Trump not only made the request himself, but also repeated it publicly. He believes he has a duty to do so and is right to do so.

That is a matter for oversight, not impeachment.

It is telling that no one can name a single law that Trump has broken. After the so-called “whistleblower” raised his or her concerns, the Department of Justice (DOJ) investigated the president for allegedly violating campaign finance laws. It is illegal to accept foreign contributions, as two of Rudy Giuliani’s associates found out on Thursday. But the DOJ closed the case on Trump: he did not break the law.

As Democrats told us for years, while their party might have benefited politically from investigating the Trump campaign, that did not matter because there was a legitimate public interest in finding out whether Russian influence extended to a GOP candidate. (Never mind that Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee arguably broke campaign finance laws themselves by disguising payments to dig up dirt on Trump through foreign sources.)

Trump can cite a similar public interest in finding out what the Bidens were up to in Ukraine — all the more so because Joe Biden has admitted to quashing an investigation into a company on which his son, Hunter, was a board member.

Even if the Bidens did not actually do anything wrong, as the suddenly incurious media are rushing to tell us, there is no doubt that Joe Biden had a conflict of interest. The fact that he did not recuse himself was unethical.

But if what Trump did was in the public interest, what about the way he did it? Though there is no evidence of any quid pro quo — which would probably not be illegal anyway — the idea that Trump used a personal call to request that the new Ukrainian president examine both the 2016 election shenanigans and the Bidens’ activities strikes some observers as odd. It suggests that Trump has supposedly erased boundaries between the personal and the national.

Democrats interpret that as evidence of authoritarianism — as they have done with almost everything else Trump has done. If Trump lowers taxes that benefits American businesses as a whole, Democrats and their media allies rush to calculate how much the president’s own business interests might save as a result. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has campaigned for months on the idea that President Trump is benefiting personally from such alleged “corruption.”

Democrats and journalists showed considerable less interest in figuring out why President Obama made a sudden, albeit unsuccessful, pitch for Chicago to host the 2016 Olympics when he flew to Copenhagen in his first year as president. Hosting the Olympics often costs cities more than it is worth. But several of Obama’s Chicago friends — including, supposedly, White House adviser Valerie Jarrett — stood to benefit from an Olympic-sized windfall.

Trump does not operate that way. Indeed, the appeal for his voters was that unlike the Obamas, he had already made a fortune before going into politics (and risked a fortune by doing so). Rather than pursuing his personal interests as if they were the national interest, Trump has made the national interest his personal interest. As he said repeatedly in the 2016 race: “My whole life I’ve been greedy … Now I want to be greedy for the United States.” He is delivering.

His style bothers some constitutional conservatives, whose ideal would be a president who operates more at arm’s length. But Trump may be incapable of functioning any other way. Recall that he made his fortune as the head of a private, family business. He has never had to please shareholders — and may not have succeeded if he needed to do so. For him, personal success and company success are the same. He has brought that approach to the presidency.

That is why Trump often speaks off-the-cuff, even at ostensibly non-political or public events, about how his own performance is supposedly better than those of his predecessors. There is more than ordinary presidential narcissism at work (and Obama, unlike Trump, seemed unable to deliver even a prepared speech without using the first person pronoun incessantly). It is the way a family businessman thinks. It works — but it rubs some people the wrong way.

Democrats have an opportunity to provide an alternative to Trump by advocating a return to a more rules-based way of running the government. Instead, they are doing the opposite.

Pelosi has made it clear that she will not be bound by House precedent and will not follow the basic rules of fairness in the impeachment inquiry. Much of the inquiry thus far has been held behind doors in intelligence hearings, which allows Democrats to leak out-of-context details.

What Pelosi and the Democrats seem to be saying is that the normal rules and rights — which Republicans, even in their own impeachment frenzy, afforded to President Bill Clinton — must be suspended for this particular president. They argue no president is above the law. But no president is beneath it, either. And by protecting leakers like the so-called “whistleblower,” Democrats may even be condoning law-breaking for the “just” cause of ousting Trump.

That approach is not only legally and morally wrong: it is also politically disastrous. Before Pelosi ordered the impeachment inquiry, Trump was largely running against the “socialism” proposed by most Democrat presidential candidates. (In that vein, William Galston — the liberal on the Wall Street Journal op-ed page — warned Democrats this week that Warren, the new frontrunner, is too left-wing for voters in states Democrats must win in 2020.)

Now, Trump is running to defend democracy. Democrats, he argues, want to undo the last election and steal the next one. They cannot be bothered to wait for the voters to deliver their own verdict, mere months from now: they want to usurp the power of the people.

It is an argument for which Democrats have no answer. And if they manage to win in 2020 by using a partisan impeachment to tarnish the president, many Americans will lose faith in our democracy.

There are probably Democrats who think they are doing what is right for the country — just like there were FBI agents, starting with then-Director James Comey, who understood they were bending the rules in 2016 to help Hillary Clinton and hurt Donald Trump, but believed they were protecting the country. They acted as they did because they lacked faith in our constitutional checks and balances, and the wisdom of the American electorate.

Pelosi lacks that same faith — and the proof is that she refuses to authorize the impeachment inquiry with a vote. If she believed the case against Trump were strong, she would not oppose a fair process based on rules and precedent.

She told fellow Democrats that she was undertaking impeachment “prayerfully.” If so, there has never been a more faithless prayer. The Democrats are opposing democracy because they do not believe in it, or the American people.

(CNN) While polls suggest Joe Biden leads among black voters, please read the fine print. Although Barack Obama's vice president touts his African-American support by saying ""I think they know me,"" in reality that support is conditional, more specifically generational, and therefore flimsy and tenuous.

Biden enjoys widespread support among older black adults, leaving some younger black voters to try to convince their parents and grandparents to change their ways and shift their vote for the 2020 election.

Black millennials and Gen Z-ers are proactively attempting to sway their elder family members away from Biden and towards progressive candidates, as the New York Times reported in September. While it's unclear if the attempt to specifically sway older black voters is working, according to an October Quinnipiac poll , Biden's support among black registered Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters has dropped 17 points since their July poll.

Biden has downplayed this black generational gap, suggesting the votes of older and moderate blacks are all he may need to get him over the top. However, it should come as no surprise that Biden has a young black people problem.

While his age, 76, has been mentioned as an issue, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are also in his age group -- and yet their age, until Sanders' recent heart attack, has not emerged as a factor.

But what has proven a roadblock for Biden's support among young people of color is the shelf life of his mindset, his decades-old sentiments on race, society and politics that seem to lock him into the 1960s and 1970s. Add to that Biden's perceived persona of white moderation that tells black people we should move in baby steps rather than seek aggressive and immediate change.

During the third Democratic debate, when asked about slavery and reparations, Biden responded with references to black parents unable to raise their children, and by telling them to ""make sure you have the record player on at night."" At that moment, Biden sounded out of touch -- more like a white man blaming black people for their oppression.

While Obama sometimes lectured young black people, as he did during his 2013 commencement address to Morehouse College, he was able to get away with it because he was the black president, familiar with the hardships that black Americans face. And although Biden enjoys touting his proximity to Obama, it comes off as condescending when the former vice president addresses the black community about inequalities that plague it.

When Biden recently spoke at an LGBTQ presidential forum, he appeared out of touch with present-day criminal justice realities by insisting yet again that his 1994 crime bill did not increase mass incarceration.

""That act was overwhelmingly supported by the African-American community, overwhelmingly supported by the community at large. Everyone from Ted Kennedy on voted for it. It did not have mandatory life sentences in it. That wasn't what it was about,"" Biden argued.

Yes, the bill was supported by many black leaders at the time. And yes, studies have shown that incarceration rates were on a steady incline prior to the bill. But to repeatedly dismiss arguments that the bill had a role in increasing the mass incarceration rates, and how it continues to impact communities of color, is shortsighted.

For young black voters the denial of the crime bill's effects may bring to mind how it had a part in creating a flawed criminal justice system that allowed for the killers of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and Philando Castile to walk free while many people of color are serving lengthy prison sentences for doing far less.

A tone-deaf Biden once said that young people -- not specifically black -- who think these days are as hard as the 1960s have no right to complain.

""The younger generation now tells me how tough things are — give me a break,"" he told the Los Angeles Times last year. ""No, no, I have no empathy for it, give me a break.""

Perhaps Biden would have more credibility had he not been one of the most ardent supporters of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which makes it exceedingly difficult for people to discharge their student loan debt when they file for bankruptcy unless they can prove undue hardship.

America is suffering from a $1.65 trillion student-debt crisis amid soaring tuition rates. Blacks are hit particularly hard, with 85% of black college students holding debt compared to 69% of white students. Black people owe an average of $34,000, which is $4,000 more than their white counterparts.

And, according to the Brookings Institution , black students have three times the default rate. The racial wealth gap means black people have less accumulated wealth and borrow more than whites, and, as victims of institutional discrimination, are targeted by for-profit institutions.

A new generation of black voters does not need lectures on parenting skills or how to win the contest for black respectability. Young black adults are spending their time supporting their families and raising their children.

They are struggling against the impact of climate change that will hit their own communities hardest, while also fighting racial injustice and mass incarceration exacerbated by the 1994 crime bill Biden championed with pride. Not to mention, black voters are suffering from an historic loss of wealth since the Great Recession -- a subprime mortgage crisis from which homeowners, unlike Wall Street, never received a bailout.

But for young black voters watching the recent rise of white nationalism, Biden's history of being ""civil"" with segregationists (his word) is alarming.

As the 2020 election heats up, Biden may be feeling confident about securing the black vote, but it would be a mistake for him not to think about younger black voters, an influential part of this crucial voting bloc. For them, ""President Biden"" is not a solution to the social, economic and environmental issues that they face."

Schweizer elaborated on his Wednesday-published New York Times opinion editorial in a same-day interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host and Washington Post columnist Henry Olsen.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-KY) financial relationship with the Chinese state is illustrative of the status quo of foreign business relationships between politicians and foreign governments evading disclosure requirements, explained Schweizer.

The family of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who is McConnell’s wife, owns a seafaring shipping business, noted Schweizer. “They had it even before Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao were married, but in 1993 … the Chinese government basically struck a deal with the Chao family, where they said, ‘We will finance the construction of your cargo ships. We will provide crews for your cargo ships, and state-owned enterprises in China will give you lots of contracts to ship our goods around Asia.'”

Schweizer continued, “And what you’ve seen as that relationship has budded, is basically that Mitch McConnell has become a lot less critical of the Chinese government, and this is essentially what the Chinese are playing at. They’ve done it in Australia. They’ve done it in New Zealand [and] other parts of Asia. They are quite confident that the way to deal with adversarial countries or countries that are resistant to their policies is essentially [is to] try to buy off the political class, and they’ve had some success in doing that, and they’re doing that in the United States today.”

LISTEN:

Schweizer noted how Joe Biden’s geopolitical analysis of China changed following his youngest son, Hunter Biden, launching a private equity firm with $1.5 billion in financing from the Chinese state.

“Joe Biden was basically a hawk on China for most of his Senate career in the ’80s and ’90s, even up until the early parts of the Obama administration,” Schweizer remarked. “Joe Biden has basically said, ‘We should welcome a rising China. China is not a threat. There is benefit to China becoming stronger, because they will be more like us.'”

“China is going to eat our lunch? C’mon man,” said Biden in May, further dismissing China as a geopolitical threat, “They’re not a competition for us.”

Olsen contrasted news media focus on alleged foreign-rooted conflicts of interest between President Donald Trump and those of Joe Biden via Hunter Biden’s business dealings in China and Ukraine.

“The thing that gets me is that Hunter Biden is obviously a troubled individual,” Olsen stated. “The New Yorker magazine profile of him goes into enormous detail about his troubles. For three years, we’ve been hearing about every little thing about the Trump children or the Trump administration, and how awful it is that foreign dignitaries stay at the Trump Hotel in DC because they might be currying favor with the president, and how terrible it is that Chinese investors are buying condos in Jared Kushner’s family’s buildings, and yet here we’ve got this troubled person, who Joe Biden obviously loves, who is raking in cash well beyond his expertise, and supposedly we’re not supposed to be worried about it. The double standard here is just glaring.”

Olsen added, “It’s almost like you can imagine some sort of shakedown deal. You can almost imagine somebody going up to [Joe Biden] and saying, ‘Nice son you’ve got there. Shame if something were to happen to him.’ It’s very troubling. You don’t even have to say that [Joe Biden] has changed his mind [on China.] The fact is Hunter Biden’s future is now indebted to people and regimes that are potentially hostile to the United States, and definitely regimes that we want to have an interest in, and he, unfortunately, has a personal stake [in this] because of his son’s involvement. That’s news, and it’s as much news as when the president of Ukraine says, ‘Oh, I stayed in the Trump Tower when I was in New York.’ In fact, I’d say it’s even more so.”

Asked by Mansour for solutions to combating foreign procurement of political influence through business relationships with politicians’ family members, Schweizer proposed legislation modeled after the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

“Here’s the paradox,” replied Schweizer, “A few years ago … one of [J.P. Morgan’s] subsidiaries was fined hundreds of millions of dollars by the federal government of the United States because what their subsidiary did was hire the children of Communist Party officials in China with the explicit hope of getting favorable treatment from the Chinese government. So they paid a large fine for that, and that violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which means you are not allowed to provide a favor or a benefit to a foreign government officials in exchange for favorable treatment.”

Schweizer continued, “Here’s the problem. It’s called the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for a reason. It does not apply in the United States. If J.P. Morgan did what they did in China and got fined for — if they did the same thing in the United States — it would be completely legal and acceptable. And to me, that should be unacceptable. The notion that American corporations are not allowed to buy foreign politicians — but foreign corporations can buy American politicians — I don’t think is where we want to be as a country. I’m proposing [a] legislative solution that creates similar barriers to hiring the family members of politicians in the United States.”

Without identifying specific persons, Schweizer revealed that he had discussed the aforementioned legislative proposal with some senators.

“I recognize it’s not going to be easy to get passed,” said Schweizer of the Washington Corrupt Practices Act. “You’ve people on both sides of the aisle that want to cash in, but I think this is key, or we’re going to continue to see in this country a descent into more corruption, into kind of a third-world swamp where the political class is getting rich and their interests are not aligned with the populace; their interests are aligned with foreign oligarchs or companies that are paying them.”

“At a very minimum … there ought to be a disclosure,” Schweizer continued. “If Joe Biden or Mitch McConnell are running for office, they’re required to disclose a $200 donation from anybody. It’s required by federal law, and the reason is we want to know who’s putting money in their campaign coffers if that person is getting favorable treatment or influence. And they’re also required to disclose if they have $1000 in stock in General Electric, because we want to make sure their decisions are not being marred by their own financial interests. So they have to disclose those things. But their adult child, like Hunter Biden, joins a Chinese firm — a billion-dollar firm funded by the Chinese government — there’s no disclosure requirement.”

Existing disclosure requirements related to campaign contributions and investment are insufficient to reveal potential conflicts of interest between politicians and foreign states, noted Schweizer. “I would argue that if you are a foreign entity, the best way to get influence over an American politician is not by making a $200 campaign contribution, it’s not by hoping they own $1000 of your stock, it’s by striking a lucrative deal with one of their kids, and yet there’s no disclosure requirement. At a minimum, we should require American politicians [and] elected officials in senior government positions [to disclose] if their immediate family members have deals with foreign governments. They should be required to disclose that and let citizens know that.”

The Washington Corrupt Practices Act may yield bipartisan support, speculated Schweizer.

“This has the prospect of a kind of populist left-right legislative approach,” Schweizer estimated. “Imagine if you could have a Ted Cruz, [a] conservative Republican, and an [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], who is really a left-wing socialist in Congress, both of them [support this]. This is the sort of issue I think resonates with them and their view of Washington. They’re suspicious of the establishment. They see this as corrupt and I’m hoping that we can find common cause.”

Schweizer added, “That’s what happened with the STOCK Act. You had conservative Republicans in the Freedom Caucus [and] left-wing Democrats in New York who all said, ‘It’s outrageous. They shouldn’t be trading stock in this way. We need to place some restrictions on it.’ I think this has the same marker. The biggest challenge you’re going to have is with leadership. Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell, they’ve been there for a long time. They like to set aside these kinds of perks for themselves. They don’t like to place restrictions on fellow members of Congress. I think you have reform-minded people in both parties, and I just think they need to have the courage to step up and say, ‘You know what? We need to have a legislative solution to this,’ and I think it’s going to be very hard for the leadership to resist a move, because these are not issues where you’re going to find even five percent of the American people who think this is a good idea. Most Democrats and most Republicans think this is terrible and needs to stop.”

Olsen concluded, “Sounds to me like the one thing Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and President Trump could all agree on.”

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) advocated for mixed-sex prisons as part of the “LGBTQ+ Rights and Equality” plan she released on Thursday, hours before the Human Rights Campaign’s town hall on CNN.

Warren detailed her proposal in a Medium post, painting a bleak picture of the state of LGBT rights under the Trump administration. She accused the Trump White House of weaponizing the “language of religion” and giving entities a “license to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people.”

While Warren’s proposal contains a swath of promises of protections for LGBT individuals, the presidential hopeful specifically vowed to mix federal prisons, allowing men to move into women’s prisons on the basis of “gender identity” rather than biological sex. She said she would instruct the Bureau of Prisons to house transgender inmates according to their identified sex, much like the Obama administration did in January 2017.

Warren’s plan states:

I will direct the Bureau of Prisons to end the Trump Administration’s dangerous policy of imprisoning transgender people in facilities based on their sex assigned at birth and ensure that all facilities meet the needs of transgender people, including by providing medically necessary care, like transition-related surgeries, while incarcerated.

Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a reversal of the Obama administration’s mixed-sex policy in 2018, determining that it would resume using “biological sex as the initial determination.”

As Breitbart News reported:

Critics said Obama’s transgender policy would have created huge risks of rape because few people who say they are transgender have undergone genital cosmetic surgery, and few can pass as members of the opposite sex. For example, Obama’s policy would allow male criminals into women’s prisons and pressure women-who-say-they-are-men to live in men’s prisons. Sessions’ new policy marks another step in reasserting the normal biology-based legal distinctions between female and male. Those distinctions were being scrubbed from the law by Obama’s pro-transgender policies. Trump has already begun reversing Obama’s pro-transgender policies in K-12 schools, in health care, and the military which now says it classifies soldiers’ sex by using the “bright line based on biological sex.”

Warren previewed her position in the criminal justice reform plan unveiled in August, which specifically called for “special protections” for LGBT individuals behind bars.

This is hardly the first time Warren has courted the transgender community. She applauded a child who claimed to be transgender during CNN’s Equality Town Hall on Thursday evening.

“I want to make sure that the person I think is the right secretary of education meets you and hears your story, and then I want you to tell me if you think that’s the right person and then we’ll make the deal,” Warren said.

Warren also vowed to provide taxpayer-funded sex-reassignment surgery. She outlined that position in her comprehensive LGBT agenda, calling for “gender-affirming” health care.

“I believe that everyone is entitled to medical care and medical care that they need, and that includes people who are transgender, who — it is the time for them to have gender-affirming surgery,” Warren said during the town hall.

“I just think that’s important and the appropriate medical care,” she added.

Warren, however, has not always felt that way. She said in 2012 that she did not find sexual reassignment surgery – for a transgender inmate, specifically – a “good use of taxpayer dollars.”

“I have to say, I don’t think it’s a good use of taxpayer dollars,” she said at the time, only to reverse her position years later."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), on Wednesday, arguing that the country is “not electing a planner.”

While the top-tier candidates in the Democrat primary field have largely refrained from taking deep digs at one another, Biden signaled that he may switch strategies.

“We’re not electing a planner,” Biden said in New Hampshire on Wednesday, in an apparent reference to Warren. “I’ve been there. I know what it takes to get it done.”

Warren has made “I have a plan for that” a catchphrase of her campaign, claiming to have solutions for virtually every major problem the country faces and outlining those broad plans in a series of Medium posts over the course of her campaign. Most of Warren’s plans contain a common thread, incorporating aspects from additional proposals within her political arsenal.

Warren has unveiled a $3 trillion climate change proposal inspired by former presidential candidate and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), a plan focused entirely on “honoring and empowering tribal nations and Indigenous peoples,” and a proposal to “end corruption in Washington.”

In August, Warren released her comprehensive criminal justice reform plan, which emphasized protections for “special populations” — such as LGBT individuals — and called for the elimination of private prisons.

In September, Warren added to her ultra-progressive agenda, promising to raise Social Security benefits by $200 per month. She said she would pay for it by taxing the “wealthy” — specifically, by increasing the Social Security contribution requirement to 14.8 percent for individuals making $250,000 per year, and splitting the 14.8 percent “equally between employees and employers at 7.4 percent each.”

Most recently, Warren released a plan to address “environmental injustice” and “environmental racism” across the country.

Biden’s jab comes after weeks of a slow, steady surge in Warren’s favor, besting Biden in a variety of recent polls and overtaking him in the RealClearPolitics average for the first time this week.

A poll from The Economist/YouGov showed Warren topping the field with 29 percent to Biden’s 25 percent — a lead which remains outside of the +/- 2.9 percent margin of error:

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) for her “authenticity.”

VERDICT: False. Doubts about Warren’s latest tale were first raised by a female socialist.

Thomas Kaplan writes in the New York Times that Republicans and conservatives have questioned Warren’s claim that she was fired from a teaching job in 1971 because she was “visibly pregnant.” In doing so, Kaplan writes, they have “employed a tactic — questioning a female candidate’s authenticity — that is at once often a sexist trope in politics and a strategy used against Hillary Clinton in 2016.”

The article appears as “news analysis,” not opinion.

Unfortunately, for Kaplan, there are three problems. The first is that doubts about Warren’s pregnancy tale were first raised by left-wing Jacobin magazine wrier Meagan Day, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.

All over the internet you can find people calling Elizabeth Warren a “former public school teacher” and saying it was her “first career.” Warren was a public school teacher for one year. She immediately left the classroom, went to law school, and became a law professor. Come on https://t.co/2zeSS5OkeM — Meagan Day (@meaganmday) October 1, 2019

That’s not what she says in this interview: https://t.co/5rXCR5UXha pic.twitter.com/bynQBLjNcd — Meagan Day (@meaganmday) October 1, 2019

Second, Warren has made a habit of telling false stories. For years, she falsely claimed Native American ancestry — and fundraised off (correct) efforts by critics to debunk her story, just as she is doing now with her pregnancy story.

More recently, her campaign has consistently exaggerated crowd sizes at her events, and Warren has repeatedly evaded questions — even from well-meaning liberals — about whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for her “Medicare for All” plan. Warren’s “authenticity” is in doubt because she keeps putting it in doubt.

Third, questioning a candidate’s honesty is the bread-and-butter of politics. Journalists and opponents always challenge what candidates say. To claim that the normal course of politics is a “sexist trope” is absurd. It is also an effort — arguably, a sexist one — to shield a female candidate from scrutiny, as if she could not win on the merits.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has been in contact with radical leftist and failed gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum (D), sparking rumors that the presidential hopeful is considering him as a potential running mate.

Warren has been in contact with Gillum — the radical leftist who lost Florida’s gubernatorial race to Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) last fall — according to the Daily Beast:

And for several candidates, including at least one in the top tier, former Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum is on speed dial. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), in particular, has been in contact with Gillum over the past several months, multiple knowledgeable sources told The Daily Beast.

While the Warren campaign says that the vice presidential rumors are “baseless and not at all true,” sources who spoke to the Daily Beast said that their relationship is reminiscent of the search process a candidate typically goes through in order to find the right running mate:

One source briefed on the communications said the two Democrats have been in contact over the course of the campaign and that there is a “strong impression” that Gillum is a possible vice presidential contender for Warren, who has risen in recent months to become a frontrunner in the 2020 primary, the source said. “If you’re trying to win Florida, I would be courting Andrew and that’s what’s happening,” a second source familiar with the conversations said.

Gillum rose to the national spotlight after challenging DeSantis in Florida’s close gubernatorial race last year, earning the support of celebrities like pop sensation Rihanna and rap star Sean “Diddy” Combs. Despite a strong backing from Hollywood, Gillum lost. DeSantis narrowly squeaked out a win in the Sunshine State, besting Gillum by less than half a percentage point, or less than 325,000 votes.

Gillum largely campaigned on many of the far-left’s go-to narratives, such as Medicare for All, gun control, and increased taxation — three issues that particularly resonate with Warren.

As Breitbart News reported in July, Gillum is utilizing his private non-profit in an effort to register 1 million voters and ultimately flip Florida blue. His use of the private non-proft is of interest, as Gillum previously decried the use of “dark money” in politics. By using his private non-profit for such an effort, he can “can disclose much less financial data, including the sources of donations”:

Gillum’s use of the nonprofit, calling itself Forward Florida Action, is notable given the Florida politician’s warning last February about the influence of “dark money” in his own race for governor, referring to entities that obscure their donors. Gillum is deploying his nonprofit for the voter registration drive instead of utilizing his political committee, Forward Florida. … The change came after the Tampa Bay Timesreported in May that the FBI had subpoenaed records related to his 2018 gubernatorial campaign. This after Gillum’s time as Tallahassee mayor was tied to an FBI probe into city hall corruption, a federal investigation that involved undercover FBI agents going on trips with Gillum.

Like Warren, Gillum has called for Trump’s impeachment and has remained a voice for the far-left flank of the Democrat Party.

Gillum subtly addressed the reports of his conversations with Warren in a tweet on Thursday.

“Many of my friends running to beat @realDonaldTrump call me often — about one thing: how to win Florida,” he wrote, plugging his voter registration drive:"

Before closing, Warren indicated that she would like to have Jacob vet who she chooses as the secretary of education in her administration.

“I want to make sure that the person I think is the right secretary of education meets you and hears your story, and then I want you to tell me if you think that’s the right person and then we’ll make the deal,” Warren said.

Jacob smiled and gave Warren a thumbs up as he took his seat.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said she was wrong about a previous statement she made during her 2012 campaign for U.S. Senate calling gender-reassignment surgery for inmates not a “good use of taxpayer dollars.”

In her revised view, Warren called the operation “important and appropriate” when posed the question by CNN host Chris Cuomo.

Partial transcript as follows:

CUOMO: Senator, quick follow. Speak to your evolution on this. In the 2012 campaign for Senate, you criticized a judge’s ruling that granted transition-related surgery to a transgender inmate. You said, “I don’t think it’s a good use of taxpayer dollars.”

WARREN: Right.

CUOMO: Do you regret that?

WARREN: Yep. No, it was a bad answer. And I think it was a bad answer. And I believe that everyone is entitled to medical care and medical care that they need, and that includes people who are transgender, who — it is the time for them to have gender-affirming surgery. I just think that’s important and the appropriate medical care.

CUOMO: So if you help people get to where they want to be, you also have to protect them as what they are. Do you think that a crime against somebody who is transgender should be charged as a hate crime in statute?

WARREN: You know, I think we could if we think that’s going to be the most effective way to make change. So I’m certainly — I’m open to this. But I’ll tell you what I really want. I want a Justice Department that takes this seriously. I want to create a Justice Department that says these crimes matter.

And when they’re not federal crimes, when they are state crimes, in the same way that our Justice Department is empowered to step in if a state is failing to enforce laws and as a result it’s leaving women unprotected, it’s leaving people of color unprotected, the same should happen for LGBTQ people. We need a Justice Department that is on the side of the people, all of the people."

Deadline reported that former Vice President Biden will attend two Hollywood fundraisers on Thursday — one in the afternoon hosted by former HBO executive Michael Lombardo, and one in the evening at the home of Paramount Pictures chairman and CEO Jim Gianopulos.

CNN’s town hall, titled Equality in America, is set to air Thursday evening, from 7:30 p.m. to 12 a.m. ET, and will feature nine Democratic presidential candidates. The event is co-organized by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, a non-profit focused on LGBTQ issues.

The town hall comes amidst increased U.S.-China tensions — a subject that hits close to home in the entertainment industry, which depends heavily on Chinese consumers to buy movie tickets and visit theme parks.

Hollywood executives have remained conspicuously quiet about U.S.-China relations in the wake of democracy protests in Hong Kong that have put global businesses including the NBA to Apple in a difficult spot.

President Donald Trump has publicly hammered Biden over his close ties with China, accusing the former Vice President and his son, Hunter, of being “paid off” by foreign interests.

Moderators of Thursday’s town hall include CNN’s Dana Bash, Anderson Cooper, Chris Cuomo, Don Lemon and Nia-Malika Henderson.

Sen. Harris (D-CA) reportedly attended a reception at The Abbey in West Hollywood on Wednesday, while Buttigieg is set to attend a fundraiser at the Belasco Theater in downtown L.A.

Deadline reported earlier this week that Buttigieg attended a separate L.A. fundraiser on Tuesday at the home of former CAA agent Michael Kives, who is now head of the investment advisory firm K5 Global.

Celebrities who were reportedly in attendance include Leonardo DiCaprio, Glenn Close, Ashton Kutcher and Paris Hilton.

Hollywood is a reliable fundraising pitstop for Democratic candidates.

Hillary Clinton made numerous L.A. visits in her failed 2016 bid for the White House, including events with mega donor and billionaire Haim Saban, the founder of Saban Entertainment.

CNN’s town hall is set to take place at the Novo, at the L.A. Live complex in downtown L.A.

Other Democratic presidential hopefuls scheduled to appear include Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Beto O’Rourke, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, Tom Steyer and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ).

In June, the majority of 2020 Democrats running for president — including Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — endorsed a plan that would force American taxpayers to provide free health care to all 11 to 22 million illegal aliens in the U.S. and anyone else who crosses the southern border.

The latest study by Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) researchers reveals that providing health care to all illegal aliens would cost American taxpayers up to $23 billion a year should every illegal alien enroll. This total includes at least 2.5 million low-income illegal aliens and their children who would cost almost $13 billion a year, alone, to be given health care.

Even if only about five million illegal aliens enroll in federal subsidies for health care, American taxpayers would be forced to foot a $10.4 billion bill every year, CIS researchers conclude. Overall, providing taxpayer-funded health care to each illegal alien costs Americans about $4,600 a year.

With a scenario in which higher-income illegal aliens are enrolled in Obamacare and poorer illegal aliens take Medicaid, that plan would still cost Americans nearly $20 billion a year assuming every illegal alien enrolls. Based on current enrollment trends, a lower enrollment rate among illegal aliens would nonetheless cost Americans $10.7 billion a year.

Previously, Breitbart News estimated, based on CIS analysis, that providing illegal aliens with taxpayer-funded health care would cost Americans about $66 billion every year and $660 billion every decade. This assumed that every illegal alien enrolled and each cost $3,000 to insure.

While 2020 Democrats have made giving health care to illegal aliens — paid for by U.S. taxpayers — a priority, experts have said that such a policy would drive “strong incentives for people with serious health problems to enter the country or remain longer than their visas allow in order to get government-funded care.”

The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds that the 2020 Democrats’ health care for illegal aliens plan is the most unpopular policy position thus far in the race for president with opposition from 62 percent of all likely voters.

Today, Americans are forced to subsidize about $18.5 billion of yearly medical costs for illegal aliens living in the U.S., according to estimates by Chris Conover, formerly of the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research at Duke University.

The failed presidential candidate, who has become increasingly vocal and visible in recent weeks, publicly lamented on Twitter it is proving to be a, “challenge to keep up with the high crimes and misdemeanors” supposedly committed by the president:

It's becoming a challenge to keep up with the high crimes and misdemeanors. — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 10, 2019

Clinton, who lost to Trump handily in 2016, did not specify what she considers those “high crimes and misdemeanors” to be. The comment comes a day after she declared impeachment the “only appropriate remedy” to address the president’s “unconstitutional abuse of power, his contempt of Congress, and his obstruction of justice.”

Clinton told a Washington, DC, crowd during a stop on her Gutsy Women tour that “foreign governments think they can tilt the playing field” as they did against her and claimed that Republicans are generally OK with it:

If foreign governments think they can tilt the playing field as they did against me, which was a deliberate, well planned out effort laid out in an indictments against Russian military actors and their allies– Well, you know, Republicans seem to think that, ‘Ok, so far Russia’s playing on the red team. You know. So we like it. We’re not going to stand up against it.’ Well, who’s to say that next week they’re going to be playing on the blue team? It’s crazy my friends.

She added that impeaching Trump is the “appropriate remedy” to the blatant “assault on our democracy.”

“I am all in favor of what the House is doing and gathering the evidence and making the case because this president has to be held to account because of his unconstitutional abuse of power, his contempt of Congress, and his obstruction of justice,” Clinton said.

Her increased appearances and remarks have been driving speculation that former Democrat nominee is considering another presidential bid.

Trump on Tuesday suggested that “Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren” on the condition of explaining her “high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting ‘C’ Subpoena!”

Clinton replied, “Don’t tempt me. Do your job,” further fueling the rumors:

The remark came after Buttigieg, who is the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, was asked about whether bullying that causes suicide should have legal ramifications.

“I believe it’s one of the things that could help,” Buttigieg said. “There are still states — I live in one of them — that don’t have hate crime legislation.”

“And we need to make sure that our legislation reflects our values as a country and the insistence that nobody be singled out or harmed because of who they are,” Buttigieg said.

He continued:

But that’s just the beginning of what we’ve got to do for LGBTQ youth. We know that LGBTQ youth are much more likely to experience homelessness, which is one of the reasons why we need to invest more in youth homelessness in general and do the opposite of what this president is doing, which is allowing rules to go forward that would actually make it harder for transgender youth to access homeless services.

“That is just wrong, and it will end in my administration,” Buttigieg said.

In fact, while the HUD rule — posted in spring 2019 — does allow for shelters to make decisions based on privacy and safety, it specifically states that discrimination based on “sexual orientation and gender identity” will not take place:

This proposed rule provides that grant recipients, subrecipients, owners, operators, managers, and providers (Shelter Providers) under HUD programs which permit single-sex or sex-segregated facilities (such as bathrooms or temporary, emergency shelters and other buildings and facilities with physical limitations or configurations that require and are permitted to have shared sleeping quarters or bathing facilities) may establish a policy, consistent with state and local law, by which such Shelter Provider considers an individual’s sex for the purposes of determining accommodation within such shelters and for purposes of determining sex for admission to any facility or portion thereof. The proposed rule permits Shelter Providers to consider a range of factors in making such determinations, including privacy, safety, practical concerns, religious beliefs, any relevant considerations under civil rights and nondiscrimination authorities , the individual’s sex as reflected in official government documents, as well as the gender which a person identifies with. The proposed rule does not dictate a required basis for making determinations other than that they be consistent with an overall policy. The proposed rule continues HUD’s policy of ensuring that its programs are open to all eligible individuals and families regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.

Buttigieg joined eight other Democrat candidates at the marathon town hall, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), as well as former HUD Secretary Julian Castro (D), former Vice President Joe Biden (D), former Rep.

Lucy McBath’s (D-GA) office in Sandy Springs, Georgia, over her support of pursuing an impeachment inquiry against President Trump.

McBath, who serves on the House Judiciary Committee, voted in favor of the impeachment inquiry last month. Protesters gathered outside of her office on Wednesday to demonstrate support for the president, chanting “four more years” and holding up Trump 2020 signs. One sign spotted at the protest read, “Impeach Pelosi.”

“She’s had an agenda from day one to bring [Trump] down,” resident Jill Wright said of McBath, according to AJC.

“The Democrats need to work for their constituents and not have an agenda,” she continued. “They are disrespecting our president and they are also setting a poor example for our children.”

McBath is in a vulnerable district, barely edging out former Rep. Karen Handel (R-GA) in 2018. McBath won by one percent, or 3,264 votes.

Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District tilted in Hillary Clinton’s favor in the 2016 election by 1.5 percent, although Trump ultimately won the state. However, as internal polling suggests, Democrats in key congressional districts face an uphill battle, as the majority of constituents do not consider Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky an impeachable offense, and that conversation largely serves as the basis for the partisan-fueled impeachment inquiry.

“Pro-Trump patriots showed up to @RepLucyMcBath‘s office in #GA06 this week to protest her support of Pelosi’s impeachment witch-hunt,” Donald Trump Jr. wrote.

“Sorry #LiberalLucy, you can’t vote for Pelosi for Speaker, support her impeachment witch-hunt and still call yourself a ‘moderate,'” he added. “#VoteHerOut”:

J&J was not immediately available for comment about whether it planned to appeal the judgment.

What's more, health care stocks may not catch on as a defensive play, either. Conservative investors have more attractive options among sectors that pay bigger dividends.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), a former chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, announced her endorsement of the former vice president on Tuesday, claiming to have witnessed Biden’s “fortitude” and leadership during their overlapping tenures in Congress.

Feinstein said in a statement:

I’ve worked closely with Vice President Biden and I’ve seen firsthand his legislative ability, his statesmanship, and most importantly his moral fortitud. During his time in Congress and in the White House, Joe Biden has been a tireless fighter for hard working American families.

The endorsement comes as Biden’s presidential campaign is besieged by scandal regarding the lucrative business dealings his youngest son, Hunter, had with foreign governments.

Only hours before Feinstein’s endorsement, the Chinese government announced it would not investigate how Hunter Biden ended up at the center of one its top private equity firms. The Chinese foreign ministry made the decision after President Donald Trump publicly called for a probe of Hunter Biden’s dealings with Bohai Harvest RST (BHR). In particular, Trump has noted that the circumstances surrounding BHR’s creation could have posed a conflict of interest for Joe Biden.

As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, revealed in his bestselling book Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden inked the multibillion-dollar deal that created BHR with a subsidiary of the state-owned Bank of China in 2013.

The timing of the lucrative deal has been brought into question as it came only 12 days after Hunter visited China with his father aboard Air Force Two. Officially, the then-vice president was visiting the country amid escalating tensions over islands in the South China Sea and decided to bring his granddaughter and son along. In a March 2018 interview with Breitbart News Tonight, however, Schweizer detailed the political machinations that preceded Hunter Biden’s $1.5 billion venture with China:

In December of 2013, Vice President Joe Biden flies to Asia for a trip, and the centerpiece for that trip is a visit to Beijing, China. To put this into context, in 2013, the Chinese have just exerted air rights over the South Pacific, the South China Sea. They basically have said, ‘If you want to fly in this area, you have to get Chinese approval. We are claiming sovereignty over this territory.’ Highly controversial in Japan, in the Philippines, and in other countries. Joe Biden is supposed to be going there to confront the Chinese. Well, he gets widely criticized on that trip for going soft on China. For basically not challenging them, and Japan and other countries are quite upset about this.

Since its creation, BHR has invested heavily in energy and defense projects across the globe. As of June, Hunter Biden was still involved with BHR, sitting on its board of directors and owning a minority stake of the fund estimated to be worth more than $430,000.

Such dealings at the center of politics and business, while perhaps not illegal, are not exclusive to the Biden family alone. As a few noted at the time of Feinstein’s endorsement, the senator and her husband have their own close ties to the communist country.

During her tenure as mayor of San Francisco in the late-1970s and early-1980s, Feinstein took advantage of the newly normalized diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China by establishing one of the first sister city partnership between San Francisco and Shanghai. Through that partnership, Feinstein led trade delegations to China in which she and her husband, Richard Blum, became acquainted with some of the country’s most prominent political leaders.

As the Federalist noted in August 2018, Feinstein and her husband leveraged those relationships to boost their own wealth. In 1986, Feinstein and Jiang Zemin — the then-mayor of Shanghai, who would later ascend to the presidency of the People’s Republic of China — “designated several corporate entities for fostering commercial relations.” One of those firms was Shanghai Pacific Partners, which employed Blum as a director. Blum reportedly had an interest of upwards of $500,000 in a project backed by Shanghai Pacific Partners.

After Feinstein was elected to the Senate in 1992, Blum continued profiting off their ties to China. A the same time, the freshman lawmaker was pitching herself as a “China hand” to colleagues, even once claiming “that in my last life maybe I was Chinese.” Through her seat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Feinstein led the fight on a number of initiatives seen as being favorable to China, including granting the country permanent most-favored-nation trading status in 2000.

Despite Feinstein and her husband having a close relationship with Jiang, the Chinese government targeted the senator as part of its espionage operations. In the early 2000s, the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) recruited a longtime employee of the senator to gather information about the inner workings of her congressional and district offices. Feinstein only learned of the staffer’s duplicity in 2013, after he’d already been on her payroll for more than 20 years.

“While this person, who was a liaison to the local Chinese community, was fired, charges were never filed against him,” Politico reported in 2018, speculating that because “the staffer was providing political intelligence and not classified information—making prosecution far more difficult.”

Apart from the convoluted history of the senator’s ties to China, the political timing of Feinstein’s endorsement also caught many off guard. The California Democrat, who hosted a fundraiser on Biden’s behalf last week alongside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) daughter, is only the most recent figure from the Democrat establishment to openly pledge support for the former vice president. Feinstein’s endorsement, however, was not totally expected, especially since her seamate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), is mounting a bid of her own for the Democrat nomination. In fact, earlier this year, Feinsten flirted with the notion of remaining neutral in the 2020 contest out of respect for Harris.

Compounding the political picture is that most polls show Biden no longer the favorite to win California, having fallen behind Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

Feinstein, however, did not address any of that when endorsing the former vice president on Tuesday. Instead, the senator offered platitudes about Biden’s work to enhance gun control and how his campaign was a “fight to restore the soul of the nation.”"

By exploiting a leaker’s hearsay to turn an innocuous phone call my father made to his Ukrainian counterpart into grist for the impeachment mill, the Democrats and their allies made their objective transparent: They want the 2020 presidential election to be strictly about this phony controversy.

They certainly don’t want to contest this administration’s record in next year’s election, and they definitely don’t want to test my father’s popularity with the American people. They’d much prefer to leave the outcome of the 2020 election in the hands of the Beltway establishment and the elite-approved media. This Ukraine “scandal” is merely a vehicle to allow them to do the latter and avoid the former.

Let me be clear: There was nothing illegal, improper, or even remotely impeachable about my father’s phone call with President Zelensky.

Hunter Biden, on the other hand, took a $600,000-a-year job with a notoriously corrupt foreign company despite being woefully unqualified. This was almost certainly due entirely to his father’s perceived influence as the Vice President of the United States at the time — the same influence the elder Biden used, by his own admission, to pressure Ukraine into firing the prosecutor investigating his son’s firm.

That needs to be investigated, as does the equally suspicious circumstances surrounding Hunter’s trip to China with his father while Hunter was in the midst of negotiations for $1.5 billion in Chinese cash. Fortunately, Senator Lindsey Graham has pledged to invite Rudy Giuliani to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, so we’ll soon know a lot more about those shady dealings.

Whatever role Ukrainian nationals and firms operating in Ukraine may have played in laying the groundwork for what became the Russiagate hoax also must be investigated. My father has said this, publicly. Attorney General Bill Barr has said this, publicly. His subordinates at the Justice Department have said this, publicly.

Why on Earth would anyone be surprised that my father would ask foreign leaders with the ability to assist those investigations to do so? Considering that the same Democrats who are now clamoring for impeachment themselves asked the Ukrainians to assist in investigating my father, how can any of them claim with a straight face that my father acted improperly, let alone call for his impeachment?

As Sen. Graham’s hearings will no doubt reveal, corruption has been endemic in Ukraine for many years. It would have been downright irresponsible for the President of the United States to ignore that issue before handing over hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars.

In short, none of them actually believe this nonsense. The Democrats are simply hoping to tarnish my father’s political standing before the voters have to start evaluating the choice between Donald Trump and whichever far-left radical the Democrats nominate to run against him.

Indeed, the left’s hysterical reactions to Ukrainegate are just recitations of the same attacks they’ve been making since before my father was even elected.

Deranged lawyer George Conway just wrote a rambling, 11,000+ word opinion article pretending to be a psychologist judging my father as mentally unfit for office. J.W. Verret, who briefly served on my father’s transition team, is convinced that Ukrainegate is worse than Watergate — “a lot worse,” in fact.

Liberal journalist Paul Brandus goes even further. Not only is my father “much worse than Richard Nixon,” Brandus contends that he’s actually a traitor to America!

Doesn’t this sound familiar? It should.

Worse than Watergate? Anyone making that claim this week is obviously slow on the draw. Watergate one-hit wonder Carl Bernstein was using the “worse than Watergate” line back in November 2017. One of the men who wound up in prison as a result of Bernstein’s reporting, John Dean, was convinced that my father had breached the “worse than Watergate” wall in May 2017, just four months after taking the oath of office.

George Conway thinks my father is unfit for his office? The same USA Today editorial board that published Brandus’s “treason” claim broke decades of policy to say the exact same thing … in September 2016, before my father was even elected.

Speaking of treason, NBC News was accusing my father of treason in July 2016 — before he was even the Republican nominee — over a joke. It only took another year for the Democrats to accuse me of the same thing without a shred of truth.

Yet, they expect you to believe their latest hysterics about a phone call with Ukraine. It’s a joke, and not a very funny one, at that. Even the people making the claims reveal so much with their own behavior. J.W. Verret — a professor whom the media is presenting as a former Trump supporter won over by the evidence of wrongdoing in Ukrainegate — was calling for impeachment months ago, when this Ukraine “whistleblower” scheme wasn’t even a twinkle in Adam Schiff’s eye.

Schiff, the Jussie Smollet of American politics, is trying to make this about Ukraine. As I hope you can see, it just doesn’t wash. This impeachment farce is solely about preventing a repeat of the greatest political embarrassment in the modern history of the Democratic Party: my father’s victory in 2016.

The prospect that the Democrats will be able to unseat my father in a fair election are fading fast. Hunter Biden’s scandals, along with a series of embarrassing gaffes and apparent “senior moments” on the debate stage have crippled the Democrats’ putative front-runner, Joe Biden. The corresponding ascendance of Senator Elizabeth Warren makes it increasingly likely that the Democrats will nominate a candidate from the Party’s far-left wing, which is woefully out of step with the American mainstream.

Democrats evidently feel that the 2020 presidential election cannot be left to chance. They don’t want to give the American people the option of making the same “mistake” twice. Nothing else adequately explains this impeachment push.

Michael Anton famously wrote at the time that 2016 was the “Flight 93” election — the final chance for Americans to regain control over the airplane of state before it fell forever into the hands of Hillary Clinton and her vast network of swamp creatures, who would create conditions under which the people would never be able to choose their own destiny again.

Three years ago, Americans rose to the occasion. They chose the future they wanted, and, since January 2017, my father has worked tirelessly to deliver it to them. The would-be impeachers on Capitol Hill are desperately trying, as they have throughout, to take that choice back and ensure that the American people are never given such an opportunity for autonomy again.

They are trying to use the Ukraine hoax to override the will of the people, and they aren’t even being subtle about it.

Speaking to residents of the Villages in Ocala, Florida, Trump said while Democrats are seeking to expand Medicare so that “all” Americans can be on government-run socialized medicine, he intends to protect it, keep it for seniors only, and improve it by providing more options within the Medicare Advantage program and reducing its costs.

“Together, we’re creating a healthcare system that protects vulnerable patients, makes healthcare more affordable, gives you more choice and control, and delivers the high-quality care Americans deserve,” Trump told seniors in Florida. “And that’s what we’re doing — we’re strengthening our healthcare system to a level that nobody thought would be possible.”

Though the president’s executive order does not change any current policy by itself, it will launch necessary regulatory proposals by federal agencies, particularly the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Here are five ways Trump’s executive order seeks to strengthen Medicare:

Brings Medicare up to date and provides more plan choices:

Within a year, Trump would like to see the HHS secretary propose a regulation that enables Medicare “to provide beneficiaries with more diverse and affordable plan choices.”

The president wants to “encourage innovative … benefit structures and plan designs” in Medicare Advantage, the program that allows millions of older Americans to access various private health insurers at lower cost due to Medicare subsidies.

In his order, Trump says he wants to “reduce barriers to obtaining Medicare Medical Savings Accounts” and to “promote innovations in supplemental benefits and telehealth services.”

Healthcare analyst Christopher Jacobs, CEO of Juniper Research Group, explained at the Federalist that Medicare Medical Savings Accounts are “a health savings account-like mechanism that gives beneficiaries incentives to serve as smart consumers of health care.”

“To accomplish that last objective, the order references broader access to cost and quality data, ‘improving [seniors’] ability to make decisions about their health care that work best for them,’” Jacobs noted.

Younger Americans are gradually becoming more aware of the costs of healthcare services and prescription drugs. Many are using apps that help them assess the cost of a service or drug by various providers and pharmacies. Trump’s order reflects that the practice of deciding what is best for each individual patient does not end when an American turns 65. When more Americans of any age seek the best quality health care at the lowest price, the costs of those services will come down.

Encourages “enhanced access” to health care:

The implementation of Trump’s executive order would allow more older Americans to access to health care services through telemedicine and other technologies.

Jacobs noted this feature could especially be helpful to seniors in rural areas.

Very importantly, the order also seeks to take on states whose restrictions curtail competition in healthcare access and, thus, lead to limited provider networks in Medicare Advantage plans.

Seeks elimination of regulatory burdens for providers:

The executive order demands further improvement of Medicare by “eliminating burdensome regulatory billing requirements, conditions of participation, and other requirements that serve as obstacles to more providers participating in the program, including physician assistants and nurse practitioners.

In a press statement, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) commended Trump for taking “bold steps toward increasing the ability of American seniors to choose the medical care and insurance options best for them, instead of being trapped within increasingly insolvent government-run programs.”

“AAPS thanks President Trump for the options he is granting seniors, and the physicians who care for them, in Section 11 of the Executive Order aimed at curbing the further encroachment of socialized medicine in the United States,” said AAPS Executive Director Jane M. Orient, M.D.

Allows Medicare patients to directly receive monetary savings for using healthcare services that provide the best care at the least cost:

Trump’s order wants older Americans to reap the benefits of learning about costs in healthcare services by directly providing them with rebates and allowing them to share in the savings of the updated program.

Ends the Clinton-era rule that required older Americans who wished to opt out of government-run Medicare Part A to forfeit their Social Security benefits:

The president’s executive order finally demands a change in the 1993 rule that required Medicare and Social Security to be linked together. The Clinton administration wrote the rule that states seniors cannot opt out of Medicare without giving up their Social Security benefits, even though they had been forced to pay into Social Security for years.

The order states:

Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary, in coordination with the Commissioner of Social Security, shall revise current rules or policies to preserve the Social Security retirement insurance benefits of seniors who choose not to receive benefits under Medicare Part A, and propose other administrative improvements to Medicare enrollment processes for beneficiaries.

“It is unethical, not to mention contrary to basic common sense, to insist that American seniors only receive care through Medicare,” said Orient.

AAPS added:

Medicare’s Hospital Trust Fund will be depleted by 2026 and over the next 10-15 years, counting the Trust Funds as assets rather than taxpayer liabilities, the Medicare program is only 71% funded under trustees’ unfavorable assumptions, and 91% under favorable assumptions. Giving seniors the ability to escape this faltering program will help ease the looming crisis as well as give American’s access to options that work best for them, not government bureaucrats.

The Clinton-era rule was challenged by a nonprofit group seeking healthcare freedom, but, in 2011, a federal judge ruled in favor of the Obama administration and stated “requiring a mechanism for plaintiffs and others in their situation to ‘dis-enroll’ would be contrary to congressional intent, which was to provide ‘mandatory’ benefits under Medicare Part A and for those receiving Social Security Retirement benefits.”

“Plaintiffs are trapped in a government program intended for their benefit,” U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer continued. “They disagree and wish to escape. The Court can find no loophole or requirement that the Secretary provide such a pathway.”

Under Trump’s order, individuals would still be required to pay Medicare taxes, but if they chose private health insurance, they could opt out of the government-run program without forfeiting their Social Security benefits.

Jacobs observed the proposal “stands as a common-sense solution to our entitlement shortfalls.”

“After all, why should we force someone like Bill Gates or Warren Buffett to accept Medicare benefits if they are perfectly content to use other forms of health coverage?” he reasoned.

Orient emphasized the need to increase patient freedom, rather than adopt “Medicare for All,” which will eliminate choice.

“Widening escape hatches from an insolvent program and other looming Medicare changes, that will deteriorate patient care and limit their options, is needed now more than ever,” she said."

Morgan Cox, chair of the Human Rights Campaign Board of Directors, asked the Massachusetts senator how she would respond if an ""old-fashioned"" supporter told her that they believe marriage is between one man and one woman.

""I'm going to assume it is a guy who said that,"" Warren started. ""And I'm going to say, 'Well, then just marry one woman. I'm cool with that.'""

She then paused and shrugged before finishing her joke -- ""Assuming you can find one"" -- with a deadpan delivery that sent the crowd into loud applause.

Warren later reflected on how faith influences many people's beliefs towards the LGBTQ community, including her own, and recited the first song she remembers learning as a child in Oklahoma.

320,"Paul R. La Monica, CNN Business",,"Some business leaders, inlcuding Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, have expressed reservations about Elizabeth Warren. But others argue that even if she goes on to win the presidency, that won't be a problem for Wall Street or the economy.",2019-10-11,CNN,What would an Elizabeth Warren presidency mean for the economy and markets? - CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/11/investing/elizabeth-warren-stock-market-economy/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) The possibility that Elizabeth Warren could win the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination — and perhaps even defeat Donald Trump — is starting to unnerve some in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street.

But would a President Warren actually be a bad thing for big business and the stock market?

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees this summer that a Warren White House would not be good for the social media networking company, because of her calls to break upand other big tech companies.

Tech news site The Verge reported earlier this month that, according to leaked audio clips, Zuckerberg said ""if [Warren] gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah.""

And a recent survey by RBC Capital Markets showed that investors are nervous about Joe Biden's poll numbers and Warren's ascent.

""Investors clearly think Biden is better for the stock market than Warren,"" said Lori Calvasina, head of US equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, in the report. In fact, Warren was viewed as ""the least market friendly"" candidate, Calvasina noted.

Warren has a populist platform and has talked about doing more to regulate the financial, tech, health care and energy industries. She has also proposed a wealth tax of 2% annually on households with a net worth above $50 million and 3% on households with a net worth higher than $1 billion.

So it's understandable why Wall Street has concerns about Warren.

The reasons why Warren wouldn't tank the stock market

Still, some experts think that worries about Warren are way overdone.

For one, few believe that the Senate will flip to Democratic control in 2020 — even if President Trump loses his reelection bid.

So there are limits to how much a President Warren could do with executive orders if Congress is split, said Matt Daly, a managing director and head of corporate credit research at Conning.

And a Warren win could boost some parts of the market and economy, Daly told CNN Business. He pointed to clean energy and infrastructure as sectors that likely would benefit if Warren were to win the race for the White House.

Even though Mark Zuckerberg may not be a fan of the Massachusetts senator, other leaders in the tech industry support Warren's candidacy.

Big Tech starting to warm to Warren

According to a Vox/Recode story earlier this month, numerous tech insiders said they liked Warren because of her rigorous approach to coming up with policy ideas. Many also viewed her as a more palatable alternative to Bernie Sanders, who is also on the far-left, progressive side of the Democratic party.

Alphabet GOOGL Amazon AMZN Apple AAPL Microsoft MSFT AT&T T Disney DIS IBM IBM To that end, employees and PACs tied to Google ownerandare listed by the Center for Responsive Politics' OpenSecrets.org site as among the biggest donors to Warren's campaign. CNN ownerandwere also among the top 20 contributors.

Analysts at tech, media and telecom research firm MoffettNathanson don't seem worried about Warren either, noting that there's a difference between campaign rhetoric and actual policy.

""We're relatively sanguine. Sure, a Warren presidency would heighten regulatory risks. But a Warren presidency would heighten regulatory risks for lots of industries,"" the MoffettNathanson analysts said in a report. The analysts added that ""her platform has more planks than a pirate ship; she's got plans for everything.""

JUST WATCHED Warren: This is what fossil fuel wants us talking about Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Warren: This is what fossil fuel wants us talking about 02:25

Warren has also talked tough about China. That actually could be good for the markets, despite current concerns about the trade war.

Even though Trump's tactic of imposing more tariffs on China has hurt American companies and consumers — including from China's retaliatory measures — there is support in the business community for Washington to enforce intellectual property rights more forcefully with Beijing.

Warren would probably continue that approach. So it may not be in China's best interests to drag out trade talks and hope that it will no longer have to deal with Trump in 2021 if Warren continues to gain ground in the polls.

""There is growing consensus that China may hold out, trying to 'run out the clock' on the Trump administration through next November. These dynamics are changing, however, as Elizabeth Warren emerges and Joe Biden fades,"" said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide, in a report this week.

""Warren is running on populist policies and could be as challenging an adversary to the Chinese than Trump,"" Hackett added.

Continued pressure on China in a Warren White House?

A likely strong approach to dealing with China is a key reason why Kyle Bass, founder of the Hayman Capital Management hedge fund, said he is backing Warren too.

Bass told CNN Business in August that he would ""immediately"" vote for Warren because of her stance on China. She has criticized the country's environmental and labor/human rights policies and has also accused China of currency manipulation.

It's also worth noting that Wall Street was initially wary of Barack Obama in 2008 because of similar fears about the prospects for tougher regulations on the health care and financial sectors. (Of course, Wall Street was scared about lots of things unrelated to politics in 2008, such as the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the Great Recession.)

But the Obama presidency wound up being far more friendly to businesses than many had expected. So the same thing could happen if Warren wins the White House."
321,"Analysis by Harry Enten, CNN",,First things first: The theme song of the week is the closing credits to Timon & Pumbaa.,2019-10-12,CNN,"Why it's Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and then everybody else",https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/12/politics/joe-biden-elizabeth-warren-polls/index.html,"A new Fox News poll of Democratic primary voters nationwide finds that 32% want former Vice President Joe Biden to be the Democratic presidential nominee in 2020. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren comes in at 22%. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders stands at 17%. No one else polls better than 5%.

An average of polls taken since the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump began have Biden at 29%, Warren at 25%, Sanders at 15% and no one else above 5%.

What's the point: Right now, there's little doubt that Biden and Warren are the top tier in the Democratic primary fight. With the exception of Sanders, no one is even close to Biden and Warren nationally. The question now is how likely are we to be looking at the potential nominee when focusing on the top three at this point.

A look back at history suggests there is a high likelihood that either Biden, Sanders or Warren will be the Democratic nominee.

There have been 16 primaries in the modern era in which an incumbent was not running in said primary. For those 16, I looked at the polling averages for each candidate who ultimately ran or was running in the second half of the year before the primary. These averages were calculated by FiveThirtyEight

There have been a number of candidates not close to leading in the polls at this point who went on to win the nomination. A trailing candidate has gone on to win 7 of 16 times (44%). You may recall Barack Obama was trailing Hillary Clinton at this point in the 2008 Democratic primary. Of course, Obama was running second to Clinton.

When you look outside the top three polling candidates in past primaries, there really hasn't been a lot of success. Only three times has a candidate not in the top three at this point won a nomination. Those were George McGovern in 1972, Jimmy Carter in 1976 and John Kerry in 2004.

Another way to look at this is to look at the percentage everyone was polling at. When the leader in the national polls in the second half of the year before the primary was at greater than 20% (12 times), there has been just one instance of someone polling below 15% going on to win the nomination: McGovern in 1972. And even he was polling at 6%, which is greater than all the Democrats outside of the top three at this point in the 2020 cycle.

We can formalize this analysis through a simple model looking at where candidates were polling and whether they won the nomination. When one candidate is polling at about 30% and another is polling at about 25% in contests with no incumbent running, together they have about 75% chance of winning the nomination. Add in a candidate polling at about 15%, the chance that one of the top three wins is about 85%.

Indeed, the average of our three statistical exercises suggest there's about an 85% chance Biden, Warren or Sanders wins the nomination.

This means that the national polls indicate the chance that someone not named Biden, Sanders or Warren wins the nomination is about 15%.

Now, 15% isn't nothing. It leaves open the possibility that one of the candidates at 5% or below may end up strongly challenging for the nomination. The fact that there are so many of them this year perhaps heightens the chance of a non-top three polling candidate wins this year. Perhaps, it will be someone like South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is polling very close to the top three in Iowa

Still, the most likely outcome is that the Democratic nominee will be Biden, Sanders or Warren, with Biden and Warren having particularly strong chances."
322,"Brian Fung, CNN","(CNN)A fresh series of Facebook ads this week by Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren seeks to put the social media giant on the defensive by telling a lie.

Elizabeth Warren seeks to put the social media giant on the defensive — by telling a lie.,2019-10-11,CNN,Elizabeth Warren targets Facebook's ad policy -- with a Facebook ad,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/11/politics/elizabeth-warren-facebook-ad/index.html,"(CNN) A fresh series of Facebook ads this week by Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren seeks to put the social media giant on the defensive — by telling a lie.

The ads, which began running widely on Thursday, start with a bold but obvious falsehood: That Facebook and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg have endorsed President Trump's reelection campaign.

""You're probably shocked,"" reads the ad, which has already reached tens of thousands of viewers nationwide. ""And you might be thinking, 'how could this possibly be true?' Well, it's not.""

The ad's own admission of a lie seeks to draw attention to a controversial Facebook policy Warren has spent days criticizing. Under the policy, Facebook exempts ads by politicians from third-party fact-checking — a loophole, Warren says, that allows Zuckerberg to continue taking ""gobs of money"" from Trump's campaign despite Trump's ads telling untruths about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.

On Saturday, Warren explained her ad was meant ""to see just how far"" the policy goes.

""We intentionally made a Facebook ad with false claims and submitted it to Facebook's ad platform to see if it'd be approved,"" she tweeted. ""It got approved quickly.""

Facebook's willingness to run the ad, she said, shows how the company prioritizes profits over protecting democracy.

Warren's escalating criticism of Zuckerberg highlights the backlash Facebook has faced as it has defended its policy on political advertising. Sen. Amy Klobuchar , another Democratic candidate, tweeted on Thursday that online platforms like Facebook need a ""truth standard for paid ads."" And Biden's campaign has compared Trump's ads to Russian-backed disinformation.

""Whether it originates from the Kremlin or Trump Tower, these lies and conspiracy theories threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections in America,"" Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo said on Tuesday.

In a statement Friday responding to Warren's ad, Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone said the company believes political speech should be protected.

""If Senator Warren wants to say things she knows to be untrue, we believe Facebook should not be in the position of censoring that speech,"" Stone said.

Facebook's policy on truthfulness in political ads has been in place for over a year, according to Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communications. In a recent speech, Clegg said Facebook demotes third-party content shared by politicians on its platform if it has been previously debunked by fact-checkers and rejects its inclusion in advertisements. That could include links, photos or videos created by others. But it does not cover misleading ads or other content created under politicians' own names.

The Warren ad puts Facebook in a challenging position, said Dave Karpf, an associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University.

""Either Facebook doesn't touch the ad and the ad is therefore noteworthy, or they touch the ad and it's noteworthy,"" he said. ""It's a smart tactical move.""

Warren has become one of Facebook's key antagonists after first calling for it and other Silicon Valley giants — such as Amazon, Google and Apple — to be broken up. But her rift with Facebook deepened after leaked audio published by The Verge revealed Zuckerberg fretting about the potential consequences of a Warren presidency.

""If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,"" Zuckerberg is heard saying at a companywide meeting. ""And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. ... But look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.""

Warren responded via Twitter, ""What would really 'suck' is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.

And earlier this week, she said Facebook ""already helped elect Donald Trump once. Now, they're deliberately allowing a candidate to intentionally lie to the American people.""

Other analysts say Facebook has made the right decision not to involve itself in regulating political speech. Lee Goodman, a former Republican chairman of the Federal Elections Commission, told CNBC Thursday that he believed Facebook's policy is ""fair"" because it ""doesn't want to be the arbiter and doesn't want to take sides in these political debates.""

Shannon McGregor, an assistant professor of communication at the University of Utah who has studied the impact of tech platforms on political speech, agreed that Facebook's policy provides greater transparency about its role in political discourse.

But she added that Facebook's efforts to remain neutral — particularly now, with respect to Warren — could itself affect the course of the 2020 campaign.

""The limits of what our political discourse is these days is, of course, largely shaped by these platforms where a lot of these politics happen,"" she said."

Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.",2019-10-11,CNN,Teamsters kick off endorsement process as 2020 Democrats race for labor support,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/11/politics/teamsters-endorsement-process-2020/index.html,"(CNN) As the Democratic primary candidates aggressively campaign for labor support, the Teamsters on Friday rolled out the details of their newly expanded endorsement process, including recently taped interviews with Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren .

The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents 1.4 million workers, is among the largest in the country. Over the last month or so, nearly a dozen candidates have sat down on-camera to make their cases to union voters. Nine hopefuls, including former Vice President Joe Biden, have signed a pledge promising their support on issues Teamsters members recently voted to prioritize ahead of the primary.

""I think the candidates are trying to resonate and talk about what issues are important to working people more than what they did last time (in 2016),"" Teamsters General President James P. Hoffa said in an interview. ""And I think they're doing a good job.""

Hillary Clinton finished nine percentage points ahead of President Donald Trump (51% to 42%) with union households in 2016. Democrats will hope that margin widens come 2020. Warren, Biden and Sanders have all actively sought labor support and appeared on picket lines with striking United Automobile Workers members. Sanders in particular has made labor a focal point of his campaign, and been a fixture alongside workers protesting for higher wages and a union.

To be eligible for the Teamsters' official backing, candidates -- including Trump -- must agree to a three-point pledge assuring their support for labor-friendly trade deals, federal efforts to enhance and protect collective bargaining rights, and legislative action to protect endangered pension funding. Union members can track the process on a new website launched late Thursday. The candidates are also being asked to promise official neutrality should their staffs, as a number have already done, move to unionize.

The Teamsters also announced plans to hold a candidate forum on December 7 in Iowa.

When the union chose Clinton over Trump in 2016, the announcement came in late August. Hoffa didn't specify when a choice would be made this time around, suggesting it might not come until, or after, the Democratic National Convention next summer in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The process, which is meant to more deeply engage candidates and rank-and-file union members, will culminate with Hoffa delivering a recommendation -- based in part on a survey of local leaders -- to the general executive board.

Hoffa pointed to the fluid nature of the crowded race, and the increased attention on labor issues, as reasons the Teamsters might take their time in picking a horse. So far, most major unions have been slower to jump behind a single candidate.

""This is changing so fast. You know, who would have imagined that Bernie would have a heart attack, who would imagined the controversy with regard to Biden and his son,"" Hoffa said. ""Those are unknown things. And there's always unknown things that happen in campaigns, especially when you have a long time like this.""

There are, however, already a number of clear divides among the candidates publicly vying for Teamster support. Most notable is their backing -- or opposition -- to ""Medicare for All"" single-payer health care, the signature proposal of Sanders' campaign. A number of labor leaders and some vocal union members have expressed concern over a move to Medicare for All.

Hoffa is among the skeptics.

""The Teamsters have health care for all. And I just think we have to educate (the candidates) on that issue. I can't believe they would say that we're going to give up our insurance,"" he said. ""That's something we would be very, very strong on. That's just not something that we would concede.""

Still, he spoke warmly of his and the union's relationship with all of the leading candidates -- and the efforts of union members to engage them on the trail. According to the union, Teamsters have made more than 100 contacts with candidates over the last three months, asking them 95 questions. Twenty Teamsters locals in 14 states, with a focus on the early-voting hubs, have taken active roles. Midwestern swing states like Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania will also see a burst of door-knocking, phone calls, text messaging and other digital outreach.

""I'm very heartened because I happen to know all these candidates. One way or another, over the years, we got to talk -- when Biden was vice president, Warren in the Senate. Bernie we've known for years and (New Jersey Sen. Cory) Booker we've known forever,"" Hoffa said. ""And all these people come together with a lot of experience and it's a very talented group of people."""

Sen. Elizabeth Warren promised her nominee to the Department of Education would have to earn the approval of a nine-year-old child who claimed to be transgender.

The invited child, flanked by the mother, asked, “What are you doing … to make sure that kids like me feel safer in schools? And what do you think schools need to do better to make sure that I don’t have to worry about anything but my homework?”

Warren responded:

So let me start by saying, I want to have a secretary of education who both believes in public education and believes in the value of every one of our kids, and is willing to enforce our civil rights laws. It turns out that when the Department of Education was set up many years ago, the secretary of education was given a whole lot of power over the public schools, and over the rules and how they’re enforced. And we’ve had some secretaries of education who’ve been better. And we’ve had one that’s been a whole lot worse. Her name is Betsy DeVos. And when I’m President, she’ll be gone. And here’s my plan … I’m going to find just the right secretary of education. But here’s what I plan to do. I want to make sure that the person I think is the right secretary of education meets you and hears your story. And then I want you to tell me if you think that’s the right person, and then we’ll make the deal. Does that sound good?

“The Equality Act is essential,” said New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, referring to the House-passed Equality Act, which would establish the transgender ideology as law, and so outlaw and stigmatize any recognition of the complementary differences of women and men.

“If we can get five [Senate] votes, we will pass the Equality Act the next day,” said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. “We urgently need an Equality Act,” said Mayor Pete Buttigieg. “We would pass the Equality Act right off the bat, number one,” said Joe Biden.

The candidates promised to promote the status of gay and transgender people in K-12 schools, to roll back restrictions on blood donations, to appoint gay generals, and to subordinate national diplomacy to the goal of gay acceptance. “I would, in fact, curtail aid, curtail foreign assistance to countries who, in fact, engage in this kind of [anti-gay] behavior,” said Biden.

The audience picked by the pr0-transgender HRC was delighted with the river of promises and praise. “This means the world to all of us … I cannot believe this is happening,” said activist Julia Goldman, an author of a podcast about gay politics.

The Pentagon must treat male soldiers as if they are women once they say they are transgender, said Buttigieg. “The trans military ban is an outrage … That is dead wrong … I will put an end to that,” he said.

Religious rights must end when “religion is being used an excuse to harm other people,” Buttigieg said. Religious-based opposition to gay status “makes God smaller … It is an insult to faith to believe it can be used to hurt people in that way,” he said.

Religious groups must agree to arrange adoptions for gay couples, said Klobuchar. “You have got to have agencies that follow the law … You have got to [endorse] adoptions for gay families,” she said.

Conservatives & (some) feminists agree biology shapes our personalities & politics. They're uniting to stop the progressives' ruthless ""transgender"" demand that we deny biology's impact on people & politics despite the known hazards to adults, teens & kids https://t.co/gND8VfyMOl — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 9, 2019

Warren jeered at critics of single-sex marriage and transgenderism. One questioner asked her:

Senator, thank you for being here. Now, let’s say you’re on the campaign trail, and a supporter approaches you and says, “Senator, I’m old-fashioned. And my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.” What is your response?” Well, I’m going to assume it’s a guy who said that. I’m going to say, just marry one woman. Assuming you can find one!

A moment later, Warren declared her deep belief in charity towards other people:

It’s about what I learned in the church I grew up, in first song I ever remember singing: “There is yellow, black and white, they are precious in His sight. Jesus loves all the children in the world.” … That was the basis of the faith that I grew up in. And it truly is about the preciousness of each and every life, it is about the worth of every human being.

Former California Attorney General, Kamala Harris, boasted of her refusal to defend California’s marriage law in 2008 from advocates for single-sex marriage.

Tom Steyer backed body-changing drugs for teenagers who say they are transgender. “All of that care should be available for all transgender youth,” he said. “It has to be part of the public [healthcare] option I believe in … It is an absolute right, and this is a critical part of healthcare for these young people.”

Warren promised taxpayer funding for cosmetic surgery for people who want to live as members of the opposite sex:

I believe that everyone is entitled to medical care and medical care that they need, and that includes people who are transgender, who — it is the time for them to have gender-affirming surgery. I just think that’s important and the appropriate medical care.

CNN’s announcers excluded any possible critics or skeptical questioners who might spotlight the political risks posed by the candidates’ unreserved support for transgender ideology. That ideology would change women’s status and rights, change education rules, and girls’ sports.

Amy Klobuchar provided the only moment of disagreement when she declined to endorse a call for legal prostitution. “I am not in favor of demineralizing all of sex work,” she said, but quickly backtracked, “but I’d love to talk with you for a few minutes and see if we can find common ground going forward.”

The only loud opposition came from several attendees who described themselves as black transgender women, including one named Blossom. A second person rebuked one CNN announcer for a mispronouncing the person’s name, saying, “it is violence to ‘misgender’ or to alter the name of a transperson.” A group interrupted the event to chant about “black trans” lives.

But Beto O’Rourke pushed the envelope.

“Discrimination” against people who are homosexual or transgender cannot be tolerated, he said. “There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone, any institution… that denies the human rights and full civil rights of every single one of us.”

He promised cheap anti-AIDS medicine: “We’ll bring down that cost … We will take over that patent and make sure it is distributed to every person in America.”

Mental-health professionals should not be allowed to guide adults or children who prefer to detransition from transgender status or to change homosexual feelings. “Conversion therapy … should be illegal,” O’Rourke said. “As president, I will seek to outlaw it everywhere in this country … this is tantamount to torture — a torture we visit on children who are absolutely defenseless,” he said.

Beto also promised a new policy to counter the murder of black transgender women, saying, “they will be the guide on this issue — they will direct our policy.” Countering the murders is “a matter of restoring the very fabric of America,” he said."

Advocates tracked the deaths of at least 26 transgender people in the US in 2018, according to the Human Rights Campaign . In 2019, at least 19 transgender people have been fatally shot or killed, according to HRC.

The first demonstration occurred at the start of South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg 's town hall. Buttigieg said he shared the concerns of the protesters, who shouted, ""People are dying, do something!"" and ""Trans lives matter!"" before he could answer the first question.

""I do want to acknowledge what these demonstrators are speaking about, which is the epidemic of violence against black trans women,"" Buttigieg said, prompting applause from the crowd.

""And I believe or would like to believe that everybody here is committed to ending that epidemic, and that does include lifting up ... visibility and speaking to it,"" he continued.

As protesters chanted ""Trans lives matter!"" CNN's Anderson Cooper thanked the demonstrators and said there is a long history of protest in the LGBTQ community.

""Let me just point out, there is a long and proud tradition in history in the gay, lesbian and transgender community of protest and we applaud them for their protest,"" said Cooper, who was met by applause. AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), an activist group working to end the AIDS crisis, was particularly active in protesting for access to experimental medicine to treat the virus in the 1980's and 1990's, at the height of the AIDS epidemic.

Cooper continued: ""And they are absolutely right to be angry and upset at the lack of attention, particularly in the media, of the lives of transgender"" people.

After addressing the protesters, Buttigieg said he is ""very mindful of the fact that my experience as a gay man, but as a white cis-gendered gay man, means that there are dimensions for example of what it's like to be a black trans woman that I do not personally understand. But I also think the diversity within the LGBTQ-plus community is part of what we have to offer right now.""

Bamby Salcedo, a Latina transgender activist, was among the protesters on Thursday night. She spoke up during Buttigieg's time on stage, chanting along with others, ""Trans people are dying! Do something!""

Salcedo, who serves as the president and CEO of TransLatin@ Coalition, was invited to the forum as a special guest of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The Warren campaign did not immediately comment on Salcedo's protest.

Later during the town hall, when former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke was on stage, a protester named Blossom C. Brown emerged from the crowd and took the mic from a questioner.

""Black trans women are dying, our lives matter!"" Brown said into the mic. ""I am an extraordinary black trans woman, and I deserve to be here,"" she said, and the crowd clapped.

""I am tired. I am so tired ... It's not just my black trans women, it's my black trans brothers too. And I'm going to say what I'm going to say,"" Brown added.

CNN moderator Don Lemon asked for Brown's name, and asked her to come to the stage and hand him the mic. ""Blossom, let me tell you something. The reason that we're here is to validate people like you,"" Lemon said.

He returned the mic to Brown, who then pointed out the lack of representation of black transgender people throughout the night.

""Not one black trans woman has taken the mic tonight. Not one black trans man has taken the mic tonight,"" Brown said, referring to a lack of black transgender people asking questions by that point in the town hall. (Black transgender questioners appeared later in the program.)

Lemon said, ""We're proud and happy that you're here.""

O'Rourke thanked Brown in a tweet after the exchange for ""making your voice heard tonight,"" and wrote, ""We will hold a town hall focused on trans women of color. And I hope you'll be there.""

Buttigieg and O'Rourke were one of several 2020 candidates to appear at the town hall hosted by CNN and HRCF in Los Angeles, the day before the 31st anniversary of National Coming Out Day, answering questions on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer issues.

New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro, and businessman Tom Steyer were also scheduled to participate."

Senator Cory Booker, the night's first speaker, was politely laughed at for not answering a yes or no question about whether religious educational institutions that oppose LGBTQ rights should lose their tax-exempt status. Senator Elizabeth Warren had the zinger of the night when asked how she'd respond to an ""old-fashioned"" supporter who told her they believe marriage is between a man and a woman. Warren quipped : ""Then just marry one woman. I'm cool with that...assuming you can find one.""

And then there was former Vice President Joe Biden who suggested the vast majority of Americans are not homophobic but instead are afraid and don't know what to do or say. He finished his time mumbling something about bathhouses. It was as awkward as it sounds.

But the night did not belong to a single candidate but rather a single topic.

Several transgender women of color held small protests inside the town hall sporadically throughout the night in hopes of drawing attention to the string of underreported murders of similar women. According to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), which co-sponsored the event with CNN, more than 26 transgender people were murdered in 2018, most of whom were black transgender women.

So far this year HRC has reported that 19 transgender women have been killed . The lack of media coverage of these deaths is particularly jarring when juxtaposed against the frequent reminders that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots

Those protests, in response to police persecution 50 years ago, are seen as the birth of the modern gay rights movement. And while gays and lesbians, particularly those who happen to be white, have benefited from the steady progression toward cultural acceptance, the trans women who led those protests remain mostly in the shadows.

Perhaps this is why the demonstrations began just when South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg was about to speak. Buttigieg, an openly gay cisgender white male, has become a regular on Sunday morning talk shows and is a bit of a pop culture media darling. The discussion was being moderated by Anderson Cooper, another openly gay cisgender white male who, as a public figure, has seemed to find a high level of acceptance.

There is no question that coming out and living one's truth can be a difficult journey regardless of race or gender identity. But it is far too easy for people of a station and privilege in life—and for viewers who may pat themselves on the back for their broadmindedness -- to not acknowledge the struggles of the trans women of color who have not been as readily accepted despite their historical activism in the movement.

Buttigieg approached this as the protesters were removed: ""I do want to acknowledge what these demonstrators were speaking about, which is the epidemic of violence against black trans women in this country right now."" Ending that epidemic, he said, requires ""lifting up its visibility and speaking to it.""

To his credit, Cooper took a moment to applaud the protesters for their demonstration and acknowledge the lack of media coverage given to the trans community.

Cooper was right: If tens of cisgender gay white males were murdered in a year, it would undoubtedly garner much more media attention.

We should credit the candidates who were asked about their strategy to stop men from killing trans women of color (as one audience member yelled while Senator Kamala Harris was on stage) for at least being well versed on the issue. They spoke of the need to have a Department of Justice that seriously investigated these crimes. They spoke of the need to have an education secretary who was committed to protecting transgender students, something the current secretary has been reluctant to do. More importantly they looked these disenfranchised women in their eyes and they listened to their pain, something the community at large has not been particularly good at doing since the decline of AIDS.

Historically, because of family rejection and housing discrimination , many transgender people do not have the resources to attend a fabulous fundraiser with the promise of one-on-one time with a candidate. In fact, because of these civil rights violations, many must turn to sex work just to survive, a predicament that makes them vulnerable to the violence that has led to so many deaths.

They have been reliant on their gay and lesbian brothers and sisters with deep pockets to take their concerns up the socioeconomic ladder and quite honestly, they have been sorely let down.

Consumed with marriage equality, iconography, and heteronormativity, much of the past 50 years in the movement has been an exercise in white, cisgender, gay advancement despite its black and Latino transgender beginnings. Because of this, the policy improvements the candidates proposed on this historic night are somewhat secondary to the fundamental fight that still needs to be fought.

Citing two people familiar with the inquiry, the paper builds on CNN's previous reporting on Thursday that Giuliani's financial dealings with two associates indicted on campaign finance-related charges were under scrutiny by investigators overseeing the case. Law enforcement officials briefed on the matter told CNN that the FBI and prosecutors in Manhattan are examining Giuliani's involvement in the broader flow of money that has become the focus of alleged violations that are at the center of the charges against Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman.

Both people familiar with the inquiry told the Times that the investigation into Giuliani was tied to that of Fruman and Parnas. One of the people told the Times that investigators are looking into Giuliani's attempts to subvert Marie Yovanovitch, the former American ambassador to Ukraine.

A spokeswoman for Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney in Manhattan, declined to comment to the Times.

Giuliani told the Times that he did not know of any investigations into him, and that he stood by his efforts in Ukraine as appropriate. He asserted that any alleged federal lobbying disclosure violations were baseless because his efforts to disseminate information on Yovanovitch were on behalf of Trump, not Ukrainian prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko.

Fruman and Parnas were booked on a flight to Frankfurt, Germany, to connect to another flight, according to a law enforcement source. Giuliani told The Wall Street Journal on Thursday the men were heading to Vienna and that he wasn't scheduled to meet the two until they returned to Washington -- meaning, by Giuliani's account, the three of them would've been in the same city at the same time but would not be seeing one another.

The Atlantic reported that Giuliani said he ""can't comment on it at this time"" about the circumstances of his planned trip after multiple attempts to contact him Thursday.

Giuliani had lunch with Fruman and Parnas at the Trump International Hotel in Washington hours before the two were arrested, the Journal reported. Giuliani declined to comment to CNN on the report.

After years of claiming that Democrats would wait to see where the facts would lead, hoping that Special Counsel Robert Mueller would deliver the goods on Russia “collusion,” Pelosi decided that she could not wait 24 hours for the facts to emerge.

She had lost control: behind closed doors, she faced a caucus that already backed impeachment: a majority of House Democrats had majority it since August 1, a week after Mueller’s testimony produced a dud.

Regardless of her reasons, the decision was a serious political mistake. The rush to impeachment showed that Pelosi was willing to put politics ahead of facts — and ahead of all the other promises she had made to voters in 2018. The fact that she marched ahead of the evidence — which contradicted the whistleblower’s claims — gave Republicans a reason to rally behind the president. It will also put an asterisk next to the 2020 election, in the event Trump loses.

Pelosi repeated her error on Tuesday. The White House sent her an eight-page letter, citing the Constitution, the law, and judicial precedent, explaining why it would not cooperate with an “impeachment inquiry” that the House had not yet voted to authorize. Such a vote would trigger impeachment rules and procedures designed to ensure fairness.

Pelosi’s response failed to address the White House arguments, and accused Trump of trying “to hide the facts.”

The idea that the target of an investigation cannot insist on a fair procedure, and will be further implicated for trying to assert his or her rights — as Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) stated explicitly last week with Pelosi by his side — is reminiscent of “justice” in totalitarian dictatorships. It is, as Breitbart News noted last week, an echo of the horrors of the “Star Chamber,” which the Framers who wrote the U.S. Constitution’s Bill of Rights were eager to prevent.

Pelosi insists that the Constitution does not require the House to obey a set of rules or procedures for impeachment. She is right. But the Constitution also does not require the White House to comply with an “impeachment inquiry.” If the matter is brought to federal court, the judiciary would likely decline to intervene, citing the political question doctrine. Pelosi will have to hold an impeachment vote without the public ever seeing the evidence — or the defense.

There is another weakness in Pelosi’s approach. She is defending her “impeachment inquiry” based on the argument that she and her party are retraining a lawless president: “Mr. President, you are not above the law,” she declared on Tuesday.

But Pelosi herself is casting aside any set of rules. If the president’s alleged abuse of power is the problem, Pelosi and the Democrats are not providing an alternative. They are simply imposing their own arbitrary reign.

It is worth exploring President Trump’s alleged misconduct in further detail. He is accused of doing what Democrats have said for years that President Barack Obama’s administration had a duty to do: namely, to investigate possible foreign corruption by a presidential candidate. It was a matter of national security, they said, because Russia could use “kompromat” to control the president. (Many continue to claim Trump is doing Vladimir Putin’s bidding.)

The difference in the two cases is that Trump took personal responsibility for asking that Ukraine investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. Obama made a habit of avoiding any personal responsibility for anything controversial in his administration: he left that to underlings, then professed outrage when their misconduct was exposed. Trump not only made the request himself, but also repeated it publicly. He believes he has a duty to do so and is right to do so.

That is a matter for oversight, not impeachment.

It is telling that no one can name a single law that Trump has broken. After the so-called “whistleblower” raised his or her concerns, the Department of Justice (DOJ) investigated the president for allegedly violating campaign finance laws. It is illegal to accept foreign contributions, as two of Rudy Giuliani’s associates found out on Thursday. But the DOJ closed the case on Trump: he did not break the law.

As Democrats told us for years, while their party might have benefited politically from investigating the Trump campaign, that did not matter because there was a legitimate public interest in finding out whether Russian influence extended to a GOP candidate. (Never mind that Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee arguably broke campaign finance laws themselves by disguising payments to dig up dirt on Trump through foreign sources.)

Trump can cite a similar public interest in finding out what the Bidens were up to in Ukraine — all the more so because Joe Biden has admitted to quashing an investigation into a company on which his son, Hunter, was a board member.

Even if the Bidens did not actually do anything wrong, as the suddenly incurious media are rushing to tell us, there is no doubt that Joe Biden had a conflict of interest. The fact that he did not recuse himself was unethical.

But if what Trump did was in the public interest, what about the way he did it? Though there is no evidence of any quid pro quo — which would probably not be illegal anyway — the idea that Trump used a personal call to request that the new Ukrainian president examine both the 2016 election shenanigans and the Bidens’ activities strikes some observers as odd. It suggests that Trump has supposedly erased boundaries between the personal and the national.

Democrats interpret that as evidence of authoritarianism — as they have done with almost everything else Trump has done. If Trump lowers taxes that benefits American businesses as a whole, Democrats and their media allies rush to calculate how much the president’s own business interests might save as a result. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has campaigned for months on the idea that President Trump is benefiting personally from such alleged “corruption.”

Democrats and journalists showed considerable less interest in figuring out why President Obama made a sudden, albeit unsuccessful, pitch for Chicago to host the 2016 Olympics when he flew to Copenhagen in his first year as president. Hosting the Olympics often costs cities more than it is worth. But several of Obama’s Chicago friends — including, supposedly, White House adviser Valerie Jarrett — stood to benefit from an Olympic-sized windfall.

Trump does not operate that way. Indeed, the appeal for his voters was that unlike the Obamas, he had already made a fortune before going into politics (and risked a fortune by doing so). Rather than pursuing his personal interests as if they were the national interest, Trump has made the national interest his personal interest. As he said repeatedly in the 2016 race: “My whole life I’ve been greedy … Now I want to be greedy for the United States.” He is delivering.

His style bothers some constitutional conservatives, whose ideal would be a president who operates more at arm’s length. But Trump may be incapable of functioning any other way. Recall that he made his fortune as the head of a private, family business. He has never had to please shareholders — and may not have succeeded if he needed to do so. For him, personal success and company success are the same. He has brought that approach to the presidency.

That is why Trump often speaks off-the-cuff, even at ostensibly non-political or public events, about how his own performance is supposedly better than those of his predecessors. There is more than ordinary presidential narcissism at work (and Obama, unlike Trump, seemed unable to deliver even a prepared speech without using the first person pronoun incessantly). It is the way a family businessman thinks. It works — but it rubs some people the wrong way.

Democrats have an opportunity to provide an alternative to Trump by advocating a return to a more rules-based way of running the government. Instead, they are doing the opposite.

Pelosi has made it clear that she will not be bound by House precedent and will not follow the basic rules of fairness in the impeachment inquiry. Much of the inquiry thus far has been held behind doors in intelligence hearings, which allows Democrats to leak out-of-context details.

What Pelosi and the Democrats seem to be saying is that the normal rules and rights — which Republicans, even in their own impeachment frenzy, afforded to President Bill Clinton — must be suspended for this particular president. They argue no president is above the law. But no president is beneath it, either. And by protecting leakers like the so-called “whistleblower,” Democrats may even be condoning law-breaking for the “just” cause of ousting Trump.

That approach is not only legally and morally wrong: it is also politically disastrous. Before Pelosi ordered the impeachment inquiry, Trump was largely running against the “socialism” proposed by most Democrat presidential candidates. (In that vein, William Galston — the liberal on the Wall Street Journal op-ed page — warned Democrats this week that Warren, the new frontrunner, is too left-wing for voters in states Democrats must win in 2020.)

Now, Trump is running to defend democracy. Democrats, he argues, want to undo the last election and steal the next one. They cannot be bothered to wait for the voters to deliver their own verdict, mere months from now: they want to usurp the power of the people.

It is an argument for which Democrats have no answer. And if they manage to win in 2020 by using a partisan impeachment to tarnish the president, many Americans will lose faith in our democracy.

There are probably Democrats who think they are doing what is right for the country — just like there were FBI agents, starting with then-Director James Comey, who understood they were bending the rules in 2016 to help Hillary Clinton and hurt Donald Trump, but believed they were protecting the country. They acted as they did because they lacked faith in our constitutional checks and balances, and the wisdom of the American electorate.

Pelosi lacks that same faith — and the proof is that she refuses to authorize the impeachment inquiry with a vote. If she believed the case against Trump were strong, she would not oppose a fair process based on rules and precedent.

She told fellow Democrats that she was undertaking impeachment “prayerfully.” If so, there has never been a more faithless prayer. The Democrats are opposing democracy because they do not believe in it, or the American people.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) advocated for mixed-sex prisons as part of the “LGBTQ+ Rights and Equality” plan she released on Thursday, hours before the Human Rights Campaign’s town hall on CNN.

Warren detailed her proposal in a Medium post, painting a bleak picture of the state of LGBT rights under the Trump administration. She accused the Trump White House of weaponizing the “language of religion” and giving entities a “license to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people.”

While Warren’s proposal contains a swath of promises of protections for LGBT individuals, the presidential hopeful specifically vowed to mix federal prisons, allowing men to move into women’s prisons on the basis of “gender identity” rather than biological sex. She said she would instruct the Bureau of Prisons to house transgender inmates according to their identified sex, much like the Obama administration did in January 2017.

Warren’s plan states:

I will direct the Bureau of Prisons to end the Trump Administration’s dangerous policy of imprisoning transgender people in facilities based on their sex assigned at birth and ensure that all facilities meet the needs of transgender people, including by providing medically necessary care, like transition-related surgeries, while incarcerated.

Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a reversal of the Obama administration’s mixed-sex policy in 2018, determining that it would resume using “biological sex as the initial determination.”

As Breitbart News reported:

Critics said Obama’s transgender policy would have created huge risks of rape because few people who say they are transgender have undergone genital cosmetic surgery, and few can pass as members of the opposite sex. For example, Obama’s policy would allow male criminals into women’s prisons and pressure women-who-say-they-are-men to live in men’s prisons. Sessions’ new policy marks another step in reasserting the normal biology-based legal distinctions between female and male. Those distinctions were being scrubbed from the law by Obama’s pro-transgender policies. Trump has already begun reversing Obama’s pro-transgender policies in K-12 schools, in health care, and the military which now says it classifies soldiers’ sex by using the “bright line based on biological sex.”

Warren previewed her position in the criminal justice reform plan unveiled in August, which specifically called for “special protections” for LGBT individuals behind bars.

This is hardly the first time Warren has courted the transgender community. She applauded a child who claimed to be transgender during CNN’s Equality Town Hall on Thursday evening.

“I want to make sure that the person I think is the right secretary of education meets you and hears your story, and then I want you to tell me if you think that’s the right person and then we’ll make the deal,” Warren said.

Warren also vowed to provide taxpayer-funded sex-reassignment surgery. She outlined that position in her comprehensive LGBT agenda, calling for “gender-affirming” health care.

“I believe that everyone is entitled to medical care and medical care that they need, and that includes people who are transgender, who — it is the time for them to have gender-affirming surgery,” Warren said during the town hall.

“I just think that’s important and the appropriate medical care,” she added.

Warren, however, has not always felt that way. She said in 2012 that she did not find sexual reassignment surgery – for a transgender inmate, specifically – a “good use of taxpayer dollars.”

“I have to say, I don’t think it’s a good use of taxpayer dollars,” she said at the time, only to reverse her position years later."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) for her “authenticity.”

VERDICT: False. Doubts about Warren’s latest tale were first raised by a female socialist.

Thomas Kaplan writes in the New York Times that Republicans and conservatives have questioned Warren’s claim that she was fired from a teaching job in 1971 because she was “visibly pregnant.” In doing so, Kaplan writes, they have “employed a tactic — questioning a female candidate’s authenticity — that is at once often a sexist trope in politics and a strategy used against Hillary Clinton in 2016.”

The article appears as “news analysis,” not opinion.

Unfortunately, for Kaplan, there are three problems. The first is that doubts about Warren’s pregnancy tale were first raised by left-wing Jacobin magazine wrier Meagan Day, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.

All over the internet you can find people calling Elizabeth Warren a “former public school teacher” and saying it was her “first career.” Warren was a public school teacher for one year. She immediately left the classroom, went to law school, and became a law professor. Come on https://t.co/2zeSS5OkeM — Meagan Day (@meaganmday) October 1, 2019

That’s not what she says in this interview: https://t.co/5rXCR5UXha pic.twitter.com/bynQBLjNcd — Meagan Day (@meaganmday) October 1, 2019

Second, Warren has made a habit of telling false stories. For years, she falsely claimed Native American ancestry — and fundraised off (correct) efforts by critics to debunk her story, just as she is doing now with her pregnancy story.

More recently, her campaign has consistently exaggerated crowd sizes at her events, and Warren has repeatedly evaded questions — even from well-meaning liberals — about whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for her “Medicare for All” plan. Warren’s “authenticity” is in doubt because she keeps putting it in doubt.

Third, questioning a candidate’s honesty is the bread-and-butter of politics. Journalists and opponents always challenge what candidates say. To claim that the normal course of politics is a “sexist trope” is absurd. It is also an effort — arguably, a sexist one — to shield a female candidate from scrutiny, as if she could not win on the merits.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has been in contact with radical leftist and failed gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum (D), sparking rumors that the presidential hopeful is considering him as a potential running mate.

Warren has been in contact with Gillum — the radical leftist who lost Florida’s gubernatorial race to Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) last fall — according to the Daily Beast:

And for several candidates, including at least one in the top tier, former Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum is on speed dial. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), in particular, has been in contact with Gillum over the past several months, multiple knowledgeable sources told The Daily Beast.

While the Warren campaign says that the vice presidential rumors are “baseless and not at all true,” sources who spoke to the Daily Beast said that their relationship is reminiscent of the search process a candidate typically goes through in order to find the right running mate:

One source briefed on the communications said the two Democrats have been in contact over the course of the campaign and that there is a “strong impression” that Gillum is a possible vice presidential contender for Warren, who has risen in recent months to become a frontrunner in the 2020 primary, the source said. “If you’re trying to win Florida, I would be courting Andrew and that’s what’s happening,” a second source familiar with the conversations said.

Gillum rose to the national spotlight after challenging DeSantis in Florida’s close gubernatorial race last year, earning the support of celebrities like pop sensation Rihanna and rap star Sean “Diddy” Combs. Despite a strong backing from Hollywood, Gillum lost. DeSantis narrowly squeaked out a win in the Sunshine State, besting Gillum by less than half a percentage point, or less than 325,000 votes.

Gillum largely campaigned on many of the far-left’s go-to narratives, such as Medicare for All, gun control, and increased taxation — three issues that particularly resonate with Warren.

As Breitbart News reported in July, Gillum is utilizing his private non-profit in an effort to register 1 million voters and ultimately flip Florida blue. His use of the private non-proft is of interest, as Gillum previously decried the use of “dark money” in politics. By using his private non-profit for such an effort, he can “can disclose much less financial data, including the sources of donations”:

Gillum’s use of the nonprofit, calling itself Forward Florida Action, is notable given the Florida politician’s warning last February about the influence of “dark money” in his own race for governor, referring to entities that obscure their donors. Gillum is deploying his nonprofit for the voter registration drive instead of utilizing his political committee, Forward Florida. … The change came after the Tampa Bay Timesreported in May that the FBI had subpoenaed records related to his 2018 gubernatorial campaign. This after Gillum’s time as Tallahassee mayor was tied to an FBI probe into city hall corruption, a federal investigation that involved undercover FBI agents going on trips with Gillum.

Like Warren, Gillum has called for Trump’s impeachment and has remained a voice for the far-left flank of the Democrat Party.

Gillum subtly addressed the reports of his conversations with Warren in a tweet on Thursday.

“Many of my friends running to beat @realDonaldTrump call me often — about one thing: how to win Florida,” he wrote, plugging his voter registration drive:"

The audience member, identified as Morgan Cox III, asked Warren what she would say to supporters who indicate that their faith teaches them that marriage is between a man and a woman.

“Let’s say you’re on the campaign trail … and a supporter approaches you and says, ‘Senator, I am old-fashioned, and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.’ What is your response?” he asked.

“Well, I’m going to assume it’s a guy who said that,” Warren said. “And I’m going to say, ‘Then just marry one woman.’ I’m cool with that.”

“Assuming you can find one,” she added, prompting laughter.

Warren’s campaign boasted of her “viral” answer, which they say garnered over 12 million views in 15 hours:

According to Fox News, the man who set Warren up for the viral response was a friendly face, who sits on the HRC Board of Directors, which partnered with CNN to hold the town hall. Donor data also suggests that a man fitting Cox’s description donated $5,400 to Warren in the past — $2,700 in July 2017 and $2,700 in April 2018, Fox News reports.

Warren made waves at the town hall after signaling support for taxpayer-funded “gender-affirming surgery” for inmates and praising a child who claimed to be transgender.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said she was wrong about a previous statement she made during her 2012 campaign for U.S. Senate calling gender-reassignment surgery for inmates not a “good use of taxpayer dollars.”

In her revised view, Warren called the operation “important and appropriate” when posed the question by CNN host Chris Cuomo.

Partial transcript as follows:

CUOMO: Senator, quick follow. Speak to your evolution on this. In the 2012 campaign for Senate, you criticized a judge’s ruling that granted transition-related surgery to a transgender inmate. You said, “I don’t think it’s a good use of taxpayer dollars.”

WARREN: Right.

CUOMO: Do you regret that?

WARREN: Yep. No, it was a bad answer. And I think it was a bad answer. And I believe that everyone is entitled to medical care and medical care that they need, and that includes people who are transgender, who — it is the time for them to have gender-affirming surgery. I just think that’s important and the appropriate medical care.

CUOMO: So if you help people get to where they want to be, you also have to protect them as what they are. Do you think that a crime against somebody who is transgender should be charged as a hate crime in statute?

WARREN: You know, I think we could if we think that’s going to be the most effective way to make change. So I’m certainly — I’m open to this. But I’ll tell you what I really want. I want a Justice Department that takes this seriously. I want to create a Justice Department that says these crimes matter.

And when they’re not federal crimes, when they are state crimes, in the same way that our Justice Department is empowered to step in if a state is failing to enforce laws and as a result it’s leaving women unprotected, it’s leaving people of color unprotected, the same should happen for LGBTQ people. We need a Justice Department that is on the side of the people, all of the people."

“By the way, looks like Bernie lost his chance,” Trump said. “Bernie was hitting a baseball today to show how strong he was. There just wasn’t a lot of bat head speed.”

“Playoff baseball comes to our backyard,” Sanders wrote alongside the video featuring himself swinging a bat:

“Bernie get better fast. But Bernie– get better fast,” Trump said, remarking that it was “the only time I’ve ever said anything good about him.”

“But boy did they take advantage of him four years ago, and he let them do it,” Trump continued. “You can’t do that. You can’t let people take advantage. He figured ‘I’ll wait four years.’ That’s a little bit tough.”

Trump predicted that when Sanders – who has fallen to a distant third in recent national polls – inevitably drops out, supporters will flock to Warren, and that will “unfortunately be the end of Sleepy Joe.”

“But it looks like when Bernie gets out – which seems inevitable – when Bernie gets out, it looks like those will go to your radical leftist Elizabeth Warren,” Trump said, sparking boos.

“And that will, unfortunately, be the end of Sleepy Joe,” Trump continued, adding that he would “most like” to run against him, quickly noting that he does not really have a strong preference.

The campaign wrote:

They came from all 50 states, and nearly 20% of our donors gave to us for the first time this quarter. And most impressively, we did this while not fundraising during the 12 day period around the El Paso shooting because that tragedy wasn’t about our campaign, it was about our community.

However, O’Rourke’s team admitted that the amount raised is “not what we thought we’d be able to do given all of the other indicators we’re seeing.”

“Voters like what Beto has to say. When they meet him in person, they like him even more. In fact, our modeling shows a correlation between the counties Beto visits and an increase in his favorability,” his campaign argued.

The campaign diagnosed the problem, writing, “People think this is a two-person race.”

“We’re stuck in what we’ve been calling the ‘Media Trap,’ where the media is treating this race like it’s over, despite the fact that only 9% of voters have made up their mind,” it claimed, adding that it sees a “no-bullshit path for Beto.”

“We see a no-bullshit path for Beto and for our people-powered campaign—and a real, serious one,” his campaign wrote. “More than that, though, we see that we need to bypass the media trap and we need to do it quickly.”

The campaign outlined a few of the things that need to happen to help O’Rourke break through. The plan includes launching an advertising blitz, beefing up national organizers, and focusing on early primary states.

O’Rourke’s third-quarter haul pales in comparison to his competitors’ numbers:

In June, the majority of 2020 Democrats running for president — including Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — endorsed a plan that would force American taxpayers to provide free health care to all 11 to 22 million illegal aliens in the U.S. and anyone else who crosses the southern border.

The latest study by Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) researchers reveals that providing health care to all illegal aliens would cost American taxpayers up to $23 billion a year should every illegal alien enroll. This total includes at least 2.5 million low-income illegal aliens and their children who would cost almost $13 billion a year, alone, to be given health care.

Even if only about five million illegal aliens enroll in federal subsidies for health care, American taxpayers would be forced to foot a $10.4 billion bill every year, CIS researchers conclude. Overall, providing taxpayer-funded health care to each illegal alien costs Americans about $4,600 a year.

With a scenario in which higher-income illegal aliens are enrolled in Obamacare and poorer illegal aliens take Medicaid, that plan would still cost Americans nearly $20 billion a year assuming every illegal alien enrolls. Based on current enrollment trends, a lower enrollment rate among illegal aliens would nonetheless cost Americans $10.7 billion a year.

Previously, Breitbart News estimated, based on CIS analysis, that providing illegal aliens with taxpayer-funded health care would cost Americans about $66 billion every year and $660 billion every decade. This assumed that every illegal alien enrolled and each cost $3,000 to insure.

While 2020 Democrats have made giving health care to illegal aliens — paid for by U.S. taxpayers — a priority, experts have said that such a policy would drive “strong incentives for people with serious health problems to enter the country or remain longer than their visas allow in order to get government-funded care.”

The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds that the 2020 Democrats’ health care for illegal aliens plan is the most unpopular policy position thus far in the race for president with opposition from 62 percent of all likely voters.

Today, Americans are forced to subsidize about $18.5 billion of yearly medical costs for illegal aliens living in the U.S., according to estimates by Chris Conover, formerly of the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research at Duke University.

During a rally in Lake Charles, Louisiana on Friday night, Trump slammed Democrats for failing to work with his administration to stop illegal immigration, and he thanked Mexico for its cooperation and putting troops on the Mexican side of the border.

Trump said:

On issue after issue, Democrats have put the needs of foreign citizens ahead of our own citizens. We protect borders of other countries, but we don’t protect our own borders. But I want to thank Mexico … 27,000 Mexican soldiers are on our border and you see the numbers, they plummeted … all because the Democrats wouldn’t approve simple changes to what we call the loopholes.

“So Mexico has helped us more at our border than the Democrats,” Trump said. “Honestly, they’re terrible.”

Trump said it is no wonder that foreign nationals flood the nation’s border when every leading 2020 Democrat — including Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — has promised to provide free, taxpayer-funded healthcare to all 11 to 22 million illegal aliens, a program that would cost anywhere between $23 to $66 billion every year.

Trump said”

And then you wonder why they come to America. Why wouldn’t they come? Free healthcare, free education, free everything … the Democrat vision of America is to rob American taxpayers to fund socialism for the entire world. If you don’t want Democrats to raid your healthcare, steal your money, overcrowd your schools, and overwhelm your communities, then you have only one choice, you have to go out tomorrow, vote Republican. Get John Bel Edwards the hell out of office.

As Breitbart News has reported, Trump has negotiated deals with Mexico to increase border controls on the Mexican side of the border to stop illegal aliens from crossing into the U.S. The most notable is Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy that ends the process by which border crossers are released into the interior of the country and instead returned to Mexico, preventing mass asylum fraud.

The remark came after Buttigieg, who is the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, was asked about whether bullying that causes suicide should have legal ramifications.

“I believe it’s one of the things that could help,” Buttigieg said. “There are still states — I live in one of them — that don’t have hate crime legislation.”

“And we need to make sure that our legislation reflects our values as a country and the insistence that nobody be singled out or harmed because of who they are,” Buttigieg said.

He continued:

But that’s just the beginning of what we’ve got to do for LGBTQ youth. We know that LGBTQ youth are much more likely to experience homelessness, which is one of the reasons why we need to invest more in youth homelessness in general and do the opposite of what this president is doing, which is allowing rules to go forward that would actually make it harder for transgender youth to access homeless services.

“That is just wrong, and it will end in my administration,” Buttigieg said.

In fact, while the HUD rule — posted in spring 2019 — does allow for shelters to make decisions based on privacy and safety, it specifically states that discrimination based on “sexual orientation and gender identity” will not take place:

This proposed rule provides that grant recipients, subrecipients, owners, operators, managers, and providers (Shelter Providers) under HUD programs which permit single-sex or sex-segregated facilities (such as bathrooms or temporary, emergency shelters and other buildings and facilities with physical limitations or configurations that require and are permitted to have shared sleeping quarters or bathing facilities) may establish a policy, consistent with state and local law, by which such Shelter Provider considers an individual’s sex for the purposes of determining accommodation within such shelters and for purposes of determining sex for admission to any facility or portion thereof. The proposed rule permits Shelter Providers to consider a range of factors in making such determinations, including privacy, safety, practical concerns, religious beliefs, any relevant considerations under civil rights and nondiscrimination authorities , the individual’s sex as reflected in official government documents, as well as the gender which a person identifies with. The proposed rule does not dictate a required basis for making determinations other than that they be consistent with an overall policy. The proposed rule continues HUD’s policy of ensuring that its programs are open to all eligible individuals and families regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.

Buttigieg joined eight other Democrat candidates at the marathon town hall, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), as well as former HUD Secretary Julian Castro (D), former Vice President Joe Biden (D), former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX), and Tom Steyer (D).

By exploiting a leaker’s hearsay to turn an innocuous phone call my father made to his Ukrainian counterpart into grist for the impeachment mill, the Democrats and their allies made their objective transparent: They want the 2020 presidential election to be strictly about this phony controversy.

They certainly don’t want to contest this administration’s record in next year’s election, and they definitely don’t want to test my father’s popularity with the American people. They’d much prefer to leave the outcome of the 2020 election in the hands of the Beltway establishment and the elite-approved media. This Ukraine “scandal” is merely a vehicle to allow them to do the latter and avoid the former.

Let me be clear: There was nothing illegal, improper, or even remotely impeachable about my father’s phone call with President Zelensky.

Hunter Biden, on the other hand, took a $600,000-a-year job with a notoriously corrupt foreign company despite being woefully unqualified. This was almost certainly due entirely to his father’s perceived influence as the Vice President of the United States at the time — the same influence the elder Biden used, by his own admission, to pressure Ukraine into firing the prosecutor investigating his son’s firm.

That needs to be investigated, as does the equally suspicious circumstances surrounding Hunter’s trip to China with his father while Hunter was in the midst of negotiations for $1.5 billion in Chinese cash. Fortunately, Senator Lindsey Graham has pledged to invite Rudy Giuliani to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, so we’ll soon know a lot more about those shady dealings.

Whatever role Ukrainian nationals and firms operating in Ukraine may have played in laying the groundwork for what became the Russiagate hoax also must be investigated. My father has said this, publicly. Attorney General Bill Barr has said this, publicly. His subordinates at the Justice Department have said this, publicly.

Why on Earth would anyone be surprised that my father would ask foreign leaders with the ability to assist those investigations to do so? Considering that the same Democrats who are now clamoring for impeachment themselves asked the Ukrainians to assist in investigating my father, how can any of them claim with a straight face that my father acted improperly, let alone call for his impeachment?

As Sen. Graham’s hearings will no doubt reveal, corruption has been endemic in Ukraine for many years. It would have been downright irresponsible for the President of the United States to ignore that issue before handing over hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars.

In short, none of them actually believe this nonsense. The Democrats are simply hoping to tarnish my father’s political standing before the voters have to start evaluating the choice between Donald Trump and whichever far-left radical the Democrats nominate to run against him.

Indeed, the left’s hysterical reactions to Ukrainegate are just recitations of the same attacks they’ve been making since before my father was even elected.

Deranged lawyer George Conway just wrote a rambling, 11,000+ word opinion article pretending to be a psychologist judging my father as mentally unfit for office. J.W. Verret, who briefly served on my father’s transition team, is convinced that Ukrainegate is worse than Watergate — “a lot worse,” in fact.

Liberal journalist Paul Brandus goes even further. Not only is my father “much worse than Richard Nixon,” Brandus contends that he’s actually a traitor to America!

Doesn’t this sound familiar? It should.

Worse than Watergate? Anyone making that claim this week is obviously slow on the draw. Watergate one-hit wonder Carl Bernstein was using the “worse than Watergate” line back in November 2017. One of the men who wound up in prison as a result of Bernstein’s reporting, John Dean, was convinced that my father had breached the “worse than Watergate” wall in May 2017, just four months after taking the oath of office.

George Conway thinks my father is unfit for his office? The same USA Today editorial board that published Brandus’s “treason” claim broke decades of policy to say the exact same thing … in September 2016, before my father was even elected.

Speaking of treason, NBC News was accusing my father of treason in July 2016 — before he was even the Republican nominee — over a joke. It only took another year for the Democrats to accuse me of the same thing without a shred of truth.

Yet, they expect you to believe their latest hysterics about a phone call with Ukraine. It’s a joke, and not a very funny one, at that. Even the people making the claims reveal so much with their own behavior. J.W. Verret — a professor whom the media is presenting as a former Trump supporter won over by the evidence of wrongdoing in Ukrainegate — was calling for impeachment months ago, when this Ukraine “whistleblower” scheme wasn’t even a twinkle in Adam Schiff’s eye.

Schiff, the Jussie Smollet of American politics, is trying to make this about Ukraine. As I hope you can see, it just doesn’t wash. This impeachment farce is solely about preventing a repeat of the greatest political embarrassment in the modern history of the Democratic Party: my father’s victory in 2016.

The prospect that the Democrats will be able to unseat my father in a fair election are fading fast. Hunter Biden’s scandals, along with a series of embarrassing gaffes and apparent “senior moments” on the debate stage have crippled the Democrats’ putative front-runner, Joe Biden. The corresponding ascendance of Senator Elizabeth Warren makes it increasingly likely that the Democrats will nominate a candidate from the Party’s far-left wing, which is woefully out of step with the American mainstream.

Democrats evidently feel that the 2020 presidential election cannot be left to chance. They don’t want to give the American people the option of making the same “mistake” twice. Nothing else adequately explains this impeachment push.

Michael Anton famously wrote at the time that 2016 was the “Flight 93” election — the final chance for Americans to regain control over the airplane of state before it fell forever into the hands of Hillary Clinton and her vast network of swamp creatures, who would create conditions under which the people would never be able to choose their own destiny again.

Three years ago, Americans rose to the occasion. They chose the future they wanted, and, since January 2017, my father has worked tirelessly to deliver it to them. The would-be impeachers on Capitol Hill are desperately trying, as they have throughout, to take that choice back and ensure that the American people are never given such an opportunity for autonomy again.

They are trying to use the Ukraine hoax to override the will of the people, and they aren’t even being subtle about it.

Speaking to residents of the Villages in Ocala, Florida, Trump said while Democrats are seeking to expand Medicare so that “all” Americans can be on government-run socialized medicine, he intends to protect it, keep it for seniors only, and improve it by providing more options within the Medicare Advantage program and reducing its costs.

“Together, we’re creating a healthcare system that protects vulnerable patients, makes healthcare more affordable, gives you more choice and control, and delivers the high-quality care Americans deserve,” Trump told seniors in Florida. “And that’s what we’re doing — we’re strengthening our healthcare system to a level that nobody thought would be possible.”

Though the president’s executive order does not change any current policy by itself, it will launch necessary regulatory proposals by federal agencies, particularly the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Here are five ways Trump’s executive order seeks to strengthen Medicare:

Brings Medicare up to date and provides more plan choices:

Within a year, Trump would like to see the HHS secretary propose a regulation that enables Medicare “to provide beneficiaries with more diverse and affordable plan choices.”

The president wants to “encourage innovative … benefit structures and plan designs” in Medicare Advantage, the program that allows millions of older Americans to access various private health insurers at lower cost due to Medicare subsidies.

In his order, Trump says he wants to “reduce barriers to obtaining Medicare Medical Savings Accounts” and to “promote innovations in supplemental benefits and telehealth services.”

Healthcare analyst Christopher Jacobs, CEO of Juniper Research Group, explained at the Federalist that Medicare Medical Savings Accounts are “a health savings account-like mechanism that gives beneficiaries incentives to serve as smart consumers of health care.”

“To accomplish that last objective, the order references broader access to cost and quality data, ‘improving [seniors’] ability to make decisions about their health care that work best for them,’” Jacobs noted.

Younger Americans are gradually becoming more aware of the costs of healthcare services and prescription drugs. Many are using apps that help them assess the cost of a service or drug by various providers and pharmacies. Trump’s order reflects that the practice of deciding what is best for each individual patient does not end when an American turns 65. When more Americans of any age seek the best quality health care at the lowest price, the costs of those services will come down.

Encourages “enhanced access” to health care:

The implementation of Trump’s executive order would allow more older Americans to access to health care services through telemedicine and other technologies.

Jacobs noted this feature could especially be helpful to seniors in rural areas.

Very importantly, the order also seeks to take on states whose restrictions curtail competition in healthcare access and, thus, lead to limited provider networks in Medicare Advantage plans.

Seeks elimination of regulatory burdens for providers:

The executive order demands further improvement of Medicare by “eliminating burdensome regulatory billing requirements, conditions of participation, and other requirements that serve as obstacles to more providers participating in the program, including physician assistants and nurse practitioners.

In a press statement, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) commended Trump for taking “bold steps toward increasing the ability of American seniors to choose the medical care and insurance options best for them, instead of being trapped within increasingly insolvent government-run programs.”

“AAPS thanks President Trump for the options he is granting seniors, and the physicians who care for them, in Section 11 of the Executive Order aimed at curbing the further encroachment of socialized medicine in the United States,” said AAPS Executive Director Jane M. Orient, M.D.

Allows Medicare patients to directly receive monetary savings for using healthcare services that provide the best care at the least cost:

Trump’s order wants older Americans to reap the benefits of learning about costs in healthcare services by directly providing them with rebates and allowing them to share in the savings of the updated program.

Ends the Clinton-era rule that required older Americans who wished to opt out of government-run Medicare Part A to forfeit their Social Security benefits:

The president’s executive order finally demands a change in the 1993 rule that required Medicare and Social Security to be linked together. The Clinton administration wrote the rule that states seniors cannot opt out of Medicare without giving up their Social Security benefits, even though they had been forced to pay into Social Security for years.

The order states:

Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary, in coordination with the Commissioner of Social Security, shall revise current rules or policies to preserve the Social Security retirement insurance benefits of seniors who choose not to receive benefits under Medicare Part A, and propose other administrative improvements to Medicare enrollment processes for beneficiaries.

“It is unethical, not to mention contrary to basic common sense, to insist that American seniors only receive care through Medicare,” said Orient.

AAPS added:

Medicare’s Hospital Trust Fund will be depleted by 2026 and over the next 10-15 years, counting the Trust Funds as assets rather than taxpayer liabilities, the Medicare program is only 71% funded under trustees’ unfavorable assumptions, and 91% under favorable assumptions. Giving seniors the ability to escape this faltering program will help ease the looming crisis as well as give American’s access to options that work best for them, not government bureaucrats.

The Clinton-era rule was challenged by a nonprofit group seeking healthcare freedom, but, in 2011, a federal judge ruled in favor of the Obama administration and stated “requiring a mechanism for plaintiffs and others in their situation to ‘dis-enroll’ would be contrary to congressional intent, which was to provide ‘mandatory’ benefits under Medicare Part A and for those receiving Social Security Retirement benefits.”

“Plaintiffs are trapped in a government program intended for their benefit,” U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer continued. “They disagree and wish to escape. The Court can find no loophole or requirement that the Secretary provide such a pathway.”

Under Trump’s order, individuals would still be required to pay Medicare taxes, but if they chose private health insurance, they could opt out of the government-run program without forfeiting their Social Security benefits.

Jacobs observed the proposal “stands as a common-sense solution to our entitlement shortfalls.”

“After all, why should we force someone like Bill Gates or Warren Buffett to accept Medicare benefits if they are perfectly content to use other forms of health coverage?” he reasoned.

Orient emphasized the need to increase patient freedom, rather than adopt “Medicare for All,” which will eliminate choice.

“Widening escape hatches from an insolvent program and other looming Medicare changes, that will deteriorate patient care and limit their options, is needed now more than ever,” she said."

349,"Brian Fung, CNN",,"A days-long feud between Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Facebook intensified over the weekend as Warren openly accused the company of ""taking money to promote lies.""",2019-10-13,CNN,Elizabeth Warren escalates Facebook ad feud,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/13/politics/elizabeth-warren-facebook-feud/index.html,"(CNN) A days-long feud between Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Facebook intensified over the weekend as Warren openly accused the company of ""taking money to promote lies.""

Warren, a leading Democratic 2020 candidate, has taken aim at the social media giant over its role in spreading disinformation against her and other candidates. Her campaign ran an ad on Facebook this past week that contained a deliberate lie to draw further attention to the issue.

That provocative move came after a recording leaked earlier this month of CEO Mark Zuckerberg telling employees that a Warren presidency would ""suck"" for the company.

Facebook fired back at Warren over the weekend via another social media platform, Twitter, where the company compared itself to broadcast television stations that ran the Trump ad and are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission.

The ""FCC doesn't want broadcast companies censoring candidates' speech,"" Facebook said in a tweet. ""We agree it's better to let voters -- not companies -- decide.""

The comparison opened the door to additional scrutiny of Facebook's role in handling political speech. Facebook declined to comment for this story.

In response, Warren said the company's decision to compare itself to heavily regulated broadcasters raised even more questions about how it should be managed.

""You're making my point here,"" she tweeted. ""It's up to you whether you take money to promote lies.""

The episode underscores how Facebook is trying to maintain its position as a neutral platform even as it acquires ever more influence over public discourse and information -- and as it seeks to address weaknesses that made it a vehicle for Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

Under current policy, Facebook exempts ads by politicians from third-party fact-checking -- a loophole, Warren says, that allows Zuckerberg to continue taking ""gobs of money"" from President Donald Trump's campaign despite Trump's ads telling untruths about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Trump's efforts to pursue unfounded claims about the Bidens are at the heart of the burgeoning impeachment inquiry facing the President.

The Warren fight over ads highlights the collapsing distinction between traditional broadcast media and 21st-century digital platforms, experts say, raising fresh questions about how decades-old regulations concerning political speech should apply to massive online platforms that can influence millions of voters.

And according to some legal analysts, it exposes the limits of Facebook's arguments that it is not a media company.

Beginning with the Radio Act of 1927, Congress mandated that radio stations, and later TV stations, cannot pick and choose which political candidates' ads to run.

Broadcasters may choose not to air political ads at all, though that is rare in today's media environment and the law still requires them to carry ads by federal candidates, said Harold Feld, senior vice president at the technology think tank Public Knowledge. But broadcasters that do accept political ads must air all advertisements from qualified candidates, without a view toward their truthfulness or accuracy.

Broadcasters can still decline to air political ads from non-candidates, such as political action committees. And none of these rules apply to cable networks, which is why CNN could legally decline to air the Trump ad.

Facebook's comparison to broadcasters raises difficult questions about whether it is appropriate to import rules meant for TV and radio stations to the internet, Feld said.

""We face the same choices that we had when radio and television were the big gatekeepers,"" he said. ""How much discretion do you want to give to these powerful shapers of public opinion while still being faithful to the principles of the First Amendment and letting the public decide?""

Broadcasters also obey a slew of other rules that companies such as Facebook do not, Feld said -- should Facebook have to comply with those as well?

For example, the government limits how many stations a media company may own in a particular market to limit anti-competitive behavior. Other FCC regulations require broadcasters to air a certain amount of children's programming, or to air sensitive content only after certain hours.

For a platform that targets content to users based on their interests and according to detailed data, reworking such rules for Facebook could be immensely complex and perhaps inadvisable, said Andrew Schwartzman, senior counselor to the Benton Foundation Institute for Broadband & Society, a civil society group.

""You can't apply that effectively, probably, to cable -- but certainly not to internet platforms,"" he said. ""It's just impossible.""

Facebook's reference to broadcasters also highlights a double standard. Schwartzman added that Facebook wants the benefit of the doubt afforded to regulated broadcasters, but ""without the responsibility of being a regulated broadcaster.""

Even those who have represented the broadcast industry say it is an odd and challenging position for Facebook to adopt.

""Facebook obviously doesn't want to be regulated like a broadcaster, so in a way it's strange they're citing this,"" said Jack Goodman, a former general counsel for the National Association of Broadcasters. ""Because they're not regulated, and they certainly don't want to be regulated.""

Warren's ads, which began running widely on Thursday, started with a bold but obvious falsehood: That Facebook and Zuckerberg had endorsed Trump's reelection campaign.

""You're probably shocked,"" read the ad, which reached tens of thousands of viewers nationwide. ""And you might be thinking, 'how could this possibly be true?' Well, it's not.""

On Saturday, Warren explained her ad was meant ""to see just how far"" the policy goes.

""We intentionally made a Facebook ad with false claims and submitted it to Facebook's ad platform to see if it'd be approved,"" she tweeted. ""It got approved quickly."""

351,"Analysis by Harry Enten, CNN",,First things first: The theme song of the week is the closing credits to Timon & Pumbaa.,2019-10-12,CNN,"Why it's Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and then everybody else",https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/12/politics/joe-biden-elizabeth-warren-polls/index.html,"A new Fox News poll of Democratic primary voters nationwide finds that 32% want former Vice President Joe Biden to be the Democratic presidential nominee in 2020. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren comes in at 22%. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders stands at 17%. No one else polls better than 5%.

An average of polls taken since the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump began have Biden at 29%, Warren at 25%, Sanders at 15% and no one else above 5%.

What's the point: Right now, there's little doubt that Biden and Warren are the top tier in the Democratic primary fight. With the exception of Sanders, no one is even close to Biden and Warren nationally. The question now is how likely are we to be looking at the potential nominee when focusing on the top three at this point.

A look back at history suggests there is a high likelihood that either Biden, Sanders or Warren will be the Democratic nominee.

There have been 16 primaries in the modern era in which an incumbent was not running in said primary. For those 16, I looked at the polling averages for each candidate who ultimately ran or was running in the second half of the year before the primary. These averages were calculated by FiveThirtyEight

There have been a number of candidates not close to leading in the polls at this point who went on to win the nomination. A trailing candidate has gone on to win 7 of 16 times (44%). You may recall Barack Obama was trailing Hillary Clinton at this point in the 2008 Democratic primary. Of course, Obama was running second to Clinton.

When you look outside the top three polling candidates in past primaries, there really hasn't been a lot of success. Only three times has a candidate not in the top three at this point won a nomination. Those were George McGovern in 1972, Jimmy Carter in 1976 and John Kerry in 2004.

Another way to look at this is to look at the percentage everyone was polling at. When the leader in the national polls in the second half of the year before the primary was at greater than 20% (12 times), there has been just one instance of someone polling below 15% going on to win the nomination: McGovern in 1972. And even he was polling at 6%, which is greater than all the Democrats outside of the top three at this point in the 2020 cycle.

We can formalize this analysis through a simple model looking at where candidates were polling and whether they won the nomination. When one candidate is polling at about 30% and another is polling at about 25% in contests with no incumbent running, together they have about 75% chance of winning the nomination. Add in a candidate polling at about 15%, the chance that one of the top three wins is about 85%.

Indeed, the average of our three statistical exercises suggest there's about an 85% chance Biden, Warren or Sanders wins the nomination.

This means that the national polls indicate the chance that someone not named Biden, Sanders or Warren wins the nomination is about 15%.

Now, 15% isn't nothing. It leaves open the possibility that one of the candidates at 5% or below may end up strongly challenging for the nomination. The fact that there are so many of them this year perhaps heightens the chance of a non-top three polling candidate wins this year. Perhaps, it will be someone like South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is polling very close to the top three in Iowa

Still, the most likely outcome is that the Democratic nominee will be Biden, Sanders or Warren, with Biden and Warren having particularly strong chances."

1. More upheaval at Homeland Security

""He had actually been able to curb border crossings and implement some of the administration's harshest policies, but he never really developed a trust with the President,"" Washington Post White House reporter Josh Dawsey said.

""Immigration is the core issue of his presidency,"" Dawsey said. ""So he has to find the fifth person in three years to lead the agency that's really key to his reelection.""

2. Democrats move closer to obtaining Trump's taxes

Democrats are closer than ever to getting their hands on a copy of Trump's tax returns.

The DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Friday that Congress has every right to subpoena Trump's accounting firm for the returns as part of its oversight authority.

""The courts are starting to come to House Democrats' rescue,"" Washington Post congressional reporter Rachael Bade said. ""The problem for them is that the President of course is going to appeal this decision -- all of the decisions are going to end up in the Supreme Court, so it might not matter for now because they're going to keep dragging this out.""

Bade said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has suggested legislation that would require courts to move faster -- though it would have to pass the Republican-controlled Senate to become law.

3. A runoff in Louisiana

Bad news for Democrats in Saturday's Louisiana gubernatorial election.

Incumbent Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards failed to secure 50% of the vote against two Republicans who split the GOP vote -- which means now he's got a tougher one-on-one race with Republican Eddie Rispone.

""That makes his prospects much more difficult,"" Associated Press Washington Bureau Chief Julie Pace said, adding that it's a bad omen for the few Democratic elected officials left in the South.

""Edwards is the perfect profile for a Democrat in the deep South,"" Pace said. ""Another Democrat to watch in a similar circumstance is Alabama's Doug Jones, he's up for reelection next year. And Democrats need to hang on to that seat if they have any prospects of getting the Senate back. They have really, really tough prospects in the South.""

4. Warren on health care

But can the 2020 Democratic presidential contender get away with that line again at Tuesday's debate?

""I'm going to be looking out for how she responds to questions about Medicare for all,"" Wall Street Journal national political reporter Tarini Parti said. ""This is an issue her primary opponents have really been questioning her on, how she's going to pay for it.""

Parti said a source familiar with Warren's thinking told her they don't know yet what Medicare for All would cost, and so don't know yet what kind of revenue is needed to pay for it.

""So that's why they say she isn't responding to whether it's going to lead to an increase in taxes or not,"" Parti said. ""Different plans have different costs associated with them, so they're still trying to figure that part out.""

5. What's Gabbard's game?

And from CNN senior political reporter Nia-Malika Henderson:

While Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has said she is ""seriously considering"" boycotting Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate over what she says is a rigged process, our guess is that the Democratic presidential candidate will very likely be there in Ohio.

And if her July debate appearance is any guide, a few people on that stage should worry. Gabbard has proven to be a wild card in the Democratic primary, where she is polling at about 2%.

She got the best of California Sen. Kamala Harris in a previous debate, and Tuesday is a chance for a rematch. And for Gabbard it's also a chance to go after any number of other candidates -- like South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar -- as they vie to move up in the polls.

While those candidates look to make gains by going after candidates in the center of the stage, they might also want to be ready for what could come from the far ends of it, where some of the sharpest attacks have often been launched by candidates with little to lose."

We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.

(CNN) This week was a kaleidoscope in Trump's Washington, a big picture moving and twisting -- tax records, subpoenas, arrests, foreign policy reversals -- stories reshaping, shifting, blending, it seemed, by the hour. Or, to borrow a different metaphor, a soap opera -- only a very serious one: ""Like sands through the hourglass, so are the days of our lives.""

The sand seemed to be slipping a lot faster for some. On Thursday, two associates of Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, were indicted. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were charged with campaign finance violations involving Ukraine. The indictment alleged that the two men enlisted the help of a sitting congressman to remove or recall the US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch), and posed the question everyone was asking: ""What does this mean for the Trump impeachment investigation?""

Short answer: we don't know yet. ""We know that both Parnas and Fruman helped Giuliani to try to dig up dirt on the Bidens. But the question of whether that relationship overlaps with criminal conduct is a mystery, for now,"" concluded Polisi. Giuliani's standing with President Trump was cast into sharp doubt on Friday, the same day that Yovanovitch testified behind closed doors on Capitol Hill, reportedly making explosive statements -- about Giuliani, his associates, Trump -- and lamenting a ""State Department attacked and hollowed out from within.""

Speaking of closing the book, Shepard Smith bid a surprise farewell to Fox News on Friday. With his announcement, Smith revealed something important about the state of conservative politics, said: there is little room for anyone who questions the status quo in most parts of the Republican universe.

Kathleen Parker in the Washington Post: ""No one who enters Trump's orbit leaves unscathed."" Pick your own metaphor for the impeachment inquiry, but it's a safe bet the kaleidoscope (and the hourglass too) will be getting a workout in the days ahead. put it well in the Washington Post: ""No one who enters Trump's orbit leaves unscathed.""

A number of commentators (and politicians, including among the GOP leadership) had strong words in response to Trump's decision, after a call Sunday with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to pull American forces out of northeastern Syria. Peter Bergen noted that the move essentially greenlighted a Turkish invasion ""that is exposing America's Kurdish allies to the wrath of the second-largest military in NATO"".

Bergen called Trump ""clueless,"" a master in the ""Art of Creating a Crisis,"" and drew a line connecting the commander in chief's mystifying Syria policy with equally confounding approaches to Iran, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan and North Korea.

Pursuing equality, living with whiplash

Samantha Allen, that many LGBTQ Americans -- watching their rights teeter on the judicial brink while under the political spotlight -- have whiplash.) On Tuesday, LGTBQ Americans watched as the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in cases that could determine whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act offers them protection against discrimination, a position their own government -- expressed in a brief filed by the Justice Department -- opposes. By Thursday, the spotlight had shifted to a CNN Town Hall where nine Democratic presidential candidates offered up their approaches to ensuring fuller LGBTQ inclusion and empowerment.

Citing two people familiar with the inquiry, the paper builds on CNN's previous reporting on Thursday that Giuliani's financial dealings with two associates indicted on campaign finance-related charges were under scrutiny by investigators overseeing the case. Law enforcement officials briefed on the matter told CNN that the FBI and prosecutors in Manhattan are examining Giuliani's involvement in the broader flow of money that has become the focus of alleged violations that are at the center of the charges against Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman.

Both people familiar with the inquiry told the Times that the investigation into Giuliani was tied to that of Fruman and Parnas. One of the people told the Times that investigators are looking into Giuliani's attempts to subvert Marie Yovanovitch, the former American ambassador to Ukraine.

A spokeswoman for Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney in Manhattan, declined to comment to the Times.

Giuliani told the Times that he did not know of any investigations into him, and that he stood by his efforts in Ukraine as appropriate. He asserted that any alleged federal lobbying disclosure violations were baseless because his efforts to disseminate information on Yovanovitch were on behalf of Trump, not Ukrainian prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko.

The source did not provide additional details of the lunch. The New York Times first reported the meeting.

The Saturday meeting, in what appears to be a sign of solidarity between Trump and his lawyer, came at the end of a news-filled week in which questions swirled about whether Trump was cutting professional ties with Giuliani, who has been at the center of the impeachment inquiry into Trump headed by House Democrats . Most of those questions were because Trump initially refused to say if Giuliani was still his attorney and that he hoped Giuliani wouldn't be indicted.

On Friday, a source close to the President's legal team told CNN Giuliani is still the President's attorney but will not be dealing with matters involving Ukraine, and the Saturday lunch was evidence of their continued relationship.

In a Saturday morning tweet, Trump praised Giuliani, calling him a ""legendary 'crime buster' and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC."" He added that Giuliani is ""a great guy and wonderful lawyer."""

The campaign wrote:

They came from all 50 states, and nearly 20% of our donors gave to us for the first time this quarter. And most impressively, we did this while not fundraising during the 12 day period around the El Paso shooting because that tragedy wasn’t about our campaign, it was about our community.

However, O’Rourke’s team admitted that the amount raised is “not what we thought we’d be able to do given all of the other indicators we’re seeing.”

“Voters like what Beto has to say. When they meet him in person, they like him even more. In fact, our modeling shows a correlation between the counties Beto visits and an increase in his favorability,” his campaign argued.

The campaign diagnosed the problem, writing, “People think this is a two-person race.”

“We’re stuck in what we’ve been calling the ‘Media Trap,’ where the media is treating this race like it’s over, despite the fact that only 9% of voters have made up their mind,” it claimed, adding that it sees a “no-bullshit path for Beto.”

“We see a no-bullshit path for Beto and for our people-powered campaign—and a real, serious one,” his campaign wrote. “More than that, though, we see that we need to bypass the media trap and we need to do it quickly.”

The campaign outlined a few of the things that need to happen to help O’Rourke break through. The plan includes launching an advertising blitz, beefing up national organizers, and focusing on early primary states.

O’Rourke’s third-quarter haul pales in comparison to his competitors’ numbers:

During a rally in Lake Charles, Louisiana on Friday night, Trump slammed Democrats for failing to work with his administration to stop illegal immigration, and he thanked Mexico for its cooperation and putting troops on the Mexican side of the border.

Trump said:

On issue after issue, Democrats have put the needs of foreign citizens ahead of our own citizens. We protect borders of other countries, but we don’t protect our own borders. But I want to thank Mexico … 27,000 Mexican soldiers are on our border and you see the numbers, they plummeted … all because the Democrats wouldn’t approve simple changes to what we call the loopholes.

“So Mexico has helped us more at our border than the Democrats,” Trump said. “Honestly, they’re terrible.”

Trump said it is no wonder that foreign nationals flood the nation’s border when every leading 2020 Democrat — including Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — has promised to provide free, taxpayer-funded healthcare to all 11 to 22 million illegal aliens, a program that would cost anywhere between $23 to $66 billion every year.

Trump said”

And then you wonder why they come to America. Why wouldn’t they come? Free healthcare, free education, free everything … the Democrat vision of America is to rob American taxpayers to fund socialism for the entire world. If you don’t want Democrats to raid your healthcare, steal your money, overcrowd your schools, and overwhelm your communities, then you have only one choice, you have to go out tomorrow, vote Republican. Get John Bel Edwards the hell out of office.

As Breitbart News has reported, Trump has negotiated deals with Mexico to increase border controls on the Mexican side of the border to stop illegal aliens from crossing into the U.S. The most notable is Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy that ends the process by which border crossers are released into the interior of the country and instead returned to Mexico, preventing mass asylum fraud.

Elizabeth Warren and Facebook intensified over the weekend as Warren openly accused the company of ""taking money to promote lies.""",2019-10-13,CNN,Elizabeth Warren escalates Facebook ad feud,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/13/politics/elizabeth-warren-facebook-feud/index.html,"(CNN) A days-long feud between Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Facebook intensified over the weekend as Warren openly accused the company of ""taking money to promote lies.""

Warren, a leading Democratic 2020 candidate, has taken aim at the social media giant over its role in spreading disinformation against her and other candidates. Her campaign ran an ad on Facebook this past week that contained a deliberate lie to draw further attention to the issue.

That provocative move came after a recording leaked earlier this month of CEO Mark Zuckerberg telling employees that a Warren presidency would ""suck"" for the company.

Facebook fired back at Warren over the weekend via another social media platform, Twitter, where the company compared itself to broadcast television stations that ran the Trump ad and are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission.

The ""FCC doesn't want broadcast companies censoring candidates' speech,"" Facebook said in a tweet. ""We agree it's better to let voters -- not companies -- decide.""

The comparison opened the door to additional scrutiny of Facebook's role in handling political speech. Facebook declined to comment for this story.

In response, Warren said the company's decision to compare itself to heavily regulated broadcasters raised even more questions about how it should be managed.

""You're making my point here,"" she tweeted. ""It's up to you whether you take money to promote lies.""

The episode underscores how Facebook is trying to maintain its position as a neutral platform even as it acquires ever more influence over public discourse and information -- and as it seeks to address weaknesses that made it a vehicle for Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

Under current policy, Facebook exempts ads by politicians from third-party fact-checking -- a loophole, Warren says, that allows Zuckerberg to continue taking ""gobs of money"" from President Donald Trump's campaign despite Trump's ads telling untruths about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Trump's efforts to pursue unfounded claims about the Bidens are at the heart of the burgeoning impeachment inquiry facing the President.

The Warren fight over ads highlights the collapsing distinction between traditional broadcast media and 21st-century digital platforms, experts say, raising fresh questions about how decades-old regulations concerning political speech should apply to massive online platforms that can influence millions of voters.

And according to some legal analysts, it exposes the limits of Facebook's arguments that it is not a media company.

Beginning with the Radio Act of 1927, Congress mandated that radio stations, and later TV stations, cannot pick and choose which political candidates' ads to run.

Broadcasters may choose not to air political ads at all, though that is rare in today's media environment and the law still requires them to carry ads by federal candidates, said Harold Feld, senior vice president at the technology think tank Public Knowledge. But broadcasters that do accept political ads must air all advertisements from qualified candidates, without a view toward their truthfulness or accuracy.

Broadcasters can still decline to air political ads from non-candidates, such as political action committees. And none of these rules apply to cable networks, which is why CNN could legally decline to air the Trump ad.

Facebook's comparison to broadcasters raises difficult questions about whether it is appropriate to import rules meant for TV and radio stations to the internet, Feld said.

""We face the same choices that we had when radio and television were the big gatekeepers,"" he said. ""How much discretion do you want to give to these powerful shapers of public opinion while still being faithful to the principles of the First Amendment and letting the public decide?""

Broadcasters also obey a slew of other rules that companies such as Facebook do not, Feld said -- should Facebook have to comply with those as well?

For example, the government limits how many stations a media company may own in a particular market to limit anti-competitive behavior. Other FCC regulations require broadcasters to air a certain amount of children's programming, or to air sensitive content only after certain hours.

For a platform that targets content to users based on their interests and according to detailed data, reworking such rules for Facebook could be immensely complex and perhaps inadvisable, said Andrew Schwartzman, senior counselor to the Benton Foundation Institute for Broadband & Society, a civil society group.

""You can't apply that effectively, probably, to cable -- but certainly not to internet platforms,"" he said. ""It's just impossible.""

Facebook's reference to broadcasters also highlights a double standard. Schwartzman added that Facebook wants the benefit of the doubt afforded to regulated broadcasters, but ""without the responsibility of being a regulated broadcaster.""

Even those who have represented the broadcast industry say it is an odd and challenging position for Facebook to adopt.

""Facebook obviously doesn't want to be regulated like a broadcaster, so in a way it's strange they're citing this,"" said Jack Goodman, a former general counsel for the National Association of Broadcasters. ""Because they're not regulated, and they certainly don't want to be regulated.""

Warren's ads, which began running widely on Thursday, started with a bold but obvious falsehood: That Facebook and Zuckerberg had endorsed Trump's reelection campaign.

""You're probably shocked,"" read the ad, which reached tens of thousands of viewers nationwide. ""And you might be thinking, 'how could this possibly be true?' Well, it's not.""

On Saturday, Warren explained her ad was meant ""to see just how far"" the policy goes.

""We intentionally made a Facebook ad with false claims and submitted it to Facebook's ad platform to see if it'd be approved,"" she tweeted. ""It got approved quickly."""

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is causing him to rethink his decision to stay out of the presidential race, according to CNBC.

Bloomberg is reportedly mulling the possibility of entering the race – if Biden drops out – “according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were deemed private,” CNBC reported.

The former New York City mayor’s reconsideration has been ignited by Warren’s growing support over Biden.

Via CNBC:

Bloomberg has signaled he’s “still looking at” running for president, but people close him say that the only way he could even go down that path is if Biden’s fortunes suffer so much that he drops out before or during the early stages of the primary. Bloomberg could then enter the race as one of the rare moderates with enough name recognition and campaign funding to make a run. Forbes estimates his net worth at $51 billion, and he was planning to spend over $100 million on a campaign for president if he ran.

Bloomberg ruled out a presidential bid in March, telling supporters that he was “clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field.”

“While there would be no higher honor than serving as president, my highest obligation as a citizen is to help the country the best way I can, right now. That’s what I’ll do, including the launch of a new effort called Beyond Carbon,” he stated at the time.

Warren has positioned herself as a viable threat to Biden, who held the frontrunner status in the early months of the Democrat primary. The Massachusetts senator has surged in recent weeks, besting Biden in a number of national polls as well as early primary and caucus state polls. A YouGovUS/CBSNews poll released over the weekend showed Warren leading Biden in early states by six points– 31 percent to 25 percent:

Warren surpassed Biden in the Real Clear Politics average last week and currently sits less than two points behind Biden in the current average, with 26 percent to Biden’s 27.8.

Biden’s loss of his previously held frontrunner status has Bloomberg mulling a bid, although a source told CNBC that Bloomberg would not make a move unless Biden dropped out of the race.

“I think it’s something he wants. He has not been shy about that,” a Bloomberg ally told CNBC. “Nothing can happen unless Biden drops out, and that’s not happening anytime soon.”

“He’s like everyone else. They can’t get it out of their system,” another source, described as a banking executive, told CNBC.

“Bloomberg is in if Biden is out,” another source added.

The former mayor told the Associated Press this year that – if he ran for president – his campaign would focus on “climate change, education, and public health.”

“Climate change could destroy the whole world and kill everyone on it,” Bloomberg said. “It’s frustrating that a lot of people don’t understand that.”

The gun-control activist joined California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) in September, announcing the Satellites for Climate Action initiative, which is “dedicated to monitoring climate change and the impact of the state’s policies,” as Breitbart News reported."

1. More upheaval at Homeland Security

""He had actually been able to curb border crossings and implement some of the administration's harshest policies, but he never really developed a trust with the President,"" Washington Post White House reporter Josh Dawsey said.

""Immigration is the core issue of his presidency,"" Dawsey said. ""So he has to find the fifth person in three years to lead the agency that's really key to his reelection.""

2. Democrats move closer to obtaining Trump's taxes

Democrats are closer than ever to getting their hands on a copy of Trump's tax returns.

The DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Friday that Congress has every right to subpoena Trump's accounting firm for the returns as part of its oversight authority.

""The courts are starting to come to House Democrats' rescue,"" Washington Post congressional reporter Rachael Bade said. ""The problem for them is that the President of course is going to appeal this decision -- all of the decisions are going to end up in the Supreme Court, so it might not matter for now because they're going to keep dragging this out.""

Bade said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has suggested legislation that would require courts to move faster -- though it would have to pass the Republican-controlled Senate to become law.

3. A runoff in Louisiana

Bad news for Democrats in Saturday's Louisiana gubernatorial election.

Incumbent Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards failed to secure 50% of the vote against two Republicans who split the GOP vote -- which means now he's got a tougher one-on-one race with Republican Eddie Rispone.

""That makes his prospects much more difficult,"" Associated Press Washington Bureau Chief Julie Pace said, adding that it's a bad omen for the few Democratic elected officials left in the South.

""Edwards is the perfect profile for a Democrat in the deep South,"" Pace said. ""Another Democrat to watch in a similar circumstance is Alabama's Doug Jones, he's up for reelection next year. And Democrats need to hang on to that seat if they have any prospects of getting the Senate back. They have really, really tough prospects in the South.""

4. Warren on health care

But can the 2020 Democratic presidential contender get away with that line again at Tuesday's debate?

""I'm going to be looking out for how she responds to questions about Medicare for all,"" Wall Street Journal national political reporter Tarini Parti said. ""This is an issue her primary opponents have really been questioning her on, how she's going to pay for it.""

Parti said a source familiar with Warren's thinking told her they don't know yet what Medicare for All would cost, and so don't know yet what kind of revenue is needed to pay for it.

""So that's why they say she isn't responding to whether it's going to lead to an increase in taxes or not,"" Parti said. ""Different plans have different costs associated with them, so they're still trying to figure that part out.""

5. What's Gabbard's game?

And from CNN senior political reporter Nia-Malika Henderson:

While Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has said she is ""seriously considering"" boycotting Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate over what she says is a rigged process, our guess is that the Democratic presidential candidate will very likely be there in Ohio.

And if her July debate appearance is any guide, a few people on that stage should worry. Gabbard has proven to be a wild card in the Democratic primary, where she is polling at about 2%.

She got the best of California Sen. Kamala Harris in a previous debate, and Tuesday is a chance for a rematch. And for Gabbard it's also a chance to go after any number of other candidates -- like South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar -- as they vie to move up in the polls.

While those candidates look to make gains by going after candidates in the center of the stage, they might also want to be ready for what could come from the far ends of it, where some of the sharpest attacks have often been launched by candidates with little to lose."

Sign up here to receive it every weekday morning.

(CNN) Ever since Donald Trump became president, critics have worried that his rudimentary knowledge of global affairs, erratic decisions and politicized foreign policy would get people killed. It's happening now.

America's position has been incoherent so far. First Trump cleared the way for the Turkish assault by repositioning a small number of soldiers; now he's threatening sanctions against Ankara if it goes too far. Last week, he claimed the US had no soldiers left in Syria; this weekend, the administration vowed to withdraw 1,000 troops that are, in fact, still there.

The President is trading on a ""bring the troops home"" mentality that often follows US military entanglements overseas. It's a politically palatable position because the people dying as a result of his decisions are not American. His language is the tell here: He's using stereotypes about war-mongering Middle Easterners to undermine the idea that the Kurds could be real allies deserving of loyalty -- despite the successful, years-long US-Kurdish alliance against ISIS and before that in Iraq.

""(Turkey has fought) the Kurds for many years, for centuries,"" Trump said Saturday on Fox News. ""It's like some people go to lunch, that's what they do, they fight with the Kurds. It's time for us to leave.""

'They are coming and they will take everything. May God end America'

This was the despairing prediction of a Kurdish man trying to save his family from the Turkish advance, speaking to CNN's Nick Paton Walsh inside Syria.

'The ball in a pinball machine'

Over the weekend, Wall Street Journal columnist and former Ronald Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan summed up Trump's national security leadership like this: ""Foreign-policy decisions in this administration look like the ball in a pinball machine in some garish arcade with flashing lights and some frantic guy pushing the levers ping ping ping and thinking he's winning.""

Someone blinked

Finally, some good news. China and the United States seem to have stepped back from the brink with a trade war truce.

A deal reached last week could boost markets, cool Pacific tensions and perhaps offer a respite to the wobbling global economy -- if it actually happens. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have not yet signed it, and no draft has been released.

While Chinese state media was rather circumspect about the whole thing, Trump announced the deal in a tweet that seemed ripped from a 1970s Radio Moscow script: ""The deal I just made with China is, by far, the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our Great Patriot Farmers in the history of our Country,"" he wrote. He claims China has already started tens of billions of dollars in purchases of US agricultural produce.

But wait to read the fine print before popping open the baijiu. The President has hardly lived up to ""Art of the Deal"" self-mythologizing, and tends to over-sell such agreements. So far, there's no indication that the deal includes sweeping changes to China's economy and cuts to state industry subsidies that the US once demanded. And while Trump says Xi was desperate for a deal, he is the one facing reelection next year.

There's reason to suspect that Trump -- not Xi -- blinked first. But at least, for now, things are not getting worse.

Hong Kong protesters wearing masks of Chinese President Xi Jinping this weekend. Texas Senator Ted Cruz also visited the territory and condemned China's handling of the pro-democracy movement, CNN's Brad Lendon reports. ""The Chinese Communist government, I believe, is terrified of the protesters in the streets in Hong Kong,"" Cruz said.

In case you missed it, this Elizabeth Warren double-zinger wowed liberals after the Democratic 2020 candidate was asked how she'd respond to a constituent who opposed gay marriage at CNN's LGBT town hall last week. ""Then just marry one woman,"" she said, adding after a long pause: ""If you can find one."" But some Republican strategists say playing to the most socially liberal forces in the country could alienate conservative voters in the heartland.

Warren is not the only Democrat upping her zinger game ahead of Tuesday's debate -- unfortunately for Donald Trump Jr.

Hunter Biden says he'll undertake no ventures with foreign-owned business if his father Joe wins the White House. The former vice president's son made the announcement on Sunday . Trump has seized on Hunter's past dealings in Ukraine and China to accuse his potential 2020 opponent of corruption -- without evidence -- and the move looks like an attempt to defuse the issue before Tuesday's CNN Democratic debate in Ohio.

At an Iowa forum on Sunday, Biden responded with force to Trump's claims. ""No one -- no one -- has asserted my son did a single thing wrong,"" he said. ""No one has asserted that I have done anything wrong except the lying President.""

We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.

(CNN) This week was a kaleidoscope in Trump's Washington, a big picture moving and twisting -- tax records, subpoenas, arrests, foreign policy reversals -- stories reshaping, shifting, blending, it seemed, by the hour. Or, to borrow a different metaphor, a soap opera -- only a very serious one: ""Like sands through the hourglass, so are the days of our lives.""

The sand seemed to be slipping a lot faster for some. On Thursday, two associates of Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, were indicted. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were charged with campaign finance violations involving Ukraine. The indictment alleged that the two men enlisted the help of a sitting congressman to remove or recall the US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch), and posed the question everyone was asking: ""What does this mean for the Trump impeachment investigation?""

Short answer: we don't know yet. ""We know that both Parnas and Fruman helped Giuliani to try to dig up dirt on the Bidens. But the question of whether that relationship overlaps with criminal conduct is a mystery, for now,"" concluded Polisi. Giuliani's standing with President Trump was cast into sharp doubt on Friday, the same day that Yovanovitch testified behind closed doors on Capitol Hill, reportedly making explosive statements -- about Giuliani, his associates, Trump -- and lamenting a ""State Department attacked and hollowed out from within.""

Speaking of closing the book, Shepard Smith bid a surprise farewell to Fox News on Friday. With his announcement, Smith revealed something important about the state of conservative politics, said: there is little room for anyone who questions the status quo in most parts of the Republican universe.

Kathleen Parker in the Washington Post: ""No one who enters Trump's orbit leaves unscathed."" Pick your own metaphor for the impeachment inquiry, but it's a safe bet the kaleidoscope (and the hourglass too) will be getting a workout in the days ahead. put it well in the Washington Post: ""No one who enters Trump's orbit leaves unscathed.""

The art of creating a crisis

A number of commentators (and politicians, including among the GOP leadership) had strong words in response to Trump's decision, after a call Sunday with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to pull American forces out of northeastern Syria. Peter Bergen noted that the move essentially greenlighted a Turkish invasion ""that is exposing America's Kurdish allies to the wrath of the second-largest military in NATO"".

Bergen called Trump ""clueless,"" a master in the ""Art of Creating a Crisis,"" and drew a line connecting the commander in chief's mystifying Syria policy with equally confounding approaches to Iran, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan and North Korea.

Elliot Ackerman in the New York Times. Meanwhile, as CNN's Clarissa Ward No matter Trump's explanations for the move, it's ""difficult to see anything but abandonment"" of proven and loyal friends ""in the planned withdrawal,"" wrote in the New York Times. Meanwhile, as CNN's reported from northern Syria, Kurdish fighters said, ""The Americans sold us out"" -- and many expect to face the Turkish onslaught alone.

Jill Filipovic: ""(Trump's) broad impulse to bring American troops home is a good one. The tumultuous, ham-fisted and risky way he's going about it is not. And his own words indicate he is an unstable wannabe despot."" To her, None of this should come as a surprise, argued: ""(Trump's) broad impulse to bring American troops home is a good one. The tumultuous, ham-fisted and risky way he's going about it is not. And his own words indicate he is an unstable wannabe despot."" To her, what's shocking is that Trump has finally done something to elicit the public wrath of members of his own party -- notably Lindsey Graham, who called the Syria decision ""a stain on America's honor."" Filipovic zeroed in on the fissures in the Republican Party, asserting that they must be the start of something more: ""The GOP needs to offer more than words. We need action: Republicans, too, must demand that the President goes.""

Pursuing equality, living with whiplash

Samantha Allen, that many LGBTQ Americans -- watching their rights teeter on the judicial brink while under the political spotlight -- have whiplash.) On Tuesday, LGTBQ Americans watched as the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in cases that could determine whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act offers them protection against discrimination, a position their own government -- expressed in a brief filed by the Justice Department -- opposes. By Thursday, the spotlight had shifted to a CNN Town Hall where nine Democratic presidential candidates offered up their approaches to ensuring fuller LGBTQ inclusion and empowerment. ( It's no wonder , noted, that many LGBTQ Americans -- watching their rights teeter on the judicial brink while under the political spotlight -- have whiplash.)

LZ Granderson emphasized the importance not only of CNN's town hall but also of the protests that rose up in the hall from several trans women of color who felt their community deserved greater visibility. Granderson said both highlighted a critical point of progress in the fight for equality: the public assertion that for the LGBTQ community, the ""T"" is no longer silent.

Trump and Giuliani had lunch at President's golf course,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/13/politics/rudy-giuliani-donald-trump-lunch-meeting/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani on Saturday had lunch together at Trump's golf course in Sterling, Virginia, a person familiar with the meeting confirmed to CNN.

The source did not provide additional details of the lunch. The New York Times first reported the meeting.

The Saturday meeting, in what appears to be a sign of solidarity between Trump and his lawyer, came at the end of a news-filled week in which questions swirled about whether Trump was cutting professional ties with Giuliani, who has been at the center of the impeachment inquiry into Trump headed by House Democrats . Most of those questions were because Trump initially refused to say if Giuliani was still his attorney and that he hoped Giuliani wouldn't be indicted.

On Friday, a source close to the President's legal team told CNN Giuliani is still the President's attorney but will not be dealing with matters involving Ukraine, and the Saturday lunch was evidence of their continued relationship.

In a Saturday morning tweet, Trump praised Giuliani, calling him a ""legendary 'crime buster' and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC."" He added that Giuliani is ""a great guy and wonderful lawyer."""

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Monday commemorated “Indigenous Peoples’ Day” in place of Columbus Day and claimed America has a “long and painful” history of mistreating Native Americans.

The DC Council approved of the “Indigenous Peoples’ Day Emergency Declaration Act of 2019” last week, which temporarily replaces Columbus Day with “Indigenous Peoples’ Day” in the city this year. However, it is not a permanent measure:

Council member David Grosso said last week:

“Columbus Day was officially designated as a federal holiday in 1937, despite the fact Columbus did not discover North America, despite the fact millions of people were already living in North America upon his arrival to the Americas, and despite the fact Columbus never set foot on the shores of the current United States. … Columbus enslaved, colonized, mutilated, and massacred thousands of Indigenous People in the Americas.

Warren, who falsely claimed Native American heritage throughout her academic career, embraced the temporary replacement.

“The story of America’s mistreatment of indigenous peoples is long and painful. And yet, Native communities have proven resilient,” Warren wrote.

“We owe them our respect—and we must honor our government’s commitments and promises to them,” she added with the hashtag, “#IndigenousPeoplesDay”:

The story of America’s mistreatment of indigenous peoples is long and painful. And yet, Native communities have proven resilient. We owe them our respect—and we must honor our government's commitments and promises to them. #IndigenousPeoplesDay — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 14, 2019

Warren also provided a link to her extensive plan focused on “honoring and empowering tribal nations and Indigenous peoples”:

We must fulfill our trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations. We must protect Tribal sovereignty and self-determination. And we have to go even further to empower indigenous peoples to build stronger communities and a brighter future. https://t.co/WKMjPKTvDu — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 14, 2019

The presidential hopeful unveiled her comprehensive plan to “empower” tribal nations in August, which included key pieces from her other plans. She promised to expand federally protected land, sign a “set of executive orders to hold private contractors accountable for pay equity,” and provide Medicare for All.

Warren has faced scrutiny for falsely claiming Native American heritage in the past. The results of her DNA test made public last year showed that she possessed between 1/64th and 1/1,024 Native American ancestry (or between 0.1 percent to 1.56 percent). The results called her past claims of Native American heritage – Cherokee heritage, specifically – into question.

Not only had Warren identified as a minority professor for years, she also claimed Native American heritage on her Texas Bar registration card and once cited her high cheekbones as proof of her native roots. A clip of an interview from 2012 shows the presidential hopeful telling a reporter that she had pictures proving her Native American family history, but she refused to show them.

“I have plenty of pictures. They’re not for you,” Warren told the reporter:

As Breitbart News reported, Warren’s DNA results did not show a direct association with Native American tribes in the U.S., further debunking her claims of Cherokee heritage.

Warren has failed to explain why she went so many years claiming minority status without checking her family history, but she has since admitted that she is “not a citizen of a tribe” and issued a general apology for making what she described as a “mistake.”

“Like anyone who’s been honest with themselves, I know that I have made mistakes,” Warren said at the Native American Presidential Forum in Sioux City, Iowa, in August. “I am sorry for harm I have caused.”

Warren will join 11 other candidates on the debate stage at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, on Tuesday evening. The Massachusetts senator’s false claims of Native American heritage have yet to become a topic of conversation at any of the primary debates."

The remaining candidates fell below the well-established top tier. The survey shows Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) down by double digits, with seven percent support. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) came in fifth place with five percent support, and former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D) came in right behind with four percent support.

Cory Booker (D-NJ) recently sat down with NPR and discussed his struggle connecting with black voters in America, a struggle he denied.

Booker’s comments were made during an episode of NPR’s “Off Script,” where a conversation between Booker and two voters was moderated by Ari Shapiro.

“When we talk about the presidential candidacy, a lot of times they say they don’t feel like you are the voice — the black voice — for the black youth,” said education advocate Shanell Dunns. “How do you respond to not being able to connect to that demographic of youth?”

Booker quipped back, denying the claim that many black voters do not see him as “the black voice” for black youth.

“Well, No. 1: I think we actually do connect to it. Some of our biggest support is from HBCUs to African American young people who are big activists for our campaign. It’s one of the groups we do very well in,” Booker said.

A recent poll showed Booker trailing several Democrat presidential hopefuls in regards to support from black voters. Those who outrank Booker with support from black voters include former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

Booker went on to note his work with the First Step Act.

“So let my work speak for me,” Booker said. “In the United States Senate, I’ve pushed more than a dozen bills on these issues that span from police accountability all the way to the bill that I actually got passed … the First Step Act, which has already led to the liberation of thousands of people, overwhelmingly black and Latino people.”

Shapiro then pressed Booker on his record as Newark mayor from 2006 until 2013, specifically the Justice Department’s investigation into the city’s police force, which received “serious allegations of civil rights violations.”

“I inherited the police department with decades-long problems and patterns and practices,” Booker claimed as he responded to Shapiro.

Booker also stated his administration made “tremendous strides” to correct problems within the police force.

“At first I was like, ‘Why do I need the DOJ?’ But when they presented us with the data, we saw that we were not moving fast enough to correct the problems,” he added."

The focus group — convened by Axios and Engagious/FPG last week — showed that swing voters are “expressing a range of unease” about impeaching President Trump, according to an Axios report.

The fears range from impeaching hurting the economy to frustrations that House Democrats are most invested in going after Trump than in helping people, said the report.

The participants said impeachment made them feel “concerned,” “uneasy,” “exhausted,” “sad that they’re [Democrats] so focused on it,” and “a big distraction from what we could be doing.”

Axios noted that the findings are a counterpoint to recent national polls, including the Fox News poll, that showed that more Americans favor impeaching and removing Trump.

On “why it matters,” Axios explained, “If such sentiments last and play out on a larger scale across pivotal states, it spells trouble for Democrats unless they can reframe what they’re trying to accomplish.”

Brad P., a 40-year-old Trump voter, called impeachment “a never-ending drama” that “shows to me these people are completely out of touch with everyday Americans’ lives.”

Two people doubted that Trump asked Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, and others did not think it warrants impeachment if he did. “Is there undeniable proof?” asked one man.

Participants similarly had negative things to say about the Democrats.

“They need to focus on the real issues,” said Judy D., a 60-year-old Trump voter, said. “[Nancy] Pelosi hates him so bad, I just think she needs to drop it and worry about the country.”

Deborah G., a 56-year-old Clinton voter, said, “They need to be concentrating on the country, not what he’s doing wrong,”

Eric B., a 34-year-old Trump voter, said, “They hit a big strike on Mueller, so this is trying to get another base hit on the president.”

Richelle W., a 40-year-old Trump voter, said, “It’s become more of … ‘Destroy the other party’ instead of build the whole country up.”

Rocco P., a 40-year-old Trump voter, offered this advice to Democrats, saying, “Just drop it. Beat Trump at the ballot box.”

Lisa A., who was a Clinton voter, didn’t think impeachment was a great idea, but said, “I believe in the checks and balances,” and “I’m not scared of the process.”

The focus group was held in Mahoning Country, which Trump lost by less than 4,000 votes. Eight of the focus group participants swung from Barack Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016, and three switched from Mitt Romney to Hillary Clinton.

Six of the 11 participants say they have made up their minds for 2020 — four of the participants said they will definitely vote for Trump again, one former Trump voter said he will vote for Andrew Yang, and one Clinton voter, Lisa A., said she’s leaning toward Elizabeth Warren.

Five are undecided.

“While a focus group is not a statistically significant sample like a poll, these responses show how some voters are thinking and talking about the 2020 election in crucial counties,” Axios’s report said.

The people familiar told the paper that witnesses have been questioned by investigators since at least August about Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal lawyer.

Part of the questioning involves any potential role Giuliani played in an alleged conspiracy involving two of his business associates , Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were indicted on campaign finance-related charges last week.

The Journal's report builds on reporting from The New York Times l ast week that Giuliani is facing an investigation by federal prosecutors into whether his involvement with Ukraine violated federal lobbying laws.

Giuliani told CNN on Monday that he was unsure if prosecutors were looking into his work with the mayor of Kharkiv, with whom he had met on a December 2017 trip as part of his international consulting business.

""It was a security report focusing on an emergency management center which was concluded in (December) or so 2017. I have no knowledge they are looking at it but let them. Maybe they should ask me instead of leaking it (if they are doing it) and I can save them unnecessary work,"" Giuliani said.

When asked if he was aware of prosecutors looking into any other area of his Ukraine business dealings, Giuliani told CNN, ""No l don't think they are but my bank records are fine.""

The former New York mayor has faced a wave of scrutiny following the release of a whistleblower complaint that alleges Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the 2020 election and that the White House took steps to cover it up. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

The whistleblower complaint labels Giuliani a ""central figure"" in the controversy.

US officials were concerned, the whistleblower said, with Giuliani and his contacts with Ukrainian officials. The whistleblower alleges that US officials believed Giuliani was a conduit for messages between the President and officials in Kiev and that he was at the helm of a problematic ""circumvention of national security decision making processes.""

Giuliani has previously told CNN he has ""no knowledge of any of that crap"" in the complaint."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is causing him to rethink his decision to stay out of the presidential race, according to CNBC.

Bloomberg is reportedly mulling the possibility of entering the race – if Biden drops out – “according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were deemed private,” CNBC reported.

The former New York City mayor’s reconsideration has been ignited by Warren’s growing support over Biden.

Via CNBC:

Bloomberg has signaled he’s “still looking at” running for president, but people close him say that the only way he could even go down that path is if Biden’s fortunes suffer so much that he drops out before or during the early stages of the primary. Bloomberg could then enter the race as one of the rare moderates with enough name recognition and campaign funding to make a run. Forbes estimates his net worth at $51 billion, and he was planning to spend over $100 million on a campaign for president if he ran.

Bloomberg ruled out a presidential bid in March, telling supporters that he was “clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field.”

“While there would be no higher honor than serving as president, my highest obligation as a citizen is to help the country the best way I can, right now. That’s what I’ll do, including the launch of a new effort called Beyond Carbon,” he stated at the time.

Warren has positioned herself as a viable threat to Biden, who held the frontrunner status in the early months of the Democrat primary. The Massachusetts senator has surged in recent weeks, besting Biden in a number of national polls as well as early primary and caucus state polls. A YouGovUS/CBSNews poll released over the weekend showed Warren leading Biden in early states by six points– 31 percent to 25 percent:

“I think it’s something he wants. He has not been shy about that,” a Bloomberg ally told CNBC. “Nothing can happen unless Biden drops out, and that’s not happening anytime soon.”

“He’s like everyone else. They can’t get it out of their system,” another source, described as a banking executive, told CNBC.

“Bloomberg is in if Biden is out,” another source added.

The former mayor told the Associated Press this year that – if he ran for president – his campaign would focus on “climate change, education, and public health.”

“Climate change could destroy the whole world and kill everyone on it,” Bloomberg said. “It’s frustrating that a lot of people don’t understand that.”

The gun-control activist joined California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) in September, announcing the Satellites for Climate Action initiative, which is “dedicated to monitoring climate change and the impact of the state’s policies,” as Breitbart News reported."

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont by name for their support of ""Medicare for All.""

The ad -- titled ""Makes More Sense"" -- highlights Buttigieg's Medicare for All Who Want It health care plan, a middle-of-the-road approach that would not force people onto government health coverage but would offer a public option for people who choose to enroll. That is a key distinction between Buttigieg's plan and the sweeping overhaul that would be instituted under a full Medicare for All program.

The ad represents an escalation by the South Bend, Indiana, mayor's campaign, after he's mostly kept his Medicare for All critiques nameless and primarily focused on policy.

Buttigieg's ad uses reporters and media figures to describe the differences between the plans, including CNN political commentator Joe Lockhart saying, ""Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren believe that we have to force ourselves into Medicare for all, where private insurance is abolished.""

His campaign said in a news release, ""The ad highlights Pete's bold approach to health care would not kick millions of people off their private health care, and would give them the option to choose the plan that's right for their them.""

Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday challenged her Democratic primary rivals to release the names of contributors and fundraisers with influential positions on their campaigns, while pledging to champion legislation that would effectively disqualify big-dollar donors from being appointed to cushy diplomatic posts.

The requests were written into a series of mostly new proposed campaign finance restrictions, which would ban corporate PACs from donating to federal candidates and make it illegal for certain super PACs to be run by operatives with professional or personal ties to the candidate they're backing.

Now firmly among the front-runners for the Democratic presidential nomination, Warren has increasingly centered her campaign on a broad anti-corruption platform . In past rollouts, she promised to forbid lobbyists from making political contributions, acting as bundlers or hosting fundraisers for candidates. Former top federal officials -- including presidents, vice presidents, members of Congress, judges, and cabinet secretaries -- would also be permanently prohibited from taking lobbying jobs.

While Warren does not name any of her competitors in her Medium post, the new call for campaigns to ""disclose any donor or fundraiser who has a special title on their campaign, including national and regional finance committee members and bundler designations"" is an apparent nudge to a number of top rivals, like former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris, who all regularly attend big-dollar fundraising events.

Warren's call to cut off the donor-to-ambassador pipeline, which she acknowledges has been common practice in both Republican and Democratic administrations, comes with increased resonance now that President Donald Trump's EU ambassador, Gordon Sondland , a Republican megadonor who gave $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee, has emerged as a key figure in the Ukraine scandal.

It was a rough-and-tumble welcome in the arena for a candidate who has gamely sidestepped attacks in previous debates. But at the CNN/New York Times debate Tuesday night in the crucial swing state of Ohio, the Massachusetts senator was constantly on defense driving her central argument that Democrats must ""dream big"" and ""fight hard."" All the fire sent in Warren's direction at Otterbein University underscored a marked shift in the Democratic race that has been underway for many weeks: while former Vice President Joe Biden has remained strong in the polls, the other candidates in the race clearly now see Warren as the real competition.

It was one of the first times Warren had to face a barrage of critiques from her Democratic competitors, navigating many of the critical comments usually aimed toward Biden or Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

It was the moderates in the race who targeted the newly minted front-runner the most. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg set that aggressive tone from the opening moments of the debate as he sought to seize the centrist lane within the Democratic field. Challenging Warren on her refusal to answer a yes-or-no questions about whether her plan would lead to tax hikes from the middle class, he said her evasiveness embodied the very reason why Americans are so frustrated with Washington.

""Your signature is to have a plan for everything, except this,"" Buttigieg said to Warren. ""No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this plan that Sen. Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.""

In a strong performance, Buttigieg repeatedly argued that Democrats would not be able to sell some of Warren's more liberal ideas -- namely ""Medicare for All"" -- to the broader universe of voters that the party must sway to win the White House.

""I don't understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage is to obliterate private plans,"" Buttigieg said to Warren. ""We're competing to be president for the day after Trump. Our country will be polarized, more than now. After everything we have been through, after everything we are about to go through, this country will be more divided. Why divide this country over health care when there's a better way to deliver coverage for all?""

Warren did not back down, but at times seemed surprised by the force of the attacks against her -- even from the normally mild-mannered former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke who accused her of embracing a philosophy that was punitive.

""Look, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,"" she said.

Buttigieg's arguments were often amplified by Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who also leaned heavily on her Midwestern roots to argue that Warren and Sanders have driven the party too far to the left. In one tense exchange, the Minnesota senator referred to ""Medicare for All"" -- a proposal that was crafted by Sanders and endorsed by Warren -- as a ""pipe-dream.""

""The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done,"" Klobuchar said.

""At least Bernie is being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this -- and that taxes are going to go up,"" she added. ""We owe it to the American people to tell them where we will send the invoice.""

At another point Warren was repeatedly badgered by California Sen. Kamala Harris, who tried to force her into agreeing with Harris's proposal that Trump should be thrown off Twitter. It was then that Warren showed a touch of exasperation.

""Look, I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter, I want to push him out of the White House,"" Warren said.

Biden touts record, Sanders thanks well-wishers

While he often receded into the background on Tuesday night, Biden argued that he had done bigger things than anyone else on stage, citing the Violence Against Women Act as one example.

Though he did not take on Warren as aggressively as some of the others, he tried at one point to take credit for getting the votes in Congress to make her idea for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau a reality. ""I got votes for that bill,"" Biden said, referring to the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act that established the bureau. ""I convinced people to vote for it, so let's get those things straight too,"" he said.

Pushing back on that idea, Warren offered her thanks to Biden's then-boss, President Barack Obama and everyone else who helped create the agency -- pointedly not mentioning the former vice president.

""I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law,"" Warren said.

Biden, grinning as he stood beside her, graciously offered a compliment: ""You did a hell of a job in your job,"" he said to her.

""Thank you,"" she replied.

When the conversation turned to the age of the three leading candidates -- Biden, Sanders and Warren -- who are all in their 70s, Biden also sought to frame his age as an asset. He promised to release his health records, along with some two decades of his tax information.

""Look, one of the reasons I'm running is because of my age and my experience,"" Biden said. ""With it comes wisdom. We need someone to take office this time around who on day one can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders from Putin to our allies, and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track.""

Sanders, who was back on the trail for the first time since his heart attack, tried to allay any concerns about his stamina by stating that he's ""healthy"" and ""feeling great."" The 78-year-old also offered his thanks for the well wishes he has received over the past two weeks.

""Let me take this moment if I might to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes,"" he said. ""And I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and I'm so happy to be back here with you this evening.""

Gabbard spars with Buttigieg

Facing the Democratic Party's increasingly difficult threshold to make the next debate in Georgia, some of the lower tier candidates clearly knew that they needed to generate a jolt of energy for their campaigns on Tuesday night. But the only candidate at that level who drew notice was Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii.

Gabbard, an Iraq War veteran who served in the Army, has called for US troops to leave Syria and she sparred with Buttigieg -- the only other veteran on the stage -- over US engagement in that conflict.

The Hawaii congresswoman criticized Trump's sudden decision to abandon Kurdish forces near the northern Syrian border -- a move that essentially opened the door for a Turkish military offensive against the longtime US allies. She described the ""slaughter of Kurds"" by Turkey as a consequence of ""the regime-change war that we've been waging in Syria.""

""Donald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hands -- but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime-change war in Syria that started in 2011,"" Gabbard said, ""along with many in the mainstream media, who have been championing and cheerleading this regime-change war.""

Buttigieg, who served in the Navy Reserve, told Gabbard she was ""dead wrong.""

""The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this President of American allies and American values,"" Buttigieg said.

He noted that he did not support going into Iraq and believes that the US should get out of Afghanistan, but said it was also the case that ""a small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we're seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS.""

""When I was deployed I knew one of the things keeping me safe was the flag on my shoulder represented a country that kept its word,"" Buttigieg said. ""You take that away, it takes away what makes America America."""

Sign up here to receive it every weekday morning.

(CNN) Ever since Donald Trump became president, critics have worried that his rudimentary knowledge of global affairs, erratic decisions and politicized foreign policy would get people killed. It's happening now.

America's position has been incoherent so far. First Trump cleared the way for the Turkish assault by repositioning a small number of soldiers; now he's threatening sanctions against Ankara if it goes too far. Last week, he claimed the US had no soldiers left in Syria; this weekend, the administration vowed to withdraw 1,000 troops that are, in fact, still there.

The President is trading on a ""bring the troops home"" mentality that often follows US military entanglements overseas. It's a politically palatable position because the people dying as a result of his decisions are not American. His language is the tell here: He's using stereotypes about war-mongering Middle Easterners to undermine the idea that the Kurds could be real allies deserving of loyalty -- despite the successful, years-long US-Kurdish alliance against ISIS and before that in Iraq.

""(Turkey has fought) the Kurds for many years, for centuries,"" Trump said Saturday on Fox News. ""It's like some people go to lunch, that's what they do, they fight with the Kurds. It's time for us to leave.""

'They are coming and they will take everything. May God end America'

This was the despairing prediction of a Kurdish man trying to save his family from the Turkish advance, speaking to CNN's Nick Paton Walsh inside Syria.

'The ball in a pinball machine'

Over the weekend, Wall Street Journal columnist and former Ronald Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan summed up Trump's national security leadership like this: ""Foreign-policy decisions in this administration look like the ball in a pinball machine in some garish arcade with flashing lights and some frantic guy pushing the levers ping ping ping and thinking he's winning.""

Someone blinked

Finally, some good news. China and the United States seem to have stepped back from the brink with a trade war truce.

A deal reached last week could boost markets, cool Pacific tensions and perhaps offer a respite to the wobbling global economy -- if it actually happens. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have not yet signed it, and no draft has been released.

While Chinese state media was rather circumspect about the whole thing, Trump announced the deal in a tweet that seemed ripped from a 1970s Radio Moscow script: ""The deal I just made with China is, by far, the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our Great Patriot Farmers in the history of our Country,"" he wrote. He claims China has already started tens of billions of dollars in purchases of US agricultural produce.

But wait to read the fine print before popping open the baijiu. The President has hardly lived up to ""Art of the Deal"" self-mythologizing, and tends to over-sell such agreements. So far, there's no indication that the deal includes sweeping changes to China's economy and cuts to state industry subsidies that the US once demanded. And while Trump says Xi was desperate for a deal, he is the one facing reelection next year.

There's reason to suspect that Trump -- not Xi -- blinked first. But at least, for now, things are not getting worse.

Texas Senator Ted Cruz also visited the territory and condemned China's handling of the pro-democracy movement, CNN's Brad Lendon reports.

He won 80 of 88 counties here, including nine that voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. His narrowest victory among those nine came in here in Montgomery County outside of Dayton, where he eked out a win with less than a percentage point.

But on the eve of Tuesday's CNN/New York Times debate at Otterbein University, interviews with voters in this swing county suggest signs of electoral trouble for the commander in chief. Though Trump's approval rating has been relatively steady nationally, in nearly two-dozen interviews, voters here -- particularly independents -- expressed growing unease about Trump's actions, from his attempt to enlist help from Ukraine's president to investigate his political rival to his abrupt decision to abandon a key US ally in Syria , stunning leaders of his own party.

Melissa Curran, a 43-year-old independent from here in Huber Heights, was incredulous about the President's request for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.

""Why is he going outside the US to do that? If he's got accusations, we have a criminal system here that he should have trusted,"" she said. ""But he's fired so many people here who didn't do what he wanted that I feel like we don't have a voice anymore.""

At the same time, voters feeling that agitation about Trump said they weren't sure yet whether Democratic calls for impeachment are warranted. They were often quick to say they want to see more facts about whether the President did, in fact, pressure Ukraine to investigate 2020 rival Joe Biden and Biden's son Hunter. (There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.)

Notably, the sense of uncertainty for Trump in Ohio isn't grounded in excitement about his Democratic rivals, but rather from eroding confidence in the president's decision-making, and palpable disgust felt by female suburban voters like Curran, who has begun to believe that Trump is seeking absolute power.

Curran didn't vote for Trump or Hillary Clinton in 2016 because she wasn't motivated by either of them. But she now wants him out of the White House, even though she believes he's done some ""positive things"" on the economy.

""If he would calm himself and humble himself, he could have been a great president, but the way he handles his business breaks my heart,"" Curran told CNN.

She pointed to Trump's shutdown over the federal government over border wall funding last December as an example of what she sees as his thirst for total control.

""Shutting down the government because he wanted to stomp his feet over this wall, I mean this is an Air Force town -- so many people were affected by his tantrum,"" said Curran, comparing his behavior to that of an ""errant child.""

Curran plans to vote against Trump at the ballot box in 2020, but she is looking to the Democrats to lay out more facts on exactly what Trump's intentions were with Ukraine: ""Words are words. Impeaching somebody for their thoughts? Everybody in this world would be out if we just did it for our thoughts. I want to see the facts.""

""But would I re-elect him? Absolutely not,"" she added. ""No matter what, I will not put him back in office. I feel like he's going to destroy this country bit by bit.""

Burden of proof

Recent national polling has shown something close to an even split among Americans on whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office. In a CNN poll in late September poll, after the House announced a formal inquiry, 47% of Americans supported those moves, up from 41% in May. The change over that time period was driven largely by independents and Republicans. Support for impeachment and removal among independents, who will be key to Trump's chances of re-election, rose by 11 points. Among Republicans, it increased by 8 points.

It is not yet clear whether the release of the White House transcript of his call with Ukraine President Volodomyr Zelensky will be the tipping point in his presidency -- or simply one more strike against him in a series of decisions that swing voters find troubling. But clearly the President himself has been dismayed by the poll numbers, lashing out on Twitter at Fox News after its new poll last week showed 51% of registered voters want him impeached and removed; and 51% also said his administration is more corrupt than previous administrations.

Interviews with voters here in Ohio largely reflected the uncertainty about impeachment nationally. While the Ukraine controversy pushed some over the edge toward impeachment, interviews here suggest that Democrats have not convincingly made the case to other voters that Trump's Ukraine call is significantly different than the murky findings of the Russia investigation by former special counsel Robert Mueller.

The uproar around the Russia investigation went on for so long that Republican-leaning-independent Tim Sartori said he just started to tune it all out.

""From the jump, it seems like people have been on him -- it's like they're on a witch hunt,"" said Sartori, a 55-year-old salesman, recalling the phrase that Trump repeatedly used to describe the Russia probe. ""He's cocky and he's arrogant, but I'm not sure if this is more of the same,"" he said of the Ukraine matter. He noted that, in his view, the Russia investigation yielded scant evidence of wrongdoing by Trump.

Sartori said he's withholding judgment for now on impeachment.

""If the facts come out that he did something he shouldn't have done, then yeah, my attitude would change on him, but right now it seems like they're reaching,"" he said. ""To be honest, I heard about (the Ukraine call), but I don't know exactly what he said.""

""I want to wait for the facts,"" Sartori said. ""If they actually get something, if it's something that he did that he should be impeached for, then he should be impeached.""

That doesn't mean, however, that Sartori is keen on pulling the lever for one of the Democrats to be the next president: ""There's nobody I've seen who lights me on fire.""

Republican Wayne Furay, a 58-year-old bailiff from nearby Xenia (in neighboring Greene County, which Trump won) said he too is trying to sort through the Ukraine controversy and undecided about which way he'll go in 2020.

He's struggling with his reservations about Trump's judgment and his dislike for Democrats' negativity toward the president, along with the Democratic Party's shift to the left.

Trump's request to Ukraine for help investigating the Bidens ""was probably a bad move,"" Furay said. ""But I don't think it's cause for that,"" he said of impeachment. ""Everything from the start has been noise.""

""I don't like his demeanor. He says what he thinks, but he's not very couth,"" Furay said of Trump. ""But it seems like kind of a witch hunt. They look for everything he does wrong, and it's been like that from the beginning.... I don't really like him that much, but I don't really like any of the other ones, either.""

Lester Settlage, an 83-year-old retired farmer who voted for Trump, also expressed confusion about the interactions between Trump and Ukraine. Asked whether Trump deserves reelection, he gave the President high marks on the economy.

""I mean if you measure it by the stock market, the economy is booming. Look around,"" Settlage said, gesturing to a packed parking lot outside Target in Montgomery County. ""Look at all the cars here that are less than 3 years old.""

Thus far in the Ukraine investigation, Settlage doesn't trust the motives of Democrats.

""I don't know how to feel about it,"" he said of Trump's call with Ukraine, ""because I'm not exactly sure what Ukraine knows. But Ukraine is an independent country. It's no longer with Russia,"" he said. ""So what's all the hullabaloo about? ... Let's get some policy work done.""

For voters who have paid closer attention to the President's actions -- and his words on the call -- like Frederic Scheffler, an 83-year-old Republican from Centerville, Ohio, the Ukraine matter is yet another troubling development in string of erratic decisions that have raised questions about whether Trump has sound judgment.

Three years after voting for Trump, he's considering voting for a Democrat in 2020—a surprise even to him.

Scheffler said Trump's unpredictable and sometimes inexplicable actions have unnerved him, from Ukraine to Trump's decision to pull back US troops in Syria , leaving longtime allies open to attack.

""He seems to be doing things independently without Congress. It's disturbing,"" said Scheffler.

Like other voters, he wants to see more facts about the President's intentions in his dealings with Ukraine.

""If they can prove that he put pressure on Ukraine that would be one thing,"" Scheffler said. But he doesn't think impeachment would be good for the country -- and notes that the President of Ukraine said there was no quid pro quo in his discussions with Trump.

For now, he'd rather register his disapproval at the polls next year. Unless the nominee is Elizabeth Warren, whose ideas he describes as expensive and ""way out left.""

""It would have to be a moderate, not someone who's way out there,"" he said. ""But who's moderate?"""

Sign up here to receive it every weekday morning.

(CNN) President Donald Trump has a nose for weakness. And Joe Biden's softest spot is his near-mystical reverence for family.

Nothing is likely to cause Biden more pain, to test his cool and to force him into an error more than an attack on his kin. The former vice president can barely get through a sentence without a poignant reference to his late parents, his second wife, Jill, his children or his grandchildren. In a life scarred by tragedy, he has already buried two of his kids and a first wife. Grief over the death of his eldest son, Beau, from brain cancer nixed a run for president in 2016.

So Trump has plunged his 2020 election dagger into Biden's second son, targeting Hunter Biden with unsubstantiated allegations about his business dealings in Ukraine and China. Going after family is one of his preferred tricks: In the 2016 presidential race, Trump mocked the Bush dynasty, knowing it would unhinge its scion Jeb. He upset Ted Cruz by insulting his wife, and raised Bill Clinton's affairs while debating Hillary Clinton (though eliciting only a slow blink).

Yet, with little sense of irony, Trump resents attacks on his own clan (and has shown flagrant disregard for potential conflicts of interest in his own sons' business ventures. As is often the case with leaders with an authoritarian streak, his kids -- kept close in the White House and in Trump's businesses -- are the only ones who can offer the loyalty he craves.

Trump signaled to then-special counsel Robert Mueller that probing his family accounts would cross a red line. But there are no such lines when the President himself perceives an enemy.

Postcard from Kiev

Demonstrators light smoke flares as they march in central Kiev.

About 20,000 people marched in a nationalist rally in Kiev, with many calling on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky not to move forward on a peace deal with Russia-backed separatists in the country's east.

""The protesters marched in groups. We saw regular soldiers, veterans and nationalist groups. Some had their faces covered and wore all black. Most striking was the diversity of ages -- we saw teenagers right up to pensioners,"" writes CNN's Sebastian Shukla to Meanwhile from Kiev.

""Flares were lit and chants such as 'Death to the enemy' and 'Glory to Ukraine' were shouted by the entire contingent. Protesters marched down to Maidan Square and the Presidential Administration, where they covered the building in stickers saying 'No to capitulation' -- a clear reference to Zelensky's recent move to form a peace deal in the east.""

'A strategic calamity'

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took the rare step of openly breaking with Trump over a key policy issue. ""I am gravely concerned by recent events in Syria and by our nation's apparent response thus far,"" the Kentucky Republican said. ""I look forward to discussing what the United States can do to avoid a strategic calamity with my Senate colleagues and with senior administration officials.""

Syria, in brief

Kurds in northern Syria are gambling with their autonomy by turning to Russia and the Syrian government for protection after Trump withdrew US troops. Now the White House is trying to cover its blushes after the President's strategy was panned as a foreign policy disaster at home and abroad. Here's the latest, in brief:

The Syrian Kurdish governing coalition said it would sign a ""memorandum of understanding"" with Moscow, in an attempt to ""prevent the Turkish attack.""

Syrian President Bashar Assad's army entered several cities in the area, according to state media -- part of a deal with the Kurds to enforce the border with Turkey.

Turkey accused the Kurds of deliberately releasing ISIS prisoners. Trump soon echoed that claim -- but a senior US official told CNN that's just not true.

Trump announced new sanctions on Turkey over an incursion for which he cleared the way last week, warning that its ""action is precipitating a humanitarian crisis and setting conditions for possible war crimes.""

Vice President Mike Pence said he would travel to Turkey to push for a ceasefire between groups in the area.

In a press briefing about US sanctions on Turkey, Vice President Mike Pence told reporters that Trump had spoken to both Kurdish General Mazloum Kobani Abdi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and CNN got a look at his notes in the process.

Democrats debate

The CNN/New York Times presidential debate tonight in Ohio will be the most pivotal moment yet in the Democratic race. The clash among 12 candidates will highlight growing vulnerabilities among front-runners and offer outsiders one of a dwindling number of chances to break through. Here's what each major candidate must do:

Joe Biden must make sure his debate is not overshadowed by Trump's unsubstantiated claims about his son's financial dealings. He has fiercely rebutted any suggestion of impropriety, and his Democratic rivals have defended him so far. But they may not be above wondering why Hunter Biden risked conflicts of interest by doing business abroad while his father was vice president.

Bernie Sanders is desperate for a strong showing after a heart attack raised questions about his age and health. The 78-year-old senator from Vermont was already in danger of losing the battle for the party's progressive left. He can't afford to slip.

Elizabeth Warren has overtaken Sanders and is now considered a co-front-runner with Biden. That means she's got a target on her back. The liberal senator from Massachusetts bills herself as the candidate with a plan for anything, but expect her rivals to attack her glaringly unspecific position on a top issue: health care.

Pete Buttigieg's quietly impressive campaign and bumper fundraising could set him up for a possible late surge into the first contest in Iowa. But he must disprove impressions that -- as the 37-year-old mayor of a small Indiana city -- he lacks the experience to be president.

Kamala Harris needs something to happen. Soon. A campaign that started with great promise has sputtered, partly due to the California senator's shaky grasp of her own policies. Time is running out for a leap into the top tier.

Everyone else -- including Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Obama administration Cabinet Secretary Julián Castro and former Congressman Beto O'Rourke of Texas -- simply must give voters a reason to care. Some of them are already in danger of falling short of the stricter criteria for the next debate, in November.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Monday commemorated “Indigenous Peoples’ Day” in place of Columbus Day and claimed America has a “long and painful” history of mistreating Native Americans.

The DC Council approved of the “Indigenous Peoples’ Day Emergency Declaration Act of 2019” last week, which temporarily replaces Columbus Day with “Indigenous Peoples’ Day” in the city this year. However, it is not a permanent measure:

Council member David Grosso said last week:

“Columbus Day was officially designated as a federal holiday in 1937, despite the fact Columbus did not discover North America, despite the fact millions of people were already living in North America upon his arrival to the Americas, and despite the fact Columbus never set foot on the shores of the current United States. … Columbus enslaved, colonized, mutilated, and massacred thousands of Indigenous People in the Americas.

Warren, who falsely claimed Native American heritage throughout her academic career, embraced the temporary replacement.

“The story of America’s mistreatment of indigenous peoples is long and painful. And yet, Native communities have proven resilient,” Warren wrote.

“We owe them our respect—and we must honor our government’s commitments and promises to them,” she added with the hashtag, “#IndigenousPeoplesDay”:

Warren also provided a link to her extensive plan focused on “honoring and empowering tribal nations and Indigenous peoples”:

We must fulfill our trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations. We must protect Tribal sovereignty and self-determination. And we have to go even further to empower indigenous peoples to build stronger communities and a brighter future. https://t.co/WKMjPKTvDu — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 14, 2019

The presidential hopeful unveiled her comprehensive plan to “empower” tribal nations in August, which included key pieces from her other plans. She promised to expand federally protected land, sign a “set of executive orders to hold private contractors accountable for pay equity,” and provide Medicare for All.

Warren has faced scrutiny for falsely claiming Native American heritage in the past. The results of her DNA test made public last year showed that she possessed between 1/64th and 1/1,024 Native American ancestry (or between 0.1 percent to 1.56 percent). The results called her past claims of Native American heritage – Cherokee heritage, specifically – into question.

Not only had Warren identified as a minority professor for years, she also claimed Native American heritage on her Texas Bar registration card and once cited her high cheekbones as proof of her native roots. A clip of an interview from 2012 shows the presidential hopeful telling a reporter that she had pictures proving her Native American family history, but she refused to show them.

“I have plenty of pictures. They’re not for you,” Warren told the reporter:

As Breitbart News reported, Warren’s DNA results did not show a direct association with Native American tribes in the U.S., further debunking her claims of Cherokee heritage.

Warren has failed to explain why she went so many years claiming minority status without checking her family history, but she has since admitted that she is “not a citizen of a tribe” and issued a general apology for making what she described as a “mistake.”

“Like anyone who’s been honest with themselves, I know that I have made mistakes,” Warren said at the Native American Presidential Forum in Sioux City, Iowa, in August. “I am sorry for harm I have caused.”

Warren will join 11 other candidates on the debate stage at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, on Tuesday evening. The Massachusetts senator’s false claims of Native American heritage have yet to become a topic of conversation at any of the primary debates."

Her gun control, made public in August on Medium, shows Warren believes the current ten percent excise tax on firearms is too low. She wants to raise that tax to 30 percent while increasing the tax on ammunition to 50 percent.

Because excise taxes are paid directly by the consumer–the taxes are added to the price of the goods–this means a $500 gun would immediately cost $650 and the price for a $20 box of ammo would immediately rise to $30.

Warren claims this taxation policy would “bring in new federal revenue” that can used for “gun violence prevention.” And she simultaneously suggests the tax would raise the price on guns and ammo to a level sufficient to stifle sales.

She does not explain how reducing sales via tax policy can bring in new revenue. Rather, she cites”federal excise tax on cigarettes, domestic wine, or even airline tickets,” to try to bolster justify pushing for more taxes on firearms and bullets.

Ironically, Warren also wants government-imposed limits on the number of guns Americans can purchase. This would cut sales as well, further reducing tax revenue.

That unique prospect could scramble the electoral calculations next year for both parties.

As impeachment proceeds, the division in the country ""is going to go into the stratosphere,"" predicts Charles Coughlin, a veteran Republican political strategist based in Phoenix. ""Which I think creates an opportunity for a candidate ... to fill that narrative: We have to start talking about what brings us together and not what pushes us apart. I think there will be giant pieces of room in the electorate, both Republican and Democratic, to articulate that notion.""

Uncharted territory

One thing that's clear already is that if the House votes to impeach Trump -- and the Senate does not reach the two-thirds majority required to remove him from office -- the nation will face a novel political situation in 2020. None of the previous three presidents who faced a serious impeachment threat appeared on the next general election ballot.

Richard Nixon retreated into exile in San Clemente and never again sought public office after he resigned in August 1974. His resignation came after the House Judiciary Committee approved articles of impeachment against him over Watergate with bipartisan support, and leading Senate Republicans told him his support in that chamber was crumbling.

Bill Clinton finished his second term as President but was barred by the Constitution's two-term limit from running again in 2000. The Republican-controlled House voted to impeach him in 1998 but the Senate fell well short of the votes needed to remove him over the perjury charges that emerged from his affair with a White House intern.

Only Andrew Johnson, among the presidents facing impeachment, sought to run again after his ordeal, though he failed to secure the nomination. Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president, picked Johnson, a pro-Union Democrat from the border state of Tennessee, as his vice president in 1864 to create a national ""unity"" ticket. But after Lincoln was assassinated in 1865 and Johnson ascended to the presidency, he reverted to his roots in a Democratic Party that, at the time, was much more sympathetic to the South and hostile to the rights of freed slaves. Johnson repeatedly tried to stymie the agenda of the Republican House and Senate majorities to ensure rights for the freed slaves and eliminate Confederate influence in the Southern states rejoining the Union.

After an escalating series of confrontations and vetoes, the House in March 1868 impeached Johnson on a party-line vote; all Republicans who voted backed impeachment and all voting Democrats opposed it. The Senate then fell one vote short of removing Johnson from office in May, just months before the 1868 election. All Senate Democrats and seven Republicans voted to acquit him on the impeachment charges, which centered on his defiance of a law the Republican majorities passed to prevent him from dismissing executive branch officials without congressional approval.

Johnson's strategic move

David O. Stewart, author of the 2009 book ""Impeached: The Trial of President Andrew Johnson and the Fight for Lincoln's Legacy,"" said the nearness of the next election was one reason that just enough senators acquitted Johnson.

""I actually think the impending election probably helped him resist the impeachment case because there were a bunch of people who said, 'He is going to be gone pretty soon so why are we killing ourselves?' "" Stewart said in an interview. ""And there was a fear of a backlash that they would make him sympathetic by pursuing him.""

Having survived the threat of removal by his adopted party in Congress, Johnson then came full circle in his partisan migration: He sought to win the Democratic nomination in 1868 to face the formidable Republican choice, Ulysses S. Grant, the general of the North's victorious armies during the war.

""Johnson desperately wanted to be nominated, and it was for vindication and he thought he could win,"" said Stewart. ""He thought Grant was vulnerable.""

Johnson sent intermediaries to make his case at the Democratic convention in New York. On the first ballot, he finished second, but it was quickly clear those votes were more a gesture of respect than a reflection of any genuine desire to choose him. Johnson quickly faded from contention and Democrats on their 22nd ballot chose as their nominee New York Gov. Horatio Seymour, who was promptly beaten by Grant.

Because there are so few precedents for how an impeachment may affect the next election -- and no precedent for the impeached president appearing on the ballot again -- experts are cautious about offering too many predictions of how today's confrontation could affect 2020.

""Anybody who says they know what is going to happen is wrong,"" says Tom Rath, a longtime Republican operative in New Hampshire. ""There is no easy parallel to find.""

A few common threads

But some common threads do run through these previous struggles, even if no one can say for sure how relevant they will prove in 2020.

One is that in each previous case, the party that drove the impeachment won the White House in the next election: Republicans triumphed in 1868 and 2000, and Democrats won in 1976. Despite predictions of a backlash, in each case the country turned away from the president's party in the succeeding election.

Another is that in each case, the winning candidate promised to restore national unity after the bitter partisan conflict.

Grant, as the leader of the victorious army during the Civil War, was a living symbol of Union. And though he was clearly identified as a champion of the North, Grant, to the extent candidates made their views known in those years, also signaled his determination to pursue reconciliation with the South. In his inaugural address, he declared that all issues relating to Reconstruction must ""be approached calmly, without prejudice, hate or sectional pride."" (Brutal violence by Southerners opposed to rights for the freed slaves forced Grant to intervene in the former Confederate states more aggressively than those words implied.)

After the ""long national nightmare"" of Watergate and Nixon's resignation, Jimmy Carter in 1976 also won election after presenting himself as a unifying figure who would restore to America ""a government as good as its people."" As an evangelical Christian who quoted Bob Dylan in his acceptance speech at the 1976 Democratic Convention, a Southerner who supported civil rights and a centrist governor who blended liberal and conservative themes, Carter embodied the promise of cultural, racial and political reconciliation after not only the bruising Nixon years but also the larger tumults of the 1960s.

""Our country's lived through a time of torment,"" Carter declared in that acceptance speech. ""It's now a time for healing. We want to have faith again. We want to be proud again. We just want the truth again.""

Trump likely to take a different tack

In 2000, after Clinton's impeachment, Republican George W. Bush won by presenting himself as a ""uniter, not a divider"" who had worked closely with Democrats in the Texas state Legislature. Bush criticized Clinton's behavior but only indirectly, through his pledge to ""restore honor and dignity to the Oval Office,"" a cornerstone of his campaign.

And Bush distanced himself at times from congressional Republicans, pledged to seek common cause with the centrist ""new Democrat"" movement that Clinton led and lamented what he called ""a cycle of bitterness, an arms race of anger.""

Though partisan conflict grew over his two terms, especially after the Iraq War, Bush initially ran in 2000 on a message of inclusion: ""I will bring Americans together,"" he said.

No one expects Trump to follow those tracks, if he remains in office after the impeachment inquiry and is able to seek reelection, as now seems most likely.

If anything, the impeachment struggle may push Trump further toward a strategy of energizing his core supporters and turning out more of them who did not vote in 2016. The reason is that the process could complicate his hopes of capturing voters ambivalent or conflicted about his presidency.

Bad impressions solidifying

So far there's not clear evidence in polling that the allegations against Trump related to Ukraine, or his belligerent response to them, are increasing the number of voters who disapprove of his performance in office or reducing the number who approve

But recent polling suggests that the new controversy is hardening the most negative impressions of Trump among the majority of voters who have consistently disapproved of him during his presidency.

""For people who have this uneasiness about him, I think this is just a really different event"" from the Russia investigation, says Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg. Unlike that controversy, she says, ""What happened in Ukraine is not about the past; it's about the future. ... And it's just letting the things about him that people don't like come to the fore in this dramatic way.""

In an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll released last week , for instance, fully 93% of voters who said they disapprove of Trump's overall performance in office said it was not acceptable ""for a president to ask a foreign country´s leader to help investigate a potential political opponent,"" according to detailed figures provided to me by Marist. Among those disapproving voters, 92% also said Trump was mostly serving his campaign's interests, not the country's, in his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Similarly, a recent Quinnipiac University national poll found that among voters who disapprove of Trump's job performance, 94% said he has abused the power of his office and 93% said he considers himself above the law, according to figures provided by the pollsters.

These sentiments pose a clear challenge to a cornerstone of the Republican strategy for 2020. Republicans believe Trump can survive majority disapproval of his performance by disqualifying the eventual Democratic nominee to the point that some voters who disapprove of Trump vote for him anyway. No one in either party rules out Trump's capacity to damage his opponent. But to the extent the impeachment fight reinforces negative views about Trump -- such as the belief that he considers himself above the law or puts his personal interests above the nation's -- winning voters who disapprove of his performance will only grow more difficult for him, whatever their views about the Democratic alternative.

""It is getting harder and harder for him to convince people who don't support his performance (in office) that they should support him for reelection,"" says Josh Schwerin, a senior strategist for Priorities USA, a leading Democratic super PAC. ""There is no good scenario here for Trump, absent some exonerating fact that doesn't seem possible. Given the facts and the numbers we are seeing, it is hard to believe he doesn't get impeached by the House and no matter what happens in the Senate it is going to be a drag on him.""

Democratic primary could also be affected

Indeed, in last week's Marist Poll, fully 95% of voters who disapproved of Trump's job performance also said they now intend to vote against him for reelection. Eight-five percent of those who disapproved in the survey endorsed the extraordinary step of the Senate removing him from office.

One of the biggest unanswered questions impeachment raises is whether the confrontation will change the kind of alternative that most voters skeptical of Trump will find appealing in 2020.

The dominant assumption among the Democratic presidential contenders gathering for a CNN debate tonight in Ohio is that after four years of searing partisan combat with Trump and congressional Republicans, the party wants a ""fighter""; even former Vice President Joe Biden, who has offered a more centrist message than his principal rivals, is promising to ""beat (Trump) like a drum.""

The Carter and Bush precedents, though, suggest there may be more of an audience than Democrats now expect for a conciliatory candidate in 2020. An impeachment fight that further fans the flames of partisan conflict could make voters less enthusiastic about replacing a conservative President who revels in political combat with a liberal, such as Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont or Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who promises unending confrontation over a different set of issues.

One final twist from the Johnson impeachment may unsettle both parties. As soon as Johnson left the White House, as Stewart recounts, he began maneuvering to return to Congress to continue his campaign against the postwar reconstruction of the South. In 1869, a time when US senators were picked by state legislatures, Johnson campaigned for an appointment in Tennessee, but fell just short. In 1872, he ran unsuccessfully for the US House. Finally, in 1875 he achieved a measure of vindication when the Tennessee state Legislature finally appointed him to a Senate seat. The satisfaction was fleeting: About four months after Johnson returned to Washington, his resentments still burning, he died from a stroke.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who has decried the ultra-wealthy’s influence in politics in the past, has received contributions from at least 30 billionaires over the course of her political career, the New York Post found.

Warren prides her presidential bid as a 100 percent grassroots-funded campaign. While she has raised millions — an impressive $24.6 million in the third quarter — she reportedly used $10.4 million in leftover funds from her 2018 senatorial bid to cushion her current campaign. During the course of her senatorial campaign, Warren happily attended fundraisers and accepted money from big donors, sparking questions surrounding her newfound commitment to keep big donors out of politics.

The New York Post analyzed Warren’s past campaign contributions and found that she has accepted donations from at least 30 billionaires throughout her political tenure.

The Post reports:

Christopher Sacca, a venture capitalist who appeared on “Shark Tank”, gave $2,800 to Warren in May. The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate also netted two $2,500 contributions from GitHub founder Tom Preston-Werner’s wife, Theresa, in June. That same month Susan Pritzker, wife of Hyatt heir Nicholas Pritzker II, donated $2,500 to Warren. The donations run from 2011 to 2019 and include contributions to Warren’s presidential and Senate campaigns. Most of the individual billionaires are giving at or near the maximum contribution limit, which currently is $2,800 for the primary and $2,800 for the general election for a total for $5,600.

This revelation comes in the wake of Warren’s public criticisms of the wealthy. Over the summer, the presidential hopeful bragged that billionaires “aren’t in favor” of the idea of her presidency:

While Warren has not gone as far as her ideological counterpart, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), in calling for the disappearance of billionaires, the “Ultra-Millionaire Tax” has become a hallmark of her campaign. The proposal would implement a two percent wealth tax on those with more than $50 million in assets. A three percent tax would be imposed on individuals with more than $1 billion in assets:

The rich & powerful run Washington. Here’s one benefit they wrote for themselves: After making a killing from the economy they’ve rigged, they don't pay taxes on that accumulated wealth. It’s a system that’s rigged for the top if I ever saw one. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 24, 2019

Warren came under fire last week after refusing to say if her potential running mate would refrain from attending high-dollar fundraisers.

“Is your vice presidential pick going to also try and avoid those high-dollar fundraisers as well?” a reporter asked.

Instead of offering an emphatic “yes,” Warren dodged the question, calling it “a little premature.”

“You know, I think it’s a little premature to be talking about vice presidential. We’re still in primary here, and I’m working hard on this,” she said.

But look, I want a vice presidential partner, someone who’s going to get out there and fight for the same values,” she added:"

The margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points indicates that Warren’s lead is firm.

According to the poll’s press release, no other candidate in the crowded Democrat field garnered more than five percent of the vote.

The survey also found that Warren is the overwhelming second choice of supporters of other candidates, signaling that her support could grow as the field begins to narrow.

Per the release:

Ms. Warren is making inroads with other candidates’ supporters too. The same group of Democratic and leaning voters were asked for their second choice, should their main pick drop out. Ms. Warren was the second choice of 34% of Democratic and leaning voters who support another candidate. Of Mr. Biden’s supporters, 45.1% chose Ms. Warren second. Of Mr. Sanders’, 31.2% chose her. “The numbers don’t look as good for Sanders and Biden,” poll co-director Danny Hayes said in a Washington Post analysis. “Sanders is the second choice of just 21% [of all Democratic and leaning voters], and Biden is the second choice of 17%.

CNN described Cox as the chair to the HRC board of directors and noted his involvement with “a real estate investment firm in Dallas, Texas.” However, CNN failed to mention Cox’s status as a Warren donor.

Donor data matching Cox’s profile indicates that he donated $2,700 to Warren in July 2017 and $2,700 in April 2018.

The Washington Free Beacon reports:

FEC filings show that a “Morgan Cox III” from Plano, Tex., who listed his occupation as “investor” donated the legal maximum of $2,700 to Warren’s Senate primary campaign in 2017, followed by two donations totaling $2,700 to her general election campaign the following year. Cox also donated $2,700 to the Elizabeth Warren Action Fund PAC. Records show that a “Morgan W. Cox III” who donated to the Human Rights Campaign and listed his employer as the Marquis Group also donated to Democratic congressional candidates Gina Ortiz Jones (Tex.), Jennifer Wexton (Va.), Nancy Soderberg (Fla.), and Annie Craig (Minn.). There is no evidence Cox has donated to any other 2020 Democratic presidential candidate.

Nonetheless, CNN failed to detail Cox’s status as a Warren donor. This, as Free Beacon notes, would not be the first time CNN has come under fire for failing to sufficiently disclose the affiliations of its town hall attendees:

The lack of disclosure comes after CNN was criticized in February for not disclosing the Democratic Party ties of town hall participants who asked harsh questions of outsider presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), including identifying the Baltimore County Democratic Party chairwoman as a “former biology professor.”

The network admitted that it “should have more fully identified any political affiliations” following the town hall controversy in February.

“Though we said at the beginning of the Town Hall that the audience was made up of Democrats and Independents, we should have more fully identified any political affiliations,” a CNN spokesperson told Fox News at the time."

Morgan Cox III – the chair of the HRC board of directors and a max Warren donor – a detail CNN failed to disclose – asked the presidential hopeful what she would say to a supporter who says their faith teaches them that marriage is between a man and a woman.

“Assuming you can find one,” she quipped, in an attempt to “burn” men of faith who embrace traditional Jude0-Christian values:

How would I respond to someone who says marriage is between one man and one woman? #EqualityTownHall pic.twitter.com/8uNXqXI5n7 — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 11, 2019

Coulter, author of Resistance Is Futile!, remarked on Warren’s “really nasty” response.

“Can you imagine,” she said of her response.

Both Mansour and Coulter agree with Warren’s call to rein in the excesses of Wall Street, but Coulter warned that all of that will go out of the window if the Massachusetts senator becomes president.

“It’s the super woke coo-coo stuff that– she’s gone so far woke, that it’s a total turnoff,” Mansour said.

Coulter concurred, adding, “Those of you listening to us who agree with Rebecca and me on hating Wall Street– I promise you. If Elizabeth Warren got elected, suddenly she’d forget about all the Wall Street stuff and it would just be pedal to the metal on transgenders.”"

—

10:45 PM: Cooper, after discussing Ellen and Dubya hanging out at a Cowboys game, asks candidates about a friendship that they have had that would surprise people or had an impact on them. Serious question: Did Cooper or CNN producers watch Phil Mickelson’s “Tribute Tuesday” Instagram posts before asking this typical MSM question? Nothing MSM loves more than “unity” and “bipartisanship.”

Castro: Rambles about people who thought differently and grew up differently. Doesn’t name anyone. Castro says we should be kind to people but should also hold people to account like George W. Bush.

Gabbard: Names Republicans like Trey Gowdy. Says Gowdy has been there for her during some personally challenging times.

Klobuchar: Names McCain.

Steyer: A woman from Denmark, South Carolina, who is fighting for clean water and environmental justice. Different race, gender, and from a different part of the country.

Beto: Says he has always tried to bring people together. Names retiring Rep. Will Hurd (R-TX).

Booker: He says he has so many he can’t count… goes to Bible study in Sen. Inhofe’s (R-OK) office and went to dinner with Sen. Cruz (R-TX).

Yang: After saying he will spend ten hours answering questions on his website on Friday, names “Fred the Felon,” a white working-class truck driver who previously supported Trump and now supports Yang.

Harris: Rand Paul. Talks about how they joined together on a bill to end cash bail.

Mayor Pete: Talks about friendships formed in the military–different race, politics.

Warren: Harvard Law Prof. Charles Fried.

Sanders: McCain for working with him on veterans issues.

Biden: McCain. Whacks Trump for being a “liar” and a “cheat.”

10:30 PM: Biden says he’s the only one on the stage who has gotten anything really big done.

Sanders rips Biden — says he got the Iraq War, NAFTA, PNTR (permanent normal trade relations) with China done.

Oh Bernie with the combo on Biden and all the bad things (Iraq, bankruptcy bill) he got done. Bam bam bam. — Matt Stoller (@matthewstoller) October 16, 2019

Warren takes credit for the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Board (CFPB).

10:23 PM: Biden says he won’t pack the Supreme Court to protect abortion rights. Biden talks about defeating Robert Bork and says we should codify Roe v Wade. Biden says if a Supreme Court Justice steps down before the next election, Mitch McConnell and the Republicans should not be allowed to hold hearings.

Buttigieg wants a 15-person Supreme Court to depoliticize the process. He says 5 members will be appointed only with the unanimous consent of 10 others.

Castro calls for term limits (or cycling off to the appellate courts) rather than packing the courts.

Warren takes the question back to abortion and says she lived in an America where abortion was illegal and rich women still got abortions. She says poor women were the ones who got hurt.

10: 09 PM: Booker, interjecting, says as the vegan, he can say that Trump is the unhealthiest person to ever run for president.

10:06 PM: Yang says Warren is 100% accurate in diagnosing the problem when asked about breaking up tech companies. Yang says breaking up tech companies, though, will not revive Main Street. He talks about the impact of screen use on children and he says breaking up tech companies does nothing to make kids healthier. Yang says using 20th century anti-trust solutions will not work.

Warren says companies can be the umpire or have a team, but you don’t get to do both. She accuses Amazon of collecting data on what sells well on their site and then going into business against them.

Beto wants tech companies to be treated as publishers, but he does not think presidents should target individual companies.

Harris asks Warren to join her in calling for Twitter to shut down Trump’s Twitter account. Warren dodges and says she wants to push Trump out of the White House.

Steyer now says Democrats need to talk about “prosperity” and the “private sector” to beat Trump before calling Trump a “fraud.” If traction gets any traction, will be interesting to see Democrats hit back at his private equity past.

Yang says data is more valuable than oil and Americans need to get their “tech check” via the freedom dividend, and that’s the best way to deal with the Big Tech problem.

9:52 PM: Burnett tries to pivot to health and Sanders says he’s feeling great. Booker says Sanders supports medical marijuana and Sanders replies: “I’m not on it tonight.”

Burnett asks Sanders how he will assure voters that he is up for the presidency. Sanders talks about an upcoming rally in Queens and says he will mount a “vigorous campaign” to prove to people that he is fit for the presidency.

He thanks everyone who sent good wishes from the bottom of his heart and says he is so glad to be back up on the debate stage.

Biden says he is running because of his “age and experience” because with it comes “wisdom.” He says now, more than ever, someone with that capacity is needed in the White House.

Warren, when asked about age, says she will outwork, out-organize, and outlast everyone–and “that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with.”

9:50 PM: On opioids, Steyer goes back to one of the central themes of his campaign–that corporations have bought the government.

Yang calls for decriminalizing opioids. He says there were more opioid prescriptions than people in Ohio and the crisis is one of “capitalism run amok.” He says the government must invest in treatment plans and people cannot be worried about going to jail cells if they come in for treatment. He says first responders in New Hampshire have told him they see the same people over and over again.

Beto also says he is for decriminalization of opioids while Harris calls pharmaceutical companies and executives “high-level dope dealers” and says some executives need to go to jail. “This is a matter of justice,” she says, adding that we should end mass incarceration and the War on Drugs and go after pharmaceutical executives.

Castro says drug company executives should go to jail and also need to be held accountable financially. He says Wall Street executives also must be held to account.

9:40 PM: Warren in favor of voluntary buyback programs and not mandatory buyback programs. She says the former got machine guns off the streets.

Castro asked about preventing deaths via handguns. Castro says he has problems with mandatory buyback programs because people don’t want cops coming to their homes… talks about police officers killing innocent people in their homes. He says “police violence is also gun violence, and we need to address that.”

9:30 PM: Beto asked about mandatory buybacks. He has disagreed with Mayor Pete on this.

Beto asked how he would endorse that when he doesn’t even know who has AR-15s. Beto calls them “weapons of war” that are “too dangerous to sell.” Beto says they are also “too dangerous to own” because every single one of them is a “potential instrument of terror.” He says just ask “any Hispanic in Texas” and accused Trump of inciting racists to target Hispanics in his community. Beto says if someone does not turn in their “weapons of war” and “brandishes” it in public, that weapon “will be taken from them.”

Buttigieg asked whether mandatory buybacks equal “confiscation.” He says Beto just made it clear that he does not know how to get weapons off the street. Mayor Pete says we can’t wait for Red Flag laws and universal background checks. He says we can’t wait for purity test and must “get something done.”

Mayor Pete says he doesn’t need lessons from Beto on courage–political or personal. He goes on to rip the NRA and their “enablers” in Congress. Beto hits Mayor Pete for calling his buyback plan a “shiny object.” He says “that was a slap in the face” to every survivor of gun violence.

9:22 PM: Castro rips Trump for caging kids at the border while letting ISIS prisoners go free. He says there is no reason for Kim Jong Un to trust anything Trump has to say re: nuclear agreement when he ripped up the Iran Deal and betrayed the Kurds.

Booker accuses Trump of partnering more with Putin than Merkel and Macron.

Biden says he has spent time alone with Putin and Erdogan. He says Trump is an “erratic” and “crazy” president who doesn’t “know a damn” about foreign policy. Biden says Erdogan knows how terrible it would if Turkey got booted from NATO. Biden says if Trump is elected, there will be no NATO.

Biden counters Gabbard’s “regime-change” war claim, saying it was to prevent Assad from “wiping out” thousands of people.

Beto says Russia is “invading” American democracy and then says “in addition” in Spanish out of the blue.

9:12 PM: Gabbard, appropriately asked about Syria.

She says Trump “has the blood of the Kurds on his hand.” She rips both parties and the mainstream media for “championing” the regime-change war that has led to the death of the Kurds. She rips CNN and the New York Times for smearing veterans like her for wanting to end the “regime-change war” in Syria. Says it is “despicable” that CNN had a pundit who implied she was a “Russia asset.”

Gabbard asks Warren to join her in calling for an end to the regime-change wars.

Warren says she doesn’t want troops in the Middle East but America must do it in the right way. She then accuses Trump of sucking up to dictators and enriching himself at the expense of America. She accuses Trump of giving ISIS a “new lease on life.”

Gabbard rips Buttigieg for wanting more regime-change wars in Syria. The two veterans differing. Buttigieg says when he was deployed, what protected him was that the American flag meant keeping our word and says Trump is undermining the “honor” of our soldiers. He says if you take away their honor, you might as well take away their armor.

Sanders says Turkey is no longer a U.S. ally when they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter. Sanders says 11,000 Kurds died and 20,000 were wounded fighting ISIS and now no country will trust the word of the United States. Sanders says Trump, the “pathological liar,” has wrecked the country’s ability to engage with other nations re: foreign policy issues.

KAMALA makes it clear – there are 4 winners because of what Donald Trump has done: 1) Russia

2) Iran

3) Assad

4) ISIS — Lily Adams (@adamslily) October 16, 2019

9:10 PM: Debate turns to foreign policy. Biden says he would not have withdrawn troops from Syria or Iraq. He says when Trump said the ISIS prisoners who are freed would go to Europe, it is the most shameful thing ever said by a modern president. Biden says he will make it clear to Syria’s Assad that “Turkey is the real problem here.” When asked if he wants American troops back in Syria, Biden says he wants the 1,000 troops protected by air cover and will make it clear that they are not going anywhere and will protect the Kurds.

9:05: Interesting observation:

No candidate has attacked Biden tonight, even though he remains the front-runner, at least technically. They see that his campaign is deflating. Warren is the real threat. — Robert Reich (@RBReich) October 16, 2019

9:00 PM: Castro wants an inheritance tax and to raise the top marginal rate. He talks about having visited homeless people living in storm drains in Vegas.

Booker wants Democrats to talk more about child poverty. He says the country must deal with the “moral obscenity” of its high child poverty rate.

8:55 PM: Harris now being asked about her tax credit. She tells a story about her mom at the kitchen table “trying to figure out how to make it all work.” Harris again repeats lines from her stump speech about how “justice is on the ballot.”

Burnett asks Yang about the wealth tax. He says it makes a lot of sense in principle but countries have repealed it because it had massive implementation problems. Yang calls for a value-added tax (VAT). Again, credit to Burnett for bringing in Yang into the discussion.

Beto says Democrats need to be more focused on lifting people on… he says Warren is more focused on “being punitive” and pitting some part of the country against the other.

Warren says she doesn’t “have a beef” with billionaires. She says billionaires made it because “all of us” helped them get there. She again calls for them to “pitch in” two cents so every other kids gets a chance.

(Bernie’s national press secretary, though, does have a “beef” with billionaires):

8:50 PM: Buttigieg, on Warren’s wealth tax, says it sounds good but could be an example of yet another Washington policy that sounds great but will accomplish nothing. Warren keeps defending her wealth tax, says it is needed for investments in the next generation. Yang has been making the case that it will be so easy for people to game the wealth tax, perhaps even renouncing citizenship, to avoid paying it but he has yet to jump in to make that point.

8:45 PM: Beto says if Mexicans should join unions if their companies do business with America.

Biden wants to double the capital gains tax and says the problem with these debates is that everyone wants to cram everything in in a short amount of time. Biden says the greedy corporations and the Fourth Industrial revolution creating job losses.

8:35 PM: Warren says the top reason Americans have lost jobs is bad trade policies and corporations with no loyalty to America workers, consumers, and communities.

8:30 PM: Debate now turns to jobs and automation. And Erin Burnett goes to Sanders first and asks him about his jobs guarantee program. Sanders says “damn right” everyone will get a job. Yang and Sanders have disagreed on this issue. Yang says his freedom dividend is more practical than Sanders’s jobs program.

Yang points out that not everyone wants to work for the federal government and many people who lose their jobs to automation cannot be “retrained” for various federal jobs. He says $1,000/month is better for the “trickle up economy.”

YANG, on jobs: 'Most Americans do not want to work for the federal government… If we put the money into our hands, we can build a trickle-up economy.' #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/3PO4RBpMt8 — NowThis (@nowthisnews) October 16, 2019

Booker jumps in to rip CNN for asking Biden about Hunter and says Trump was happy with that exchange. Says CNN elevated a lie and attacked a statesman.

Yang talks about the impact that automation will have on various communities that rely on truck drivers (diners). Gabbard is against a federal jobs guarantee and agrees with her friend Yang about UBI.

An important segment about automation and the new economy in a state that will be impacted by it would not have been possible had it not been for Yang’s candidacy. Credit to Erin Burnett for outstanding questioning and going to Yang right after Sanders and getting them to talk about their difference. Great segment for Burnett.

8:20 PM: Warren asked a “yes or no” answer about whether she will raise taxes for Medicare for all. Another dodge. She says costs will go up for the wealthy and down for those who are not. She rips insurance companies for “pulling the rug” from under people.

Buttigieg points out Warren is being evasive and says she is why why people are frustrated with Washington. Buttigieg says Warren supposedly has a plan for everything except for health care. He touts his “Medicare for all who want it” idea.

Warren says when someone hears “Medicare for all who want it,” it means “Medicare for all who can afford it.”

Sanders says his Medicare for All plan that Warren endorsed will be better than Canada’s but taxes will go up and will go up “significantly for the wealthy.” Warren keeps dodging the question and Klobuchar calls her out for not being honest and promoting a “pipe dream.”

Warren pivots to saying she spent most of her time not in Washington but studying how people went bankrupt–most due to healthcare bills even though they had insurance. Warren keeps dodging.

Biden talks again about building on Obamacare. Biden says Democrats must be straight with Americans on the single most important issue.

Sanders says the debate should be about whether Democrats have the “guts” to stand up to the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. Sanders says we must stop defending the “cruel” and “unjust” system.

Harris says Democrats should be talking more about abortion and says women, especially women of color, will die because of Republican legislatures in the states.

Kamala Harris: ""It's not an exaggeration to say women will die — poor women, women of color will die — because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with their bodies"" #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/rtyjHfQnBT — CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 16, 2019

8:16 PM: Cooper asks Biden about his son Hunter. He asks if it is not okay for a president’s son to be involved in foreign businesses, why is it okay for a vice president’s son. Biden says neither he nor his son did “nothing wrong.” “My son’s statement speaks for itself,” Biden says, basically cuing up a potential attack ad. Biden says Trump is afraid of him because if he wins the nomination he will “beat him like a drum.” Biden says he and his son kept everything separate. Says Hunter made a judgment and he is “prod” of the judgment he made. Biden then pivots back to Trump’s “corruption.”

Sanders says Democrats must also focus on the “pain of the working class of this country.”

8:06 PM: Biden, who finally came around on impeachment, says Democrats have been fair and he agrees with Sanders that Trump is the most corrupt president in history.

Harris says Trump has committed crimes in “plain sight.” Cites Maya Angelou. She also accuses Trump of “selling out” working people, national security, and democracy. Harris, reciting her greatest Twitter hits, says as a prosecutor she knows a confession when she sees it and says the impeachment process won’t take long. She says Trump is the most corrupt and unpatriotic president.

Booker says impeachment has to be about “patriotism” and not “partisanship.” He says Democrats have to conduct this process in a way that is “honorable” and “doesn’t rip us apart.” Says Trump has violated his duty.

Now, for some reason, Cooper goes to Klobuchar, who is barely registering in the polls. She accuses Trump of “illegal conduct” for “digging up dirt” on an opponent. She says Trump has left the Kurds “for slaughter.” She says Trump has made “Russia great again.”

Castro says Democrats can “walk and chew gum at the same time” when asked if impeachment is a distraction. He says Trump is violating his oath of office and abusing his power.

Buttigieg says Trump has left Congress “no choice” but to launch an impeachment inquiry. He says the impeachment inquiry is about whether, when people look back 100 years from now, a president was above the law and could get away with anything. He presents himself as the bipartisan candidate.

Gabbard says impeachment will divide the country if driven by “hyper-partisan interests.”

Steyer says every candidate on stage is more decent and patriotic than “the criminal in the White House.” He talks about starting his Need to Impeach movement two years ago.

Yang supports impeachment (implies Senate will not convict) but says impeachment will not solve the issues that got Donald Trump elected. Pivots to the central theme of his campaign about Fourth Industrial Revolution. Yang says Democrats “are losing” when they are talking about Trump.

Beto says he thinks about everyone who has ever served in uniform and says we have a responsibility to be “fearless in the face of this president’s criminality and lawlessness.”

8:05 PM: Sanders says Democrats have “no choice” but to impeach Trump because Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country. He thinks the House will find him worthy of impeachment because of the Emoluments Clause. He says Trump is using the Oval Office to enrich himself. Sanders says Mitch McConnell must do the right thing and allow free and fair trial in the Senate.

8:00 PM: Debate begins. First question (for Warren) is about impeachment. Warren says the impeachment inquiry is necessary during an election year because some things are bigger than politics. She cites the Mueller report (obstruction of justice) and says “look what happened as a result” of not opening an impeachment inquiry after the Mueller report was released. Warren says this is also about the next president and the next president…

7:55 PM: Cooper introducing the candidates as the debate is about to get started.

7:36 PM: DNC Chair Tom Perez thinks Democrats can take back Ohio in 2020. Democrats want Ohio to be the state that ends Trump’s presidency. Perez rips Trump and says the election is not about “left versus right” but about “right versus wrong.”

7:35 PM: Watch what Ohio residents think of Democrats–Video from Breitbart’s Matt perdie and Zenny phuong in Ohio:

7:30 PM: CNN hyping the number of candidates (12) on stage as if it is a good thing.

Is the word out that Dems are not allowed to talk about Hunter Biden at the debate? If he did nothing wrong taking those jobs, why’d he promise not to do it again? Why’d he say he discussed it with his father when his father says they didn’t? Many questions. Will Dems ask? — Tim Murtaugh (@TimMurtaugh) October 15, 2019

Trump trying to lock up Ohio, the B1G swing state he is most likely to win:"

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and S… [+5902 chars]","Despite efforts to draw distinctions between each other, the leading 2020 Democrat presidential primary candidates are unified to bring more immigration, and thus more labor market competition for American workers, to the United States if elected.",2019-10-15,Breitbart News,Leading 2020 Dems Unified to Turn Red States Blue with More Immigration,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/14/2020-democrats-unified-for-more-immigration/,"Despite efforts to draw distinctions between each other, the leading 2020 Democrat presidential primary candidates are unified to bring more immigration, and thus more labor market competition for American workers, to the United States if elected.

Though polling among all U.S. voters, and particularly with swing voters, finds campaigning for immigration, illegal and legal, is the most unpopular policy position, leading candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) have gone above and beyond past Democrat candidates in their vows to drive a large migration to the country.

That increase in immigration would likely have significant consequences for states like Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia. As research by the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Axios, experts, and demographers has repeatedly discovered, an increase in the foreign-born population via immigration inevitably translates to an increase in likely Democrat voters.

At current legal immigration levels, the U.S. is already on track to bring at least 15 million new foreign-born voters to the country in the next decade. These voters’ swing towards Democrats has already been realized in the 2016 presidential election, where despite winning almost 50 percent of native-born Americans, Trump lost foreign-born voters to Hillary Clinton by 64 percent.

Elizabeth Warren

Warren has portrayed her run for president as a populist movement, similar to that of Sanders’ and Trump’s campaigns in the 2016 presidential election, but her immigration platform is a carbon copy of the donor class’s and Washington, D.C. beltway’s longtime effort to force down wages for Americans by increasing legal immigration levels.

Aside from promising to decriminalize illegal immigration and provide free taxpayer-funded healthcare to all 11 to 22 million illegal aliens, Warren is seeking to gift the big business lobby with a massive increase in legal immigration — levels which are already historically high, as at least 1.2 million legal immigrants are added to the U.S. population every year.

That increase in legal immigration, Warren has said, will include an increase in chain migration, whereby newly naturalized citizens are allowed to bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S. Today, chain migration makes up more than 70 percent of all legal immigration, and in the last decade the process has brought almost 10 million foreign nationals to the U.S.

Like her legal immigration agenda, Warren plans to surge refugee resettlement to the country by at least 700 percent. As Breitbart News has chronicled, mass fraud is prevalent in the refugee system, with African refugees often fraudulently obtaining refugee status.

Joe Biden

Biden has been less direct about his plan to increase immigration to the U.S.

Like the majority of 2020 Democrats, he has endorsed providing free taxpayer-funded healthcare to illegal aliens, a plan that healthcare experts have said will drive a migration of illegal aliens with “serious health problems” to the country.

Biden’s strategy to increase immigration, though, has been to provide green cards to all foreign students who graduate from American universities and to bring as many legal immigrants to the country as feasibly possible — regardless of its impacts on U.S. citizens and workers.

Biden said in August:

We could afford to take in a heartbeat another two million people. The idea that a country of 330 million people cannot absorb people who are in desperate need … is absolutely bizarre … I would also move to increase the total number of immigrants able to come to the United States.”

In 2013, while speaking to the financial industry, Biden touted a plan to increase the number of H-1B foreign visa workers that corporations are allowed to import to replace American workers.

Every year, more than 100,000 foreign workers are brought to the U.S. on the H-1B visa and are allowed to stay for up to six years. There are about 650,000 H-1B visa foreign workers in the U.S. at any given moment. Americans are often laid off in the process and forced to train their foreign replacements, as highlighted by Breitbart News. More than 85,000 Americans annually potentially lose their jobs to foreign labor through the H-1B visa program.

Bernie Sanders

Sanders has on occasion denounced the idea of open borders, calling such a policy a “Koch brothers proposal” to drive down the wages of American workers by forcing them to compete against the world’s workforce.

“It would make everybody in America poorer,” Sanders said in 2015 of open borders. Sanders has revisited that sentiment in his 2020 presidential campaign — even calling for more detention space for border crossers to end Catch and Release — but his broader immigration plan reflects that of the open borders lobby.

For example, Sanders’ latest plan ends deportations of illegal aliens and border crossers, decriminalizes illegal immigration, and promotes the DREAM Act, which would provide amnesty to the majority of illegal aliens currently living in the U.S., creating a new flood of legalized foreign labor that American workers would be forced to compete against.

Where Sanders has differed from his two top contenders is on his plan to make subtle changes to the H-1B visa system and prevent American workers from having to compete against illegal aliens for U.S. jobs.

Like Trump, Sanders has warned against corporations using the H-1B visa program to import cheaper foreign workers instead of hiring qualified and job-ready Americans.

Out of all the 2020 Democrats running for president, Sanders is the only candidate who earns a “mixed” review from NumbersUSA’s scorecard, the organization that tracks the records of politicians on whether or not they support less immigration to boost wages and job opportunities for Americans.

Sanders is the only 2020 Democrat that has mostly endorsed nationwide mandatory E-Verify to ban U.S. companies from hiring illegal aliens over American citizens. Nonetheless, Sanders’ support for mass amnesty, critics have said, will mean that those illegal aliens currently in the country would be able to eventually compete against Americans in the workforce and pass through the E-Verify system.

The poll, taken September 29-October 7, 2019 among 998 registered voters in North Carolina, shows the president besting all of his potential rivals in the crucial battleground state.

Respondents were asked, “If the election for president was held today, would you vote for Republican Donald Trump, Democrat Joe Biden, or someone else?” The survey asked the same question for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D).

While Biden fared the best in a hypothetical general election matchup in the Republican-leaning swing state, Trump still led the former vice president with 38.4 percent to Biden’s 34.6 percent.

The others are as follows:

Trump: 39.1 percent

Warren: 33 percent Trump: 38.8 percent

Sanders: 32.5 percent Trump 39.1 percent

Harris 28.4 percent Trump: 39 percent

Buttigieg: 27 percent

One of the most significant narratives moving into the 2020 election is the state of the economy, which Trump has touted as one of his greatest accomplishments. Of those surveyed, 13.7 percent described the condition of the economy as “excellent,” 28.7 percent described it as “good,” and 33.1 percent described it as “fair.” Only 13.3 percent described the condition of the economy as “poor.”

Trump won North Carolina in 2016 with 49.8 percent of the vote to Hillary Clinton’s 46.2 percent. While Republicans hold an edge in the state, former President Barack Obama flipped the state blue in 2008, beating late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) by less than half of a percentage point."

Cory Booker (D-NJ) recently sat down with NPR and discussed his struggle connecting with black voters in America, a struggle he denied.

Booker’s comments were made during an episode of NPR’s “Off Script,” where a conversation between Booker and two voters was moderated by Ari Shapiro.

“When we talk about the presidential candidacy, a lot of times they say they don’t feel like you are the voice — the black voice — for the black youth,” said education advocate Shanell Dunns. “How do you respond to not being able to connect to that demographic of youth?”

Booker quipped back, denying the claim that many black voters do not see him as “the black voice” for black youth.

“Well, No. 1: I think we actually do connect to it. Some of our biggest support is from HBCUs to African American young people who are big activists for our campaign. It’s one of the groups we do very well in,” Booker said.

A recent poll showed Booker trailing several Democrat presidential hopefuls in regards to support from black voters. Those who outrank Booker with support from black voters include former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

Booker went on to note his work with the First Step Act.

“So let my work speak for me,” Booker said. “In the United States Senate, I’ve pushed more than a dozen bills on these issues that span from police accountability all the way to the bill that I actually got passed … the First Step Act, which has already led to the liberation of thousands of people, overwhelmingly black and Latino people.”

Shapiro then pressed Booker on his record as Newark mayor from 2006 until 2013, specifically the Justice Department’s investigation into the city’s police force, which received “serious allegations of civil rights violations.”

“I inherited the police department with decades-long problems and patterns and practices,” Booker claimed as he responded to Shapiro.

Booker also stated his administration made “tremendous strides” to correct problems within the police force.

“At first I was like, ‘Why do I need the DOJ?’ But when they presented us with the data, we saw that we were not moving fast enough to correct the problems,” he added."

The focus group — convened by Axios and Engagious/FPG last week — showed that swing voters are “expressing a range of unease” about impeaching President Trump, according to an Axios report.

The fears range from impeaching hurting the economy to frustrations that House Democrats are most invested in going after Trump than in helping people, said the report.

The participants said impeachment made them feel “concerned,” “uneasy,” “exhausted,” “sad that they’re [Democrats] so focused on it,” and “a big distraction from what we could be doing.”

Axios noted that the findings are a counterpoint to recent national polls, including the Fox News poll, that showed that more Americans favor impeaching and removing Trump.

On “why it matters,” Axios explained, “If such sentiments last and play out on a larger scale across pivotal states, it spells trouble for Democrats unless they can reframe what they’re trying to accomplish.”

Brad P., a 40-year-old Trump voter, called impeachment “a never-ending drama” that “shows to me these people are completely out of touch with everyday Americans’ lives.”

Two people doubted that Trump asked Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, and others did not think it warrants impeachment if he did. “Is there undeniable proof?” asked one man.

Participants similarly had negative things to say about the Democrats.

“They need to focus on the real issues,” said Judy D., a 60-year-old Trump voter, said. “[Nancy] Pelosi hates him so bad, I just think she needs to drop it and worry about the country.”

Deborah G., a 56-year-old Clinton voter, said, “They need to be concentrating on the country, not what he’s doing wrong,”

Eric B., a 34-year-old Trump voter, said, “They hit a big strike on Mueller, so this is trying to get another base hit on the president.”

Richelle W., a 40-year-old Trump voter, said, “It’s become more of … ‘Destroy the other party’ instead of build the whole country up.”

Rocco P., a 40-year-old Trump voter, offered this advice to Democrats, saying, “Just drop it. Beat Trump at the ballot box.”

Lisa A., who was a Clinton voter, didn’t think impeachment was a great idea, but said, “I believe in the checks and balances,” and “I’m not scared of the process.”

The focus group was held in Mahoning Country, which Trump lost by less than 4,000 votes. Eight of the focus group participants swung from Barack Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016, and three switched from Mitt Romney to Hillary Clinton.

Six of the 11 participants say they have made up their minds for 2020 — four of the participants said they will definitely vote for Trump again, one former Trump voter said he will vote for Andrew Yang, and one Clinton voter, Lisa A., said she’s leaning toward Elizabeth Warren.

Five are undecided.

“While a focus group is not a statistically significant sample like a poll, these responses show how some voters are thinking and talking about the 2020 election in crucial counties,” Axios’s report said.

Rand Paul (R-KY) is out with a new book, The Case Against Socialism, and explained his case and vision in a lengthy exclusive interview on Sirius XM’s Breitbart News Sunday this weekend.

In the interview, Paul said that from Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime in Germany to Josef Stalin’s Soviet Union to Mao Zedong’s China to Fidel Castro’s Cuba to Pol Pot’s Cambodia to Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro’s Venezuela, socialism has worse than failed in every single country it has been attempted. And while he says that modern American socialists like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) claim “they don’t want that kind of socialism” that results in “authoritarianism, genocide, and famine,” there is no case where socialism has ever worked and it always ends up there.

“I think that’s one of the questions that comes up very quickly is some people are incredulous you even have to make the case because history is replete with examples of socialism gone awry, socialism devolving into authoritarianism, genocide, and famine,” Paul said in a half-hour special that aired Sunday evening on Breitbart News Sunday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel.

“The 20th century really is the history of the failure of socialism, from Hitler’s Nazi or nationalist socialism to Stalin’s Bolshevik socialism to Mao’s socialism to Pol Pot. Really, time and time again, millions of people have died at the hands of despotic rulers,” Paul said. “Some would say today’s socialists like AOC and Bernie don’t want that kind of socialism, but actually there was a time when Bernie was very sympathetic to Castro as well as Chávez. This seems to be the pattern for today’s socialists is that they’re very, very open to socialism until they find out that it’s replaced by authoritarianism and until they find out it’s been replaced by poverty.”

Paul points to Venezuela as a key recent historical example of socialism “gone awry.”

“This is true in Venezuela in particular,” Paul said. “All the American left was in love, even people who didn’t claim to be socialists, were in love Chávez and claimed he was reducing poverty, but in the end in Venezuela it’s become so desperate that the average person has lost 20 pounds not because they intended to but for lack of food. Venezuela was once one of the richest countries—probably the richest country—in South America. They still have more oil reserves than Saudi Arabia, but there’s still shortages of food. The common people can’t eat. You see people like their leader, Maduro—their socialist leader—becoming more and more overweight; he’s probably added something like 50 pounds while the average person is losing 20 pounds. So I think you see example after example of socialism not working and devolving into state violence, but I think even more important though is we now—you think most people would know that, but what we have now is polls showing people today, especially youth, think socialism might be a good idea. You have some polls showing over 50 percent of young people thinking we ought to try socialism. So my wife and I got together and wrote this book thinking gosh, we have to remind them of the history of socialism, but we also have to remind them that socialism historically has also devolved into violence.”

Socialism, Paul argues, has taken over the Democrat Party, fueled by an angry presidential primary battle that has resulted in a “bidding war” of sorts between that party’s leaders attempting to outdo each other.

“I think it’s become a kind of a bidding war among the presidential candidates on the Democrat side,” Paul said. “One person will offer free college, and the other person will say, ‘No, free college and free benefits for paid leave,’ and then another one will say, ‘What about Medicare for All?’ So it just goes on and on and on, in sort of a bidding war on the left for who can offer more free stuff. But there needs to be an examination of who really pays for so-called ‘free stuff.’ This is one of the big lies we point out in The Case Against Socialism, is that Bernie and AOC say, ‘Oh the top one percent will pay for all this.’ But when you add it up, there’s just not enough money. What they have proposed on the top one percent would maybe bring in $50 billion, but their spending desires are closer to $60, $70, or even $80 trillion. So there’s definitely a mismatch and a math problem for these people.”

In addition to the mathematical and historical issues with socialism, Paul argues, current socialists using Scandinavian countries like Denmark and Sweden to argue socialism works are false analogies.

“But even worse, they point to the so-called socialism of Scandinavia and say, ‘Oh yeah, we used to like Chávez, we used to like Castro, we used to like the Sandinistas, but now what we really like is Scandinavian socialism,’” Paul said. “So we examine that, my wife and I did a great deal of research and we examined Scandinavian socialism and what we came up with is interestingly they are not socialist. They have private property; most of the businesses are owned privately. They have a private stock exchange. In fact, the prime minister of Denmark when Bernie kept saying, ‘Denmark is this great socialist nation,’ the prime minister actually came out and said, ‘Bernie, you need to pipe down; we’re not a socialist country.’ In fact, he almost got alarm in his voice because he was worried people might not come there to do business anymore because they might think they were a socialist nation. Most of the indexes of freedom, trade, and capitalism actually rank the Scandinavian countries quite high. So really what Bernie is selling is a bill of goods here. They will then argue that the Scandinavian countries have a lot of free stuff—they do have a lot of free stuff, welfare, and state goodies that come with big government, but the interesting thing with Scandinavia is it’s much different than Bernie and AOC say. What happens in Scandinavia is the working class pay a huge amount of taxes. The working class pay a 25 percent sales tax on everything, including food, and the working class and middle class also pay income tax, whereas many in our country on the lower end are excluded from the income tax, whereas what you find over there is even at $60,000 you have a 60 percent income tax. So, really, I think it’s important that we explode the myths of American socialists that Scandinavia is socialist but also explode the myth that you can have all this free stuff and the only people that pay are the top one percent in America. There’s just not enough money, and it’s just not true.”

Paul is troubled by a rising interest in socialism among America’s youth, as evidenced by some increased support for the radical and failed ideology in recent polling, and is concerned that American young people are not learning this history in school. While he thinks some of it is just a natural tradition of Americans being more leftist when they are young and becoming more conservative as they get older, he is concerned that some of what is happening is due to a lack of education on the historical failures of socialism and misconception about what socialism really entails—government control of the means of production.

“I think there’s always been a trend for young people to be more liberal—or more open to socialism—you know the old saying was, ‘If you don’t believe in liberal policies before age 30 you don’t have a heart, but if you don’t believe in conservative polices after age 30 you don’t have a brain,’” Paul said. “There is some truth to it. When you’re younger, you live on your parents’ dole. In many ways, you are a dependent who has not necessarily seen the working world or seen what it’s like and seen that paying taxes is necessary. So I do think people become more conservative over time. It’s also true that the polls that show younger people and millennials leaning toward socialism, when they ask these young people ‘What is socialism?’ only 16 or 17 percent of them can actually answer what socialism is and socialism is traditionally defined as the state owning the means of production and you don’t have private property—there is collective ownership of things. For most young people, if they’re just reading one sentence on Twitter, I guess they’re not reading much history. Some of it is a misconception, but some of it also is a function of our schools in that I think there’s a sort of unified groupthink in schools that teaches kids that things are sort of unfair out there and that it’s a rotten world and the government is going to make things more equal and more fair. So I think some of them want to see government-enforced equality, but we make the case in The Case Against Socialism that if you want equality of outcomes you would have to have equality police.”

Paul further explains the left’s hypocrisy when it comes to a “fairness police” that he says would be necessary under a socialist system to ensure “equal outcome” by noting that it cuts against core American beliefs of “equal protection under the law.”

“You would have to have a fairness police that is going to show up with truncheons to make people fair again because any time you sort of advocate for equal outcome you basically push to make everyone equal all the time, the world is not that way,” Paul said. “You have unequal talents, some people work harder than others, some people are luckier, some people are taller, some people are smarter, some people are faster—there’s all kinds of reasons why there are not equal outcomes. But the irony is if you want to have equal outcomes the law and the government actually has to treat people unequally. You think the left would think this through, and they would realize that the whole idea of equal protection under the law—that everybody should be treated the same—is a principle that the left prided themselves in and almost everyone prides themselves in now and yet if you have equal outcomes you won’t have equal protection under the law. You actually will have to law that will treat people in an unequal way.”

Part of why Paul said there is a rush to socialism in America’s youth is a legitimate concern with political corruption in America, something grassroots movements on both the left and the right have felt for many years. There is, he said, a political, cultural, and financial elite that seems to ordinary Americans to be above the rest of society when it comes to the law and because of that corruption people challenge the system—on both sides of the political aisle. He is concerned, however, that the left’s pandering with socialism would only make the system worse because it would empower more cronyism and more corruption if ever implemented, whereas conservatives’ vision of less government cuts into the ability of bad actors to act badly.

“I think you’ve hit the nail on the head. Both left and right, the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street movement, they’re all sort of unhappy about—myself included—about crony capitalism, about people who manipulate government and manipulate the law to have an unfair advantage,” Paul said. “It’s not just that they’re selling something that people want and have become successful like Sam Walton, it’s things like some of the big pharmaceutical companies and things that come to Washington and manipulate government to enrich themselves and then abuse the rules to enrich themselves more and more. So yes I think both sides—both right and left—see this. I remember when the bankers were bailed out in 2009, these very wealthy bankers and very wealthy banks that had made rotten decisions. In the end, the poor homeowner was kicked out of his house or her house but the banks were bailed out. So the Occupy Wall Street movement was offended by that and so was the Tea Party. The real difference is the answer. It’s one thing to be angry about crony capitalism. For those on the left, it’s because crony capitalism is a failure they think we should try socialism. For those of us on the right, or the Tea Party movement, we look at crony capitalism and say that’s too much government—that’s people abusing government.”

Paul added that the right’s vision is more effective in solving the problems of corruption because it takes the power away from that handful of people who would wield it dishonorably. And that is exactly the problem with socialism, he said, as evidenced by all its historical failures: Bad actors rise up and inevitably wield said power unfairly in what ends up benefitting the few at the top and screwing over the many throughout society.

“We decided that what we wanted was less government, more of a government restrained and restricted and limited by the Constitution and less crony capitalism in a sense that what we wanted to inject was more of a free market and more voluntary transactions,” Paul said. “So it is sort of ironic that both right and left are both motivated by the same problem we see, and they come up with very different solutions and I think that’s why the book we have The Case Against Socialism is so important is because it’s about choices. It’s about voters in our country who get to think about what kind of economic system we want. And I guess our point in the book is we don’t think it’s an accident that throughout history every time socialism has been tried it has wound up in genocide and famine. The stories from Mao’s China, the stories from Pol Pot in Cambodia, the stories currently from Venezuela, I mean they are horrifying stories. People are eating their pets in Venezuela. People need to know this. The other side will complain and say that’s not real socialism, that’s a bunch of kleptocrats. And yet that’s the people who are elected, that’s their party label—they are from the socialist party—and again the apologists for socialism say ‘oh that’s not what we really want. These people now are just thugs.’ But why is it time and time again socialism devolves into thuggery? So, I think this is an important and timely book and I hope it will get the readership necessary to shape and influence some of the next generation.”

Paul added that he’s looked at experts and historical analysis to question whether socialism inevitably ends up in authoritarian regimes intent on genocide and famine, or if that just keeps happening accidentally. He argues that the experts like Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek have examined this very question and found that under socialism, ruthlessness prevails in leadership and violence becomes necessary for implementation.

“People keep getting back to this idea of whether it’s an inevitability to have this kind of authoritarianism and violence or whether it’s an accident,” Paul said. “Hayek and others looked at this, and they said it shouldn’t be looked at as a one-off or accidental in history that socialism devolves into violence because if you ultimately want to collectivize the farms as Mao did or Stalin did, if you want to take property from people, there is a point at which they will resist. Really, the leader that exhibits that most ruthless character is the one who’s able to take the land because it ultimately does require, as Lenin and others said, you’ve got to break a few eggs to make an omelette. The thing is is ultimately this is what happens. You end up choosing a few leaders; they get selected by the rest of the socialists because they are the most ruthless and willing to actually use the violence necessary to take the property. But really, our kids need to learn this history and read about it. Pol Pot was not that long ago in Cambodia with the killing fields and just hundreds and hundreds if not thousands of bodies piled in mass graves. In a very short period of time they expelled virtually everybody from the cities and ultimately millions of people were killed. This is the kind of thing that people say, ‘Oh that’s not what I want.’”

But, Paul argues, if Americans vote for socialist leadership, what ultimately happens next is evident throughout history.

“But if you’re for socialism, if you’re for the collectivization of ownership, if you believe that the collective is more important than the individual, ultimately this is what happens,” Paul said. “If you don’t think the individual is important and you disdain individual rights, then it’s sort of like it’s okay to have drone-like slaves because then what you’re about is the hive and you’re not really concerned about the individual. Our country was founded on something completely different, individual liberty. Our bill of rights is directed toward individuals not toward classifications and these are important traditions but I think it’s not being taught in school. Today’s sort of Twitter society is short attention span and not reading. I think it’s important to have the ammunition out there and we’re hoping that The Case Against Socialism will be that ammunition to help people make an informed decision and hopefully prevent America, as President Trump said, from ever becoming a socialist nation.”

Before Paul’s interview with Breitbart News, he had appeared on The View opposite, among others, Ana Navarro—the frequent critic of President Donald Trump—who shut Paul down when he was explaining what socialism was and why it was bad and why it failed in Venezuela. Paul, when asked about Navarro’s silencing of him, told Breitbart News that exposing socialism does not fit Navarro’s “narrative” of hateful opposition to President Trump—something shared by the other hosts of The View—so she would rather just not discuss these inconvenient truths at all.

“It doesn’t really fit their narrative,” Paul said. “People like Ana Navarro hate President Trump and they blame everything and they blame the poor dialogue and crassness in Washington and crass dialogue between right and left—they blame it all on the president, and yet really people like Ana Navarro and others on The View who shout and scream over everybody, really they’re adding to that poor dialogue. They’re setting a poor example for everyone with the sort of yelling and screaming, but the particular point we were trying to explain to her was the leaders in Venezuela are socialist. The leaders of their party identify as the socialist party. She was like, ‘No they’re thugs, they’re thugs. They’re not socialists.’ And I tried to calmly make the point to her that, well, they are socialists and they are thugs—and that’s precisely our point. When the government is controlled centrally by a few people, by one political party—the socialists—and you get central planning where you don’t have the freedom to decide what and how much to produce and consumers don’t get to choose, when a few people control things, you have much more of a susceptibility to kleptocracy, to thieves, to stealing and lying and enriching yourselves.”

Paul added that leftist anti-Trump personalities like Navarro “demean themselves” by opposing allowing “intelligent debate” on these issues.

“That’s what keeps happening [socialism failing] over and over again, and that’s what she doesn’t understand and so many on the left refuse to understand is that there is a tendency or maybe even something that is inherent to socialism that leads to thuggery,” Paul said. “People like her don’t want to see the lessons of Mao, the lessons of Stalin, the lessons of Hitler—they weren’t accidents of history, they were the natural conclusion of socialism. Maduro and Chávez are the natural conclusion to socialism. Then she was like, ‘Oh, President Trump is misusing this and saying that if the Democrats win you’ll get socialism.’ Then I said, and I don’t think she liked it, I said, ‘You know, if you vote for a socialist you might get socialism.’ And it’s like really? That sounds obvious to me. Bernie says he is a socialist—I think we’d get socialism [if he wins]. AOC says she’s a socialist. I would think we might socialism if these people ever get in charge of the government. So it’s sort of a bizarre situation, but they sort of demean themselves by being intolerant of allowing intelligent debate.”

While much of the interview focused on the issues of socialism and Sanders in particular, Paul added that the new Democrat frontrunner Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is really no different than Sanders when it comes to socialist ideology—just that she’s better at hiding it from the public than Sanders which is why she’s ascendant in the polls.

“I think there’s really not a dime’s worth of difference between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren,” Paul said. “They stand for the same policies and ultimately hers is a socialist platform also. You’re right, though, she’s like most liberals of the last several decades where they were always smart to try to hide their socialism from the public. And I think in the end, most of the major policies that have come out—Elizabeth Warren has rushed to support. So I don’t know that you can claim, maintain, or support that there’s much of a difference in policies between Bernie Sanders’ socialism and Elizabeth Warren.”

What’s particularly troubling, though, Paul said, is the evidence that socialism has won the day inside the Democrat Party as a whole. Ocasio-Cortez is now calling the shots and really running the House of Representatives now, not Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as evidenced by the Democrats’ lunging towards impeachment of President Trump. How the media and political class have gone after President Trump, versus the kid glove treatment of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, is exactly the kind of unfair double standard that Paul argues leads people to question the fairness of the political and economic system in America.

“I think they’re off the reservation now as far as impeachment goes,” Paul said. “[Pelosi] announced she was for it before she saw any transcripts of the phone call. And, the way I see it is I don’t think there’s anybody from either party who hasn’t threatened Ukraine’s aid and told them they have to investigate corruption. [Former Vice President Joe] Biden was there threatening it years ago, if they didn’t quit investigating his son’s company—the company that was paying him $50,000 a month—I think most Americans, when they hear that, just on the face of it, that some 30-year-old kid is on the board of an international company getting $50,000 a month, and his dad is traveling to Ukraine all the time, and his dad sort of tells them, ‘Guess what, you get no more money unless you fire this prosecutor.’ The prosecutor has actually now testified that he was investigating the company that was paying Hunter Biden. It just doesn’t pass the smell test. People are going to wonder and say, ‘Well, Pelosi is going to impeach the president over accusations he did something like this even though it doesn’t sound like he was willing to trade or do anything.’ But even if the accusations were accurate, they sound very similar to what Biden’s been accused of but yet nobody blinked an eye or accused Biden of doing something untoward that he should be impeached for. But I think the American people ultimately do want fairness, and they’re going to balk at treating Trump differently than Biden is treated. So if the American people perceive the actions of both to be similar, but that the Democrats are only willing to go after a Republican, I think it ends up becoming a partisan thing that I think people in the end are going to think was motivated by politics not by principle or justice.”

Paul added that this double standard is exactly why Americans on both sides of the aisle are “disturbed” by America’s political, financial, and cultural elites. He also explained that the ultimate irony of all this kleptocracy by the Bidens is that it has cleared the way for the rise of Warren, a socialist herself, and the question is whether she will be able to sufficiently hide her socialism.

“People get disturbed by it on both sides,” Paul said. “Really, they get disturbed by what’s going on. But, I think really that ultimately it’s going to be very, very hard and the irony is that while they thought this was going to bring Trump down, the irony is this is bringing Biden down. His numbers were already falling because he doesn’t seem to be on the ball as much as he used to, he doesn’t seem to have maybe what it takes to intellectually get through the questions of the day during the debates, and so I think that was already bringing him down but the association with the scandal and his son and all the money that went to his son, I think that’s what’s bringing him down. I agree with you that Elizabeth Warren is surging to the top, and the question will be: Will she run away from all the stuff she supports with Bernie, ultimately, or will the tag of socialism and the stain of socialism stick to her as well? We plan on being out there and talking about socialism over the next year and making the actual positions of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are well known and that the disaster of socialism is something our kids will hopefully know enough about to resist it.”

While he was vice president, Biden failed to stop his son Hunter Biden from cashing in on lucrative foreign business deals with Ukraine and China even as he was leading the Obama administration’s diplomatic efforts with the two countries.

President Donald Trump made it a focal point of his campaign, using Hunter Biden’s name in back-to-back rallies last week, ultimately forcing Hunter Biden to step down from his role in an investment company backed by China on Sunday.

Hunter Biden’s lawyers, however, were unclear whether he would keep his stake in the company — estimated at an investment worth millions.

But 2020 candidates are hesitant to swing at Biden, and some even appear defensive of the vice president on the issue of corruption.

The Biden campaign also fired a warning to his campaign rallies.

An aide to Biden told Bloomberg News any candidate who “calls themselves a ‘Democrat'” and repeats what the aide said were “discredited lies” about Biden and his son “would be making a profound statement about themselves.”

Sen. Warren at first stumbled by suggesting she did not approve of the idea of a vice president allowing to serve on the board of a foreign company.

“No. … I don’t know. I mean, I’d have to go back and look at the details,” she replied.

Since then, Warren dodged media attempts to answer questions about Biden and his son, pivoting back to accuse Trump of trying to dodge his own misconduct in Ukraine.

Sen. Bernie Sanders has also dodged the question, demanding “evidence” of any impropriety by the Bidens.

“I know I’m a little bit old-fashioned. I like to see the evidence before I talk about things. I read the papers and I read what I read,” Sanders said last week. “But I don’t know that I know enough at this point to make any definitive statement.”

Sen. Kamala Harris has also defended Biden, pointing instead at Trump.

“Mr. President, telling lies about Joe Biden won’t protect you from the truth. Joe has more patriotism in his pinky finger than you’ll ever have,” Harris wrote on Twitter.

Harris scored an early hit on Biden by questioning his history of opposing public bussing in public schools, even earning a bump in the polls, but the early momentum soon faded.

Attacking Biden has not worked well for other candidates as well. Former Housing Secretary Julian Castro swung at Biden, questioning memory loss in the last debate, but missed, earning scorn from pundits and Democrat voters.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand tried to score points against Biden on women’s issues, but her attack came off as self-serving, leading her to ultimately drop out of the race.

Other low-polling candidates who tried to score points against Joe Biden, such as New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio and Rep. Eric Swalwell, soon dropped out of the race after their attacks failed to resonate with primary voters.

Castro did not appear interested in hitting the Bidens again, responding to questions about Hunter Biden by criticizing Trump.

“Donald Trump is trying to use the same playbook against Joe Biden as he used against Hillary Clinton,” he said.

Mayor Pete Buttigeig began the week by vocally defending Biden on CNN, earning praise from the former Vice President.

“I’m a friend of Pete Buttigieg,” Biden told the United Food and Commercial Workers 2020 presidential forum on Sunday. “By the way, he’s a really decent guy. I turned on the television this morning and he was defending me and my family against these outrageous, lying ads of the president of the United States of America. That’s a good man.”

Sen. Cory Booker, who at times cannot resist taking gratuitous shots at Biden, has also stood up for the president.

“This is unacceptable, that if you come after Joe Biden, you’re going to have to deal with me in this case, these are baseless, unfounded, scurrilous lies,” he said in October.

But in September, Booker also questioned Hunter Biden’s actions when Trump’s attacks took form.

“I just don’t think children of vice presidents, presidents during the administration should be out there doing that,” he said.

Other candidates have promised not to allow similar behavior if they were elected president.

“I would not allow a family member, anyone in my cabinet to have a family member, to work in a position like that,” Rep. Beto O’Rourke said

Sen. Amy Klobachar promised the same.

“I can promise you right now, my own daughter, who’s only 24, does not sit on the board of a foreign company,” she said on CNN.

Andrew Yang said Hunter Biden’s role in foreign companies “certainly has a bad look to it.”

“In my mind they can wait until the term is over before serving that term,” he said. “And that’s really the way it would be under my administration.”

Tulsi Gabbard remains the wildcard.

After a devastating series of attacks against Sen. Kamala Harris in the August debate, Gabbard demonstrated she knew how to criticize the substance of her opponent’s record, without sounding gratuitous.

When asked to weigh in on the Biden’s she said that allowing a vice president’s son to sit on a corporate board “would be a poor decision to make.”

“I don’t know what went into that or how he got hired or why or what influence there was used, if any, but I think the perception is certainly a concern,” she said."

Maddie McGarvey for CNN Twelve presidential candidates take part in the Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio, on Tuesday, October 15. The candidates, from left, are US Rep. Tulsi Gabbard; businessman Tom Steyer; US Sen. Cory Booker; US Sen. Kamala Harris; US Sen. Bernie Sanders; former Vice President Joe Biden; US Sen.

Amy Klobuchar; and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro.

It was the most crowded debate stage in the history of US presidential primaries.

Twelve candidates shared the spotlight Tuesday at the Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus. The event was hosted by CNN and The New York Times on the campus of Otterbein University.

This was the fourth Democratic debate of the campaign season, and it came three and a half months before the Iowa caucuses.

The first two debates had so many candidates that they had to be split up over two nights. But the Democratic National Committee raised the polling and fundraising thresholds that candidates need to qualify.

Those thresholds will be raised once again ahead of next month's debate in Georgia, so Tuesday might have been a make-or-break night for some of the lower-polling candidates."

The people familiar told the paper that witnesses have been questioned by investigators since at least August about Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal lawyer.

Part of the questioning involves any potential role Giuliani played in an alleged conspiracy involving two of his business associates , Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were indicted on campaign finance-related charges last week.

The Journal's report builds on reporting from The New York Times l ast week that Giuliani is facing an investigation by federal prosecutors into whether his involvement with Ukraine violated federal lobbying laws.

Giuliani told CNN on Monday that he was unsure if prosecutors were looking into his work with the mayor of Kharkiv, with whom he had met on a December 2017 trip as part of his international consulting business.

""It was a security report focusing on an emergency management center which was concluded in (December) or so 2017. I have no knowledge they are looking at it but let them. Maybe they should ask me instead of leaking it (if they are doing it) and I can save them unnecessary work,"" Giuliani said.

When asked if he was aware of prosecutors looking into any other area of his Ukraine business dealings, Giuliani told CNN, ""No l don't think they are but my bank records are fine.""

The former New York mayor has faced a wave of scrutiny following the release of a whistleblower complaint that alleges Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the 2020 election and that the White House took steps to cover it up. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

The whistleblower complaint labels Giuliani a ""central figure"" in the controversy.

US officials were concerned, the whistleblower said, with Giuliani and his contacts with Ukrainian officials. The whistleblower alleges that US officials believed Giuliani was a conduit for messages between the President and officials in Kiev and that he was at the helm of a problematic ""circumvention of national security decision making processes.""

Giuliani has previously told CNN he has ""no knowledge of any of that crap"" in the complaint."

He cautioned ahead of Tuesday evening’s debate that Democrat candidates need to tell voters how they will practically implement their lofty policy proposals.

Bloomberg wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post urging Democrat candidates to explain how they would make their grandiose proposals a reality.

The former mayor said it is likely the next president will face a “closely divided Congress.” Because of that, candidates need to explain how they would implement their ideas – such as Medicare for All and their multi-trillion-dollar Green New Deal proposals.

“Rarely are the candidates asked, and more rarely still do they talk about, how they would go about achieving their goals,” Bloomberg wrote.

“The fact is: A legislative proposal is only as good as the execution plan that accompanies it. And even the best plans must be flexible enough to accommodate necessary changes, to prevent the perfect from being the enemy of the good,” he continued.

He added:

The presidential aspirants are not short on big ideas. But voters must demand they explain how they intend to move from proposing plans to actually implementing them, including passing them through Congress. Those who dodge the question by speaking of revolution and the bully pulpit aren’t up to the job.

The op-ed follows reports of Bloomberg’s rumored reconsideration of a presidential bid. While he announced his intention of staying out of the presidential race due to the “difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field” in March, Biden’s slow and steady fall has the former mayor rethinking his decision.

Bloomberg has told associates that he is considering throwing his hat in the presidential ring of Biden drops out.

“Bloomberg is in if Biden is out,” a source, described as a “New York billionaire with ties to Bloomberg,” told CNBC.

As CNBC reported:

Bloomberg has signaled he’s “still looking at” running for president, but people close him say that the only way he could even go down that path is if Biden’s fortunes suffer so much that he drops out before or during the early stages of the primary. Bloomberg could then enter the race as one of the rare moderates with enough name recognition and campaign funding to make a run. Forbes estimates his net worth at $51 billion, and he was planning to spend over $100 million on a campaign for president if he ran.

While Biden has not signaled any intention to drop out of the race, his lackluster debate performance is not expected to elevate his position in the polls. The former vice president failed to have a breakout moment during the three-hour debate and experienced at least seven gaffes, mistakenly pronouncing exponentially as “expodentially,” mentioning Roe. v Wade before correcting himself to the subject of gun sales, and claiming that people are “clipping coupons in the stock market” during a discussion on the economy:

If Bloomberg does, in fact, jump into the presidential ring in coming months, he would likely face questions surrounding his recent praise of China– particularly that Chinese Communist Party chairman Xi Jinping is “not a dictator”:

428,"Eric Bradner, Dan Merica and Gregory Krieg, CNN",,"Polls show that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is now a front-runner for the 2020 Democratic nomination. And on Tuesday night in Ohio, her 11 rivals acted like it.",2019-10-16,CNN,7 takeaways from the debate,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/16/politics/october-democratic-debate-highlights/index.html,"Westerville, Ohio (CNN) Polls show that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is now a front-runner for the 2020 Democratic nomination . And on Tuesday night in Ohio, her 11 rivals acted like it.

The party's fourth presidential debate , hosted by CNN and The New York Times, showcased the shifting dynamics of the Democratic primary. Warren was under attack all night -- though it's far from clear whether anyone dented her status at the top of the field. Former Vice President Joe Biden , the other front-runner, stayed out of the fray for much of the event -- until a late clash with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders that featured the same one-on-one, progressive-against-moderate battle that defined the 2016 Democratic contest.

And moderate candidates -- some, like South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, fighting to climb into the top tier; others, like Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, just desperate to make the next debate stage -- dropped the euphemisms and pressed their progressive foes in direct and sometimes personal terms.

Here are seven takeaways from Tuesday night's debate:

Warren under attack for the first time

JUST WATCHED Warren attacked from all sides on the debate stage Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Warren attacked from all sides on the debate stage 02:42

Warren's months-long march to the front of the polls finally put her in the position of being the most heavily targeted and scrutinized candidate on stage.

Buttigieg and Klobuchar led the charge, assailing Warren over her answers on health care.

Warren supports Sanders' proposal for ""Medicare for All"" -- replacing private insurance with everyone receiving coverage through a government-run plan. And while Sanders has acknowledged that Americans' taxes would need to increase to pay for the plan, Warren refused to say whether the middle class's taxes would go up -- instead only saying that, because deductibles, premiums and co-pays would be eliminated, overall costs would decrease.

Buttigieg accused her of dodging a yes-or-no question. ""Your signature is to have a plan for everything, except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this plan that Sen. Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in,"" he said.

Klobuchar accused Warren of being dishonest. ""We owe it to the American people to tell them where we will send the invoice,"" she said.

Warren later addressed the question of taxes, when former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke asked her -- during a discussion about Warren's proposed wealth tax and child care coverage -- whether she would raise middle-class taxes. ""No,"" she said -- but the moment was mostly lost amid cross-talk.

Bernie Sanders won the night

And it had nothing to do with what happened on stage.

In the debate's final moments, the Washington Post broke the news that New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez plans to endorse Sanders. CNN then reported that two other members of the ""Squad,"" Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, will do the same.

The pick-ups are huge. Some Democratic strategists think that outside of the Obamas, Ocasio-Cortez represents the most influential potential endorsement of the 2020 primary race.

It also comes at a key moment for Sanders. Warren's months-long ascent, fueled in part by progressives as she advocated some similar policies to Sanders, was on display Tuesday night, when the rest of the field treated her as the front-runner. If Ocasio-Cortez had supported her, it could have been the beginning of the end of Sanders' chances.

Instead, he gets a major injection of energy -- and sends the signal that he's far from done yet.

JUST WATCHED Warren takes a jab at Biden while complimenting Obama Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Warren takes a jab at Biden while complimenting Obama 01:41

For most of the night, as Warren wore the biggest target, Biden slipped into the background. That changed near the end of the debate, when the field's top tier -- Biden, Warren and Sanders -- finally unloaded on each other.

The question that loomed over their: Biden has a lengthy record -- but is it one that's in line with where the Democratic electorate is now?

It began when Biden touted his record in former President Barack Obama's administration, pressuring Republicans to vote for measures such as the federal stimulus package.

""We all have good ideas. The question is who is going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done?"" Biden said. ""And I'm not suggesting they can't, but I'm suggesting that's what we should look at.""

That's when Sanders pounced, attacking Biden -- in a moment that felt similar to the Vermont senator's 2016 debates with Hillary Clinton -- over legislation Biden had supported and Sanders opposed over the last three decades.

""Joe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what, you also got done, and I say this as a good friend,"" Sanders said. ""You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle class families all over this country. You got trade agreements like NAFTA and (trade relations) with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs.""

Then Warren jumped in.

Responding to Biden's assertion that he is best able to get things done, she pointed to her role in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Obama administration.

Seemingly miffed to be denied a share of the credit, Biden interjected, nearly shouting, ""I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it, so let's get those things straight, too.""

Warren responded by thanking Obama -- but notably omitting Biden.

""I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law,"" she said.

Trouble for Biden?

For the former vice president, fading into the background of a debate is a troubling sign because of what it suggests: that his foes view him as less of a threat than they once did.

But just as the good news had come late for Sanders, the real bad news for Biden's campaign came even later Wednesday night.

In a scheduling oddity, reports covering the third quarter of 2019 were due in to the Federal Election Commission by midnight -- an hour after the debate ended.

Biden's report revealed that his campaign ended September with just $9 million on hand. That's far short of Sanders' $33.7 million, Warren's $25.7 million and Buttigieg's $23.4 million -- and is even below California Sen. Kamala Harris' $10.5 million.

A more aggressive Buttigieg

JUST WATCHED Buttigieg to O'Rourke: I don't need lessons from you Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Buttigieg to O'Rourke: I don't need lessons from you 03:29

The South Bend, Indiana, mayor had made it obvious he planned to come out swinging. In the days before the debate, he'd launched an ad that was critical of Warren and Sanders over Medicare for All, criticized Warren's grassroots fundraising strategy for the general election as being reliant on ""pocket change,"" and attacked O'Rourke over his support for mandatory buy-backs of assault-style rifles in an interview on Snapchat's ""Good Luck America.""

The exchanges with Warren over health care might be the night's most memorable.

But he also got a chance to tout an element of his own biography -- his military service -- in clashing with Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, the only other military veteran in the field, over her call to end ""endless wars.""

""The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this President of American allies and American values,"" he said.

Buttigieg also sharply criticized O'Rourke -- at one point, in personal terms -- over the former Texas congressman's proposed mandatory buy-backs of assault-style rifles.

""You just made it clear that you don't know how this is going to take weapons off the street,"" he said. ""If you can develop the plan further, we can have a debate. But we can't wait.""

O'Rourke responded that mass shootings are a ""crisis"" and that Democrats should make the case for farther-reaching gun control measures. ""Let's decide what we are going to believe in, what we are going to achieve, and let's bring this country together in order to do that,"" he said.

Buttigieg shot back: ""The problem isn't the polls, the problem is the policy. And I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.""

""I don't care what that meant to me or my candidacy,"" O'Rourke replied. But to survivors of gun violence, and March For Our Lives, the gun control advocacy group founded by students after the Parkland, Florida, shooting last year, ""that was a slap in the face to every single one of those groups,"" he said. Moments later, the organization tweeted praise for O'Rourke's position.

Klobuchar, unleashed

With the Democratic National Committee raising its fundraising and polling thresholds for the November debate, Klobuchar walked on stage facing the real possibility that this debate could be her last.

Her response: Go hard at the Democratic primary's most ascendant candidate, Warren.

""The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done,"" she said of Warren at one point, as she criticized her support for Medicare for All.

Klobuchar's performance on Tuesday stands in stark contrast to her first three debate performances, which were more muted.

And there is a reason for that: After qualifying for the first four debates, Klobuchar is on the verge of not qualifying for the fifth Democratic debate in November. While Klobuchar has the required number of donors, she has yet to reach the polling threshold, something that her team believes she can boost with a well-reviewed debate.

Then there's the portion of her approach that's in the eye of the beholder: One of her trademarks as a candidate -- goofy humor -- continued on Tuesday night.

""Vladimir Putin is someone who has shot down planes over Ukraine, who has poisoned his opponent and we have not talked about what we need to do to protect ourselves from Russia invading our election,"" Klobuchar said. ""This wasn't meddling. That's what I do when I call my daughter on a Saturday night and ask her what she's doing.""

Yang's 'Freedom Dividend' gets an airing

Andrew Yang launched his presidential campaign in 2017 with a plan to give every American $1,000 a month to combat job losses and automation -- and very little attention from media and voters.

Almost two years later, Yang's plan for a universal basic income, which he's calling a ""freedom dividend,"" remains his signature policy proposal. But his impact on the race has increased dramatically -- a reality that was on display on Tuesday night when the candidates on stage debated a universal basic income and job losses to automation in depth on national television.

""We have a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month, it recognizes the work in our families and communities. It helps all Americans transition,"" Yang said. ""When we put the money into our hands, we can build a trickle up economy from our people, our families and our communities up. It will enable us to do the work that we want to do. This is the sort of vision in response to the fourth industrial revolution that we have to embrace.""

Yang has talked about his universal basic income at previous debates. What made Tuesday different was that other candidates -- some of whom largely ignored Yang in previous debates -- began to seriously debate automation and a basic income.

""I believe that we need to address a community being impacted by automation,"" said former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro.

""I agree with my friend Andrew Yang. Universal basic income is a good idea to help provide that security so people can make choices that they want to see,"" Gabbard said.

But what clearly cemented Yang's rise is that the debate over universal basic income got him into a direct argument with Warren, who said the issue is broader.

After the debate, Yang told CNN that Warren -- who, with Biden, is at the top of the Democratic field -- had asked him to send her details on his proposal. ""She said she wanted to see the data,"" he said."

Elizabeth Warren, said Wednesday his 2020 rival has been ""more specific and forthcoming about the number of selfies she's taken"" than about laying out details of how she'd pay for ""Medicare for All.""

""Not only is it important to have 'yes-or-no' answers to 'yes-or-no' questions at a time when people are so frustrated with Washington speak, but also there's still been no explanation for a multitrillion-dollar hole in this plan,"" the South Bend, Indiana, mayor told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""I have a lot of respect for Senator Warren, but last night she was more specific and forthcoming about the number of selfies she's taken than about how this plan is going to be funded. And that's a real problem, especially when there's a better way to deliver health care coverage to everybody.""

Buttigieg was among several Democratic presidential candidates who took aim at Warren during the fourth Democratic primary debate hosted CNN and The New York Times on Tuesday night. He has criticized Warren over her support for Medicare for All and criticized her again during the debate for not directly answering a ""yes-or-no"" question on how she would fund such a proposal.

Warren supports Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' proposed plan, which would create a national government-run health care program and eliminate the private insurance industry -- something several candidates criticized during the debate.

Buttigieg, who has fashioned himself as a centrist candidate as the Democratic Party has veered leftward, was among the Democrats onstage Tuesday night who challenged Warren, who has emerged as a front-runner in the 2020 field. The Massachusetts senator was constantly on defense throughout the debate, underscoring a marked shift in the Democratic race that has been underway for many weeks: while former Vice President Joe Biden has remained strong in the polls, the other candidates in the race clearly now see Warren as the real competition.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont by name for their support of ""Medicare for All.""

The ad -- titled ""Makes More Sense"" -- highlights Buttigieg's Medicare for All Who Want It health care plan, a middle-of-the-road approach that would not force people onto government health coverage but would offer a public option for people who choose to enroll. That is a key distinction between Buttigieg's plan and the sweeping overhaul that would be instituted under a full Medicare for All program.

The ad represents an escalation by the South Bend, Indiana, mayor's campaign, after he's mostly kept his Medicare for All critiques nameless and primarily focused on policy.

Buttigieg's ad uses reporters and media figures to describe the differences between the plans, including CNN political commentator Joe Lockhart saying, ""Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren believe that we have to force ourselves into Medicare for all, where private insurance is abolished.""

His campaign said in a news release, ""The ad highlights Pete's bold approach to health care would not kick millions of people off their private health care, and would give them the option to choose the plan that's right for their them.""

Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday met swift criticism from her 2020 Democratic rivals after she would not explicitly state that, under the ""Medicare for All"" plan she supports, many middle class families will see a tax hike.",2019-10-16,CNN,Warren comes under fire from 2020 Democratic rivals over 'Medicare for All',https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/15/politics/warren-medicare-for-all-debate/index.html,"(CNN) Elizabeth Warren got a taste of the front-runner life during a heated debate on Tuesday in Ohio , as the moderate candidates onstage bombarded her throughout the night and, during an especially pointed exchange, assailed the Massachusetts senator over her refusal to directly explain how she would fund ""Medicare for All.""

The question during the CNN/New York Times debate that set off the onslaught was a familiar one: Would Warren raise taxes on middle class Americans to pay for a single-payer health care program? Warren's response, too, was consistent with what she's said in the past -- but didn't provide a clear answer.

""My view on this and what I have committed to is, costs will go down for hard-working middle-class families,"" Warren said, again stressing that taxes on ""the wealth and big corporations"" would fulfill the bulk of the financing before pledging that she would ""not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families.""

But the stage was not satisfied. And with that, a nearly three-hour storm began -- and it was Warren most often standing under the angriest clouds.

South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg , who was aggressive throughout the night, called Warren ""evasive"" and, addressing her directly, said: ""Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this."" Sen. Amy Klobuchar , who repeatedly pivoted to Warren when asked a question, also took direct aim at her Senate colleague's murky explanation.

""We owe it to the American people,"" she said, ""to tell them where we will send the invoice.""

Sen. Bernie Sanders , who has been careful not directly criticize his progressive ally, defended Medicare for All after Buttigieg zeroed in on the policy itself -- but added, as he's stated before, that taxes would go up nearly across the board in order to pay for the plan.

""As somebody who wrote the damn bill, let's be clear: Under the Medicare for All bill I wrote, premiums are gone, copayments are gone, deductibles are gone. All out-of-pocket expenses are gone,"" Sanders said, before adding, ""But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up"" mostly for the wealthy, but also for some middle class Americans.

Sanders, as he's done on the trail, argued that the implementation of Medicare for All would, despite those tax hikes, mean that most Americans would be paying significantly less overall. Warren makes the same point, but her consistent demurrals when faced with the tax question -- on the campaign trail, when it's been posed by voters at rallies, and on the debate stage -- set up Medicare for All critics for a predictable pile-on.

But the scrap over health care was only a modest preview of what was coming for Warren, who has topped the field in a number of recent polls of early-voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire. Lower-performing rivals like former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and Sen. Kamala Harris gave the debate a feeling, at times, of being a referendum on Warren.

After the debate, Warren's campaign described the incoming volleys as more evidence of the candidate's growing stature and prospects.

""Elizabeth Warren has built momentum by running a campaign of substance, identifying problems facing the country and laying out her plans for big structural change to fix them,"" communications director Kristen Orthman said. ""She took heat tonight as a result of that momentum, but she stayed focused on what's broken and how she plans to fix it with a government and an economy that works for the people.""

Former Vice President Joe Biden was more tempered than some others in his language, but he also accused Warren of being ""vague"" in her discussion of Medicare for All and, as he livened up as the debate pushed into its third hour, claimed to the be the only one the stage who had accomplished anything ""big.""

Warren answered that suggestion with a sharply confident reminder of her work in crafting and establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

""Following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people,"" Warren recalled. ""And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, don't even try because you will never get it passed.""

Biden jumped in after Warren finished to talk about his role in seeing that it did, telling her: ""I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it, so let's get those things straight, too.""

Warren answered his aggressive claims with a deadpan: ""I am deeply grateful to President Obama,"" she said, ""who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law.""

Harris picked a more narrow line of attack, pushing Warren -- who has been critical of Facebook's ad policy, which doesn't vet candidate's claims -- to follow her lead and demand Twitter suspend President Donald Trump's account.

""Sen. Warren, I just want to say that I was surprised to hear that you did not agree with me that, on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies,"" Harris said.

Warren responded by implicitly belittling the ambition of Harris' demand: ""I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter,"" she said. ""I want to push him out of the White House. That's our job.""

When Harris continued pushing, asking Warren to ""join me in saying that his Twitter account should be shut down,"" Warren turned her down with a flat ""no.""

In a Democratic primary campaign that has yet to see a candidate rewarded for explicitly attacking a particular rival, the attempts to wallop Warren are as likely to backfire as cut her down.

O'Rourke zeroed in after the wealth tax plans by Warren and Sanders became a point of contention, with businessman Andrew Yang saying the policy ""makes a lot of sense in principle,"" but questioned whether and how it would work in practice.

""Sometimes I think that Sen. Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other,"" O'Rourke said, ""instead of lifting people up and making sure this country comes together around those solutions.""

""I'm really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I'm punitive,"" Warren said. ""Look, I don't have a beef with billionaires,"" before reprising an argument that she's been making for years: that the wealthiest Americans owed a financial -- and moral -- debt to the country that helped facilitate their success.

Ultimately, it was Sen. Cory Booker who sought to pull Warren out of the barrel and tsk-tsk his rivals over both the tone and text of their criticisms.

""I have seen this script before. It didn't work in 2016 and it will be a disaster for us in 2020,"" Booker said, warning Democrats against ""tearing each other down because we have different plans."""

Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday challenged her Democratic primary rivals to release the names of contributors and fundraisers with influential positions on their campaigns, while pledging to champion legislation that would effectively disqualify big-dollar donors from being appointed to cushy diplomatic posts.

The requests were written into a series of mostly new proposed campaign finance restrictions, which would ban corporate PACs from donating to federal candidates and make it illegal for certain super PACs to be run by operatives with professional or personal ties to the candidate they're backing.

Now firmly among the front-runners for the Democratic presidential nomination, Warren has increasingly centered her campaign on a broad anti-corruption platform . In past rollouts, she promised to forbid lobbyists from making political contributions, acting as bundlers or hosting fundraisers for candidates. Former top federal officials -- including presidents, vice presidents, members of Congress, judges, and cabinet secretaries -- would also be permanently prohibited from taking lobbying jobs.

While Warren does not name any of her competitors in her Medium post, the new call for campaigns to ""disclose any donor or fundraiser who has a special title on their campaign, including national and regional finance committee members and bundler designations"" is an apparent nudge to a number of top rivals, like former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris, who all regularly attend big-dollar fundraising events.

Warren's call to cut off the donor-to-ambassador pipeline, which she acknowledges has been common practice in both Republican and Democratic administrations, comes with increased resonance now that President Donald Trump's EU ambassador, Gordon Sondland , a Republican megadonor who gave $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee, has emerged as a key figure in the Ukraine scandal.

Bernie Sanders on how his sweeping health care plan -- which Warren has endorsed -- would be paid for.

""She's reviewing the revenue options suggested by the 2016 Bernie campaign along with other revenue options. But she will only support pay-fors that meet the principles she has laid out in multiple debates,"" a Warren campaign aide said in a statement provided to CNN.

The campaign aide also said that the total cost of Medicare for All is unknown and that estimates vary by trillions of dollars. They did not provide details on what ""other revenue options"" the campaign is studying, and declined to comment on whether Warren may eventually put out her own details on paying for Medicare for All.

A new study by the Urban Institute , released Wednesday, said that federal spending on health care would increase by roughly $34 trillion under a single-payer plan similar to Medicare for All. That's in line with earlier studies that pegged the cost at around $32 trillion.

While Sanders has not detailed how he would raise the revenue needed to pay for Medicare for All, he included a variety of options when he released his 2016 campaign proposal and his updated bill in April. Among those listed in his most recent iteration are a 4% levy on employees, exempting the first $29,000 in income for a family of four. He also suggests imposing new taxes on employers, hiking the marginal tax rate on those making above $10 million, boosting the estate tax and establishing a wealth tax.

Warren's campaign statement comes on the heels of a contentious presidential debate Tuesday night in Ohio, where Warren was asked no less than half a dozen times on stage about whether Sanders' signature health care platform would raise taxes on the middle class and how she would like to pay for it.

Every time, the Massachusetts Democrat -- standing squarely center stage as a new front-runner in the 2020 Democratic race for President -- refused to state that taxes would, in fact, go up for some Americans under her colleague's plan. Instead, she stuck to a well-rehearsed response about how costs would go up for corporations and the wealthy and come down for middle class families. She pledged that as President, she would not sign a health care bill into law unless it lowered costs for average Americans.

Sanders has also stressed that while he would impose taxes on the middle class, they would see their overall costs go down because they would no longer have to pay premiums, deductibles or co-payments when they seek care.

Warren's repeated dodges on questions about whether Medicare for All would result in higher taxes are notably out of character for the senator, whose candidacy for the White House has gained steady political momentum in large part thanks to her abundance of policy plans and a knack for explaining and advocating for those ideas clearly out on the campaign trail.

Less than four months out from the Iowa caucuses, Warren's support for Medicare for All has stood out as a rarity. Even as she has unveiled policy plans at a rapid clip since launching her campaign on New Year's Eve, on the issue of health care, Warren has chosen to hold back from releasing a proposal of her own. Instead, she has stuck to publicly backing Sanders' Medicare for All -- a bill that she co-sponsored in the Senate -- and has not said that she will release a comprehensive health care plan of her own in the 2020 race.

""I'm with Bernie,"" Warren has previously said when asked about her vision on health care.

Tuesday's debate laid bare the political risks of Warren's backing of Sanders' Medicare for All, and foreshadowed that she is likely to continue confronting questions and criticism about tax hikes that could result from Sanders' proposal.

South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg summed up Warren's predicament this way: ""Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this."" Former Vice President Joe Biden accused Warren of being ""vague.""

Minnesota Sen. Klobuchar also joined the chorus, imploring her Senate colleague to acknowledge what Sanders himself had said earlier in the evening: ""I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up.""

""At least Bernie is being honest here, saying how he's going to pay for this -- taxes are going to go up,"" Klobuchar said. ""Sorry Elizabeth, you haven't said that. We owe it to the American people to tell them where we will send the invoice.""

The grilling continued well after the debate ended. In an interview with CNN anchors and analysts later that spanned close to 20 minutes, Warren was again pressed multiple times to acknowledge that Sanders' Medicare for All plan would result in tax hikes for some American families. Once again, she stuck to her script.

""My commitment is: I will not sign a bill into law that raises costs on middle class families,"" Warren said.

There have been earlier signs that Warren and her campaign were leaving open wiggle room on Medicare for All.

At a town hall in Keene, New Hampshire, last month, Warren referred to Medicare for All as a ""framework,"" saying: ""Right now, what we've got in Medicare for All is a framework and it doesn't have the details.""

The senator's senior adviser on the campaign, Joe Rospars , echoed that sentiment in a recent podcast interview, saying that some significant details have yet to be filled in on Sanders' Medicare for All plan.

""The question of the pay-for is: There's still a lot of details still to be filled in, in terms of both Bernie's bill that's out there but also the other versions of it, other candidates have their specific plans,"" Rospars said.

A veteran of Barack Obama's presidential campaigns, Rospars also said that he believes it's the ""overall cost"" of Medicare for All that most voters are focused on.

""I think there's a kind of disingenuousness to the — well, let's talk about taxes part of it,"" he said."

It was a rough-and-tumble welcome in the arena for a candidate who has gamely sidestepped attacks in previous debates. But at the CNN/New York Times debate Tuesday night in the crucial swing state of Ohio, the Massachusetts senator was constantly on defense driving her central argument that Democrats must ""dream big"" and ""fight hard."" All the fire sent in Warren's direction at Otterbein University underscored a marked shift in the Democratic race that has been underway for many weeks: while former Vice President Joe Biden has remained strong in the polls, the other candidates in the race clearly now see Warren as the real competition.

It was one of the first times Warren had to face a barrage of critiques from her Democratic competitors, navigating many of the critical comments usually aimed toward Biden or Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

It was the moderates in the race who targeted the newly minted front-runner the most. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg set that aggressive tone from the opening moments of the debate as he sought to seize the centrist lane within the Democratic field. Challenging Warren on her refusal to answer a yes-or-no questions about whether her plan would lead to tax hikes from the middle class, he said her evasiveness embodied the very reason why Americans are so frustrated with Washington.

""Your signature is to have a plan for everything, except this,"" Buttigieg said to Warren. ""No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this plan that Sen. Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.""

In a strong performance, Buttigieg repeatedly argued that Democrats would not be able to sell some of Warren's more liberal ideas -- namely ""Medicare for All"" -- to the broader universe of voters that the party must sway to win the White House.

""I don't understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage is to obliterate private plans,"" Buttigieg said to Warren. ""We're competing to be president for the day after Trump. Our country will be polarized, more than now. After everything we have been through, after everything we are about to go through, this country will be more divided. Why divide this country over health care when there's a better way to deliver coverage for all?""

Warren did not back down, but at times seemed surprised by the force of the attacks against her -- even from the normally mild-mannered former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke who accused her of embracing a philosophy that was punitive.

""Look, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,"" she said.

Buttigieg's arguments were often amplified by Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who also leaned heavily on her Midwestern roots to argue that Warren and Sanders have driven the party too far to the left. In one tense exchange, the Minnesota senator referred to ""Medicare for All"" -- a proposal that was crafted by Sanders and endorsed by Warren -- as a ""pipe-dream.""

""The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done,"" Klobuchar said.

""At least Bernie is being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this -- and that taxes are going to go up,"" she added. ""We owe it to the American people to tell them where we will send the invoice.""

At another point Warren was repeatedly badgered by California Sen. Kamala Harris, who tried to force her into agreeing with Harris's proposal that Trump should be thrown off Twitter. It was then that Warren showed a touch of exasperation.

""Look, I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter, I want to push him out of the White House,"" Warren said.

Biden touts record, Sanders thanks well-wishers

While he often receded into the background on Tuesday night, Biden argued that he had done bigger things than anyone else on stage, citing the Violence Against Women Act as one example.

Though he did not take on Warren as aggressively as some of the others, he tried at one point to take credit for getting the votes in Congress to make her idea for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau a reality. ""I got votes for that bill,"" Biden said, referring to the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act that established the bureau. ""I convinced people to vote for it, so let's get those things straight too,"" he said.

Pushing back on that idea, Warren offered her thanks to Biden's then-boss, President Barack Obama and everyone else who helped create the agency -- pointedly not mentioning the former vice president.

""I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law,"" Warren said.

Biden, grinning as he stood beside her, graciously offered a compliment: ""You did a hell of a job in your job,"" he said to her.

""Thank you,"" she replied.

When the conversation turned to the age of the three leading candidates -- Biden, Sanders and Warren -- who are all in their 70s, Biden also sought to frame his age as an asset. He promised to release his health records, along with some two decades of his tax information.

""Look, one of the reasons I'm running is because of my age and my experience,"" Biden said. ""With it comes wisdom. We need someone to take office this time around who on day one can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders from Putin to our allies, and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track.""

Sanders, who was back on the trail for the first time since his heart attack, tried to allay any concerns about his stamina by stating that he's ""healthy"" and ""feeling great."" The 78-year-old also offered his thanks for the well wishes he has received over the past two weeks.

""Let me take this moment if I might to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes,"" he said. ""And I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and I'm so happy to be back here with you this evening.""

Gabbard spars with Buttigieg

Facing the Democratic Party's increasingly difficult threshold to make the next debate in Georgia, some of the lower tier candidates clearly knew that they needed to generate a jolt of energy for their campaigns on Tuesday night. But the only candidate at that level who drew notice was Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii.

Gabbard, an Iraq War veteran who served in the Army, has called for US troops to leave Syria and she sparred with Buttigieg -- the only other veteran on the stage -- over US engagement in that conflict.

The Hawaii congresswoman criticized Trump's sudden decision to abandon Kurdish forces near the northern Syrian border -- a move that essentially opened the door for a Turkish military offensive against the longtime US allies. She described the ""slaughter of Kurds"" by Turkey as a consequence of ""the regime-change war that we've been waging in Syria.""

""Donald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hands -- but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime-change war in Syria that started in 2011,"" Gabbard said, ""along with many in the mainstream media, who have been championing and cheerleading this regime-change war.""

Buttigieg, who served in the Navy Reserve, told Gabbard she was ""dead wrong.""

""The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this President of American allies and American values,"" Buttigieg said.

He noted that he did not support going into Iraq and believes that the US should get out of Afghanistan, but said it was also the case that ""a small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we're seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS.""

""When I was deployed I knew one of the things keeping me safe was the flag on my shoulder represented a country that kept its word,"" Buttigieg said. ""You take that away, it takes away what makes America America."""

Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are riding waves of small donations. Billionaire Tom Steyer plowed eye-popping sums into his presidential campaign. And one White House contender reported raising just $5 during an entire three-month period. That's not a typo: yes, $5.

Here's a look at some of the key takeaways from third-quarter reports Democratic candidates just filed with federal election regulators:

Joe Biden burned through his money

Biden burned through his campaign donations over the summer -- spending more money than he took in and leaving him with just a fraction of the cash available to several of his better-funded rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Biden's campaign entered October with $8.98 million remaining in its bank account, after spending more than $17.6 million during the July-to-September quarter.

Biden raised nearly $15.7 million during the quarter, according to a report filed by his campaign late Tuesday, shortly after the conclusion of the Democratic presidential debate in Westerville, Ohio, sponsored by CNN and The New York Times.

Biden's cash position a little more than three months before the Iowa caucuses puts him at a big financial disadvantage to rivals such as Sanders, who reported having $33.7 million stockpiled for the primary slog ahead.

Two other Democratic presidential candidates -- Warren and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg -- have each stockpiled more than $20 million.

What's Biden spending money on? One-quarter of Biden's spending in the three-month period went to payroll, his filings show. His campaign also spent more than $920,000 on private planes.

Speaking to reporters Tuesday night following the debate, Biden's aides downplayed the campaign's financial hurdles.

""We've always said that we think this race is going to be a dog fight, that it's going to go long,"" campaign spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield said. ""We are 100% confident that we have what we need to run our race.""

Small donations add up for Sanders, Warren

Sanders relied on small-dollar donations for about 60% of his contributions over the summer -- giving him a pool of donors to tap repeatedly before they hit legal contribution limits.

Nearly $15 million -- or about 61% -- of the money Warren raised from individual contributors during the July-to-September fundraising quarter came from donors who donated $200 or less to the senator's presidential campaign. That helped her post one of the biggest fundraising hauls in the crowded field of Democrats vying to face President Donald Trump next year.

By comparison, small donations accounted for less than a third of Biden's donors.

Warren and Sanders, who represent the ultra-progressive wing of their party, swore off big-dollar fundraising in their campaigns for the Democratic presidential nomination, and their financial strength underscores the enthusiasm of online donors in the 2020 election.

They both outraised Biden and Buttigieg -- candidates who have relied, in part, on larger donors to fuel their White House ambitions.

""The concept is now proven: Candidates who want to focus on the people's agenda and be fueled by the people can totally succeed,"" Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and a Warren supporter, told CNN this week. ""That's a sea change.""

Warren recently promised to go further and forgo high-dollar fundraisers in the general election should she win the nomination, a stance that drew sharp criticism from Buttigieg.

""We're not going to beat Donald Trump with pocket change,"" he told Snapchat host Peter Hamby this week.

Staying power for Buttigieg, too

Buttigieg also spent heavily in the July-to-September period -- as he raced to assemble a staff of more than 300 nationally and build a ground game in Iowa ahead of the February 3 caucuses.

He raised a solid $19.1 million during the third quarter -- falling behind only Sanders and Warren. Despite his heavy spending, Buttigieg's strong fundraising over the course of the year has left him flush with cash. He started October with nearly $23.4 million available in his campaign accounts.

His campaign attracted some bold-faced donors in recent months, including designer Isaac Mizrahi and actresses Alyssa Milano and Jennifer Garner.

But here's a sobering statistic for Buttigieg and the entire Democratic field: Trump's campaign committee started October with $83.2 million in leftover funds. That's more cash on hand than held by the three top Democratic fundraisers combined.

Self-funding candidates

Steyer plowed a staggering $47.6 million of his hedge-fund fortune into his longshot bid for the White House, filings show. Other contributors donated $2 million, helping him fulfill the minimum donor threshold set by the Democratic National Committee to join Tuesday's debate.

Steyer is not the only self-funder in the race.

Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney continues to put his own money into the race. He donated $400,000 of his own funds to the campaign in the third quarter of this year.

How low can you go?

Among the 12 Democratic candidates who faced off on Tuesday night's debate stage, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro faces the biggest financial peril. The former mayor of San Antonio, Texas, raised nearly $3.5 million, but had just $672,000 remaining in his bank account at the end of September.

Former Reps. Beto O'Rourke of Texas and Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii had $3.3 million and $2.1 million, respectively, remaining in their bank accounts. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who also joined Tuesday's debate and made forceful attacks on Warren, had nearly $3.7 million left over in her campaign accounts.

Way, way back in the fundraising pack: Wayne Messam, the Miramar, Florida, mayor who has never gained traction in the Democratic presidential nomination.

His campaign reported receipts of exactly $5 in the July-to-September fundraising period in its filing with the Federal Election Commission. And because federal law doesn't require candidates to report details on donors who provide $200 or less to a campaign, it's hard to tell who provided the money. (Messam has had to correct his filings in the past; earlier this year he filed an amended report after mistakenly reporting he had raised nearly twice as much as he had actually collected.)

Tuesday's reports show the Democrat still had a little more than $31,000 remaining in his campaign's bank account.

(CNN) President Donald Trump's ears must have been burning as Democrats met in Ohio at the most crowded presidential debate in US history on Tuesday.

The 12 candidates at the CNN/New York Times debate conjured up visions of a vastly different America should they evict him from the White House in 2020. They'd reverse Trump's erratic, ""America First"" twists and turns, and restore the US leadership in the world -- somehow. But as the heated exchanges on health care, tax and billionaires showed, the Democratic Party still doesn't know how far left it wants to go.

Who won and lost a debate often takes a few days to become clear as viral moments ignite on social media and voters chew over the post-game analysis. But the early money suggests that this debate will not shake up the wider shape of the race. Former Vice President Joe Biden is a wobbly front runner. Elizabeth Warren has joined him in the top tier (and attacks that she faced on Tuesday night -- the most withering of her career -- show that the rest of the field knows it.)

While some outsiders did well -- like 30-something Pete Buttigieg and centrist Senator Amy Klobuchar, who brought sharp knives for Warren -- everyone else is still struggling to get a look in.

Four takeaways that will shape the campaign

The shadow of impeachment

Joe Biden, reaching for gravitas, said Trump's presidency was ""the most corrupt in modern history and all of our history."" Kamala Harris said the President had ""committed crimes in plain sight."" Elizabeth Warren said this was ""bigger than politics."" Whatever happens with the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump will tear America even further apart. And if one of the men or women on stage beats him at the polls, they'll end up with the job of trying to put it back together.

What about the Kurds?

All of the candidates agreed Trump was wrong to abruptly remove US troops from the side of Kurdish allies in Syria. But there was a strong isolationist strain onstage, in keeping with the mood of a nation exhausted by foreign wars. Co-frontrunner Warren did not quarrel with Trump's instinct to bring troops home, just with how he's doing it. ""I think we want to get out of the Middle East. I do think we should do it responsibly,"" she said. Until further notice, that is America's message to the rest of the world.

So that's what it's like to be a front-runner

Elizabeth Warren now knows what it's like to have a target on her back. Her rise to effective co-front-runner status exposed her to attacks from all sides on Tuesday. Both Buttigieg and Klobuchar piled on -- seeking to grab the middle ground of many Democrats who fear Warren and Sanders are too left wing. ""The difference between a plan and a pipedream is something you can actually get done,"" said Klobuchar, desperate for a viral moment as she struggles to reach polling thresholds to get her into the next debate.

In one of the most electric moments of the campaign, Biden and Warren -- the two most likely nominees -- clashed directly for the first time.

What heart attack?

Those two stents inserted into one of Bernie Sanders' arteries did the trick. The Vermont senator was ""feeling great"" and keen to wrest the debate away from Trump-bashing and back to his wheelhouse: health care, student debt and getting rid of billionaires. Sanders supporters will be relieved. But millions of moderate Americans watching at home might be more concerned at his frank admission that taxes will go up to pay for his ambitious social reforms.

Shameful. Shameful!

That was Biden letting off steam at Trump's decision to let Syria roll into northeastern Syria at the expense of America's Kurdish allies. The former vice president has much to vent about the President.

Brexit interlude

There's a generally held view of the European Union as an 11th hour decision-maker, working its way out of difficulties with late-night summits fueled by dozens of cups of coffee and pastries, and prime ministers and presidents only staggering out after midnight to announce a breakthrough.

Sometimes that really is what happens (it's also not uncommon for heads of state convening in Brussels to nip out for frites and a beer during negotiating breaks) but that's not how the EU likes to do things.

In fact, the European Council prefers to have its agenda set two weeks ahead of each summit. That gives the Commission -- its executive body -- time to analyze everything and make recommendations to member states, who also have to prepare. But Brexit is no ordinary agenda item.

This month, the EU has blown through one self-imposed deadline after another, as they try to settle the conditions of a UK exit from the union, before heads of government start turning up in Brussels. On Tuesday, they missed another deadline. As things stand now, no one will have time to digest any Brexit deal before the Thursday summit -- which could mean more stale pastries, fries and head-scratching in the middle of the night, instead.

Who said it? Debate edition

""I don't need lessons from you on courage — political or personal.""

""That is dead wrong.""

""It didn't work in 2016 and it will be a disaster for us in 2020.""

What good is a 12-person debate anyway?

Glad you asked.

The US electoral map is so vast that most Americans only see presidential candidates on TV, so these events are necessary for Democratic officials to build enthusiasm among voters, reaching tens of millions of viewers -- and not just Democrats. And the crowded field offers more than a soundbite fest — it fleshes out a broader divide between liberal and moderate positions that grassroots voters must adjudicate before choosing a candidate.

There is something quintessentially American about opening the White House race to everyone. The last two US presidents have been a rookie senator from Illinois and a businessman from New York with almost no political experience between them and little in common. Debates are part of a process that must be sufficiently elastic to accommodate sharp shifts in public opinion over a four year cycle.

In a populist age, party elites fear charges of dictating voters' choices, and the field will narrow soon enough anyway. When it does, the debates will have been good practice for the eventual Democratic nominee, who must debate Donald Trump a year from now. Whether they're the right way to pick a decent president is a whole other ballgame."

(CNN) In Tuesday night's Democratic presidential debate, I'm afraid most of the candidates blended into the stage for me at some point. But that doesn't mean there wasn't a star among them. Here's how each candidate performed:

Bernie Sanders: A

Throughout the three-hour event, Sen. Sanders was consistently sharper than normal, and he outperformed the others, especially Elizabeth Warren, when explaining the financials of his healthcare plan. I liked his attitude about his health: we can judge it by watching him take the campaign by storm. He was the star of the evening.

Sanders remained firm and defiant when it was called for, asserting that nobody can trust our foreign policy because President Donald Trump is unpredictable. And when Joe Biden heated up toward the end of the debate, saying,""I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done,"" Sanders was ready to put things in perspective by replying: ""You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA (The North American Free Trade Agreement) and PNTR (Permanent Normal Trade Relations), with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs.""

Overall, Sanders' nonverbal communication -- typically hyper with lots of hand-waving -- was reined in, and that served him well. His animation was kept to a minimum, which was smart and effective.

Kamala Harris: A-

Sen. Harris flourished by doing the opposite of Sanders. Rather than being restrained, she brought a bit more energy to her debate performance, which she needed.

On the topic of abortion, nobody was more powerful than Harris, who declared: ""Women are the majority of the population in this country. People need to keep their hands off of women's bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives."" And Harris got the better of Elizabeth Warren when asking Warren to support the suspension of President Trump's Twitter account.

But a couple of stories didn't land. For instance, when debating a tax credit to close the income gap, Harris told a childhood anecdote about her mom sitting at the kitchen table wondering how to ""make it all work."" In the past, Harris has hit home runs with these personal stories, but this time around, she had none that were especially memorable.

Pete Buttigieg: B

Mayor Pete was pretty effective in policy arguments. He provided several options for depoliticizing the Supreme Court, and more than held his own on health care and gun control. Buttigieg also won most of the direct skirmishes he entered with other candidates. He got the best of Tulsi Gabbard when discussing Syria and keeping our military commitments. He called out Elizabeth Warren when she failed to satisfactorily explain how she'd pay for Medicare for All.

But then he slipped up when he made a back-and-forth about gun control with Beto O'Rourke needlessly personal. After O'Rourke remarked that policymakers should ""lead and not be limited by the polls and the consultants and the focus groups,"" Buttigieg retorted: ""I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal."" The remark seemed to come from left field. Mayor Pete responded as if he was called a coward, but that simply wasn't the case.

Phantom attacks like these happen often in competitive debates when expectations of an opponent's arguments don't always match the reality of what has been said. It was an unfortunate miscalculation by Buttigieg.

Cory Booker: B

Sen. Booker had a good tone throughout the evening. He was conversational, which is what I teach my students to strive for. Booker was also solid on content, consistently taking arguments one step further, like when he mentioned how anti-abortion laws disproportionately affect low-income women and the need to talk about child poverty when discussing tax systems.

On the downside, Booker focused too much energy on chastising everyone else over their tones and argument style when talking to one another (he was right, but then he overplayed his hand and his criticism seemed canned). Speaking of canned, what was the joke about Bernie Sanders being a fan of medical marijuana? Round peg, meet square hole.

Andrew Yang: B-

Bold ideas suit him well. While Yang's defense of his Freedom Dividend (a universal basic income of $1,000 a month) was lacking in support in this debate, he made up for it by defending other unconventional ideas. Yang floated the idea of decriminalizing opioids, which impressively got support from O'Rourke. Yang was smart to point out that Elizabeth Warren's plan to implement a wealth tax has been tried. ""The problem is that it's been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all those countries ended up repealing it, because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they'd projected,"" Yang said.

There were a few arguments where Yang was less successful. Booker overshadowed him on the topic of breaking up large tech companies. While Yang expressed skepticism over some benefits of breaking them up, Booker pointed out that the issue is not just competition, but that these large monopolies ""undermine our democracy.""

Yang also could use a bit more practice finishing his arguments. While he made a good point that our data should be treated as our property, his analysis was incomplete. Yang needed to more fully explain what having control of our data would mean for Americans.

Julian Castro: C+

He all but disappeared in parts of the debate, so it was difficult for him to climb the grading scale. However, Castro had some on-point analysis when discussing why communities don't want cops coming to their house under the guise of confiscating assault weapons. This approach was bold but risky. It could work against him if his criticism of weapon confiscation is interpreted as anti-police.

Elizabeth Warren: C

Sen. Warren needs to answer the questions. She is simply too smart to ignore the topic she is being asked to address -- especially when she's asked the same thing multiple times. Should Trump's Twitter account be suspended? I personally don't know -- and neither, it seems, does Warren. How is she planning to pay for Medicare for all? Again, she left us wondering,

Warren also came across as petty by implying it was not Biden but President Obama who should be credited with helping some of her bills become laws during the Obama administration.

Amy Klobuchar: C

While I found her delivery to be less than optimal at times, Klobuchar had some good points. She spoke thoughtfully on Roe v. Wade, taking on Big Pharma and income inequality.

Unfortunately, Klobuchar got caught in an awkward nonverbal moment when Castro was speaking on the topic of monopolies and the camera panned over to her. Her blank expression reminded me of when I catch a student on a cell phone during class. It's a good reminder to look engaged at all times -- you never know when you'll be in the spotlight.

If I could give her one piece of advice it would be to please stop using the scripted jokes. No one is laughing.

Beto O'Rourke: C

O'Rourke was simply average the entire time. He argued better than he did during the first debate, but was an expected let-down from his last debate. Unfortunately, the issue of guns, which he has made a central point of his campaign, was probably the worst part of his performance on Tuesday. O'Rourke needed more evidence to support his belief that owners of AR-15s and AK-47s will voluntarily give up their weapons under an assault rifle ban.

Joe Biden: C-

The best part of former Vice President Joe Biden's debate came toward the end when he highlighted his accomplishments. While still not as smooth as it could have been, he made a convincing argument: ""I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done, from the Violence Against Women Act to making sure that we pass the Affordable Care Act to being in a position where we, in fact, took almost a $90 billion act that kept us from going into a depression...""

Unfortunately, this came a bit late in the night. And for every good answer, Biden had multiple slipups. Examples include whatever this means: ""And lastly, and I apologize for going on, but lastly, what is happening in Iraq is going to -- I mean, excuse me, in Afghanistan, as well as all the way over to Syria, we have ISIS that's going to come here ..."" Once you've fumbled that much, you've lost the audience.

Biden needs to take his own advice and eliminate some of the clutter in his mind when he's answering questions. As he said in the debate, ""And this is one of the reasons why these debates are kind of crazy, because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given."" Exactly.

Tulsi Gabbard: D

Congresswoman Gabbard probably put off a lot of people with her responses. Drawing from the Republican playbook, she complained about the mainstream media and pointed out that she disagreed with Hillary Clinton on many issues. At the end of the night, when candidates were asked to explain a surprising friendship, Gabbard talked about her relationship with Republican Trey Gowdy. The same Trey Gowdy that Trump tried to hire for his impeachment defense team

However, my favorite part of the whole debate was when apparently Gabbard tried to take over the moderators' jobs and pose a question to the other candidates. She was quickly shut down when moderator Erin Burnett jumped in and announced a commercial break.

Tom Steyer: D

This was Steyer's first debate, and I had no problem with any of his answers, so in that regard, it was a success. But on public speaking 101, he failed. Have you ever met a person who never breaks eye contact until you feel uncomfortable? Steyer's nonstop eye contact with the camera made me feel the need to look away. It looked totally unnatural. We can only hope that he watches himself back and makes a note to blink in the next debate."
440,"Paul R. La Monica, CNN Business",,Is the market's love affair with Big Tech finally coming to an end? That might be a stretch. But there's a growing chorus on Wall Street for investors to look beyond the FANG momentum plays and more toward value stocks.,2019-10-16,CNN,Invest like Warren Buffett — Is this value's time to finally shine?,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/16/investing/value-stocks-growth/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Is the market's love affair with Big Tech finally coming to an end? That might be a stretch. But there's a growing chorus on Wall Street for investors to look beyond the FANG momentum plays and more toward value stocks.

In other words, investors are pulling a Warren Buffett.

Companies in sectors like banking, energy and health care have started to mount a comeback after lagging growth stocks for the past half-decade. Those sectors typically don't trade at prices as high asand other large tech firms.

Theis up about 40% in the last five years while thehas soared more than 80% during the same time frame. But value stocks have narrowed the gap considerably as of late. The value index is up nearly 18.5% this year — not far behind the gain of 20% for the growth index.

Materials, industrials, energy and tech firms will probably show the strongest earnings growth in 2020, predicts John Augustine, chief investment officer for Huntington Private Bank — especially if the US and China reach a trade deal and the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates to keep the economy growing.

Slower global growth could make value more attractive

With the exception of tech, Augustine cites three other sectors that tend to trade at more reasonable prices than growth stocks. But even within tech, Augustine points out that much of the earnings growth for next year may come from semiconductor stocks, which are typically a lot cheaper than cloud software, social networking and e-commerce companies.

""If these earnings projections hold up, we could see more investors start to shift from growth to value,"" Augustine told CNN Business. ""These are all cyclical companies and could have a strong 2020.""

But there's more to value than cyclical companies. Many investors also flock to slower-growth but dependable companies that pay big dividend yields. That trend should continue now that interest rates are expected to fall further in the United States, and yields for Japanese debt and many government bonds in Europe have fallen into negative territory.

Coca-Cola KO Verizon VZ So Dow components likeandand other high-yielding stocks will become increasingly attractive.

""Given that companies in defensive sectors like utilities, consumer goods, telecommunications and real estate generally sport higher dividend yields than their cyclical counterparts, falling interest rates have also helped drive defensive stock leadership,"" said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research for FTSE Russell, in a recent report.

Growth — but at the right price

Still, some fund managers warn investors to not bail on momentum tech darlings just yet.

Brian Macauley, a portfolio manager with Broad Run Investment Management, which subadvises the Hennessy Focus Fund, told CNN Business he'd be wary of many big banks and materials companies due to concerns about slowing global growth. Just because a stock looks like a bargain does not mean that it can't fall further.

""Some stocks are cheap for the right reasons,"" Macauley said.

Booking Holdings BKNG CarMax KMX Keurig Dr Pepper KDP That's why he prefers to buy stocks that he thinks offer growth at a reasonable price — companies that may not have bargain basement valuations but can justify their price because of solid prospects. He likes Priceline owner, used car dealerandfor example.

Encore Capital Group ECPG Brookfield Asset Management BAM Charles Schwab SCHW He's not completely shunning traditional value stocks either. Macauley also owns specialty finance firms such as debt recovery firm, real estate giantand brokerage giant

Microsoft MSFT Oracle ORCL Damon Ficklin, a portfolio manager with Polen Capital, said he's also prioritizing growth over value. But it's nice to have a mix of both, which is why some of his top tech holdings are companies that trade at lower valuations and also pay dividends, such asand

""It's fine to delineate your differences with other primary candidates. But the way we do it matters. It cannot be personal attacks, tearing folks down, doing so in a way that wounds us as a party,"" Booker told CNN's John Berman on ""New Day."" ""At the end of the day, we have to show that unity that's necessary to develop the kind of strength it needs to beat Donald Trump.""

""If we can't unify the Democratic Party, you're not going to have a great success in even trying to unify the nation,"" the New Jersey senator added.

On Tuesday night, Booker joined 11 other candidates at the fourth Democratic primary debate, hosted by CNN and The New York Times in Westerville, Ohio. The debate was marked by increasing aggressiveness among the different candidates, who are all looking to break out as the contest inches toward 2020. In particular, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren faced attacks by a number of her rivals who were looking to take shots at her now that she is a front-runner in the contest. At one point during the debate, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg accused Warren of dodging a yes-or-no question, and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar accused her of being dishonest.

""Last night (Warren) was more specific and forthcoming about the number of selfies she's taken than about how (her 'Medicare for All') plan is going to be funded,"" Buttigieg told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day"" Wednesday.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii walked onstage here at Otterbein University with a stark reality looming: This could be their last debate, as none of them have yet qualified for the November contest.

To make the November debate stage, candidates will have to reach 3% in at least four Democratic National Committee-approved polls of Democratic voters nationally or in one of the four early-voting states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina -- and raise money from 165,000 separate donors -- including a minimum of 600 donors each in at least 20 states or territories.

The reality for the four Democrats on the bubble is that none of them are that close to making the fourth debate. All the candidates have the needed donors, but only O'Rourke and Klobuchar have one of the needed polls.

While the four candidates enter the coming weeks of campaigning with a shared goal of appearing on the November stage, the distinctly different Democrats used different methods Tuesday night to set themselves apart.

Where Klobuchar was aggressive and direct, Castro -- who had been forceful in earlier contests -- was more muted and attacked less. Where Gabbard looked to score points by hitting her opponents at the end of nearly all of her answers, O'Rourke tried to be more selective in when to strike at his opponents.

The varying approaches highlight not only different political stances among the Democrats, but also divergent strategies on how each believed they will be able to drum up enough support to make the next debate.

Time for a 'reality check'

Klobuchar is the candidate who made the most notable change from her past appearances. In the first three debates, she was more muted, operating like she was alone on the stage and there only to make her particular policy points. On Tuesday, however, Klobuchar -- from the outset -- used her time to press Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, taking on the liberal lawmaker as a way to touting her own moderate bona fides.

Klobuchar accused Warren, now a front-runner in the primary contest, of being dishonest.

""We owe it to the American people to tell them where we will send the invoice,"" she said of Warren's continued dodge on whether middle-class taxes will go up to pay for the single-payer ""Medicare for All"" proposal she backs.

When Warren suggested that people onstage who disagree with her want to protect billionaires, Klobuchar shot back.

""I want to give a reality check to Elizabeth because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires,"" she said. ""Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires,"" she added, referring to businessman Tom Steyer.

Then she looked to undercut Warren's central argument: that she is in the race to fight for regular people, a suggestion that others are not.

""I think simply because you have different ideas doesn't mean you're fighting for regular people,"" Klobuchar replied. ""I wouldn't even be up on this stage if it wasn't for unions and the dignity of work.""

The performance was at a speed that few watching the earlier debates had seen from Klobuchar.

""Amy made the clearest case tonight,"" said Christina Reynolds, a top staffer at Emily's List and former aide to Hillary Clinton. ""She looked at it and said, 'I'm going to make the clear case for being the moderate candidate.' .... That's her case. And she made that case really well.""

While Klobuchar denied that she had been any different on Tuesday night -- ""I have been literally the same person from the beginning. This debate was longer and I got more airtime and I had more of a chance to do it,"" she said -- a senior aide to the senator said the prospect of missing the November debate was ""in the back of her mind some.""

""She's been saying the same thing, but we set it up more aggressively, more forcefully today, because I think it's more important than ever for people to understand,"" the aide said.

For his part, Castro went away from the more pointed strategy he had employed in September's debate -- one that earned some negative reviews -- and delivered a more subdued approach.

Castro, in the most-buzzed-about moment of his night, accused Trump of ""caging kids on the border"" and ""effectively letting ISIS prisoners run free"" in Syria. But his lack of aggression toward his fellow Democrats stood out, especially after the Texas Democrat had repeatedly gone after Joe Biden in the Houston debate over the former vice president's memory.

Castro insisted there had been no change in strategy on Tuesday.

""What I felt is that I needed to go out there and to continue to articulate a strong, compelling vision for the future of our country,"" he said. ""And I think that I did that.""

But the reviews from unaffiliated Democrats were not glowing.

""Castro totally faded,"" said Mo Elleithee, a longtime Democratic operative. ""When you are on the bubble, you cannot afford to fade into the background. You have to find the opportunities.""

Like Castro, O'Rourke denied that the prospect of making the fifth debate was on his mind as he took the stage on Tuesday.

""I really wasn't"" thinking about it, he said. ""I'm really focused on making sure that I see things as clearly as possible, speaking about them as honestly as possible.""

And O'Rourke's strategy backs that up: The former congressman delivered an even debate performance that at times mimicked the directness he has brought to past contests.

O'Rourke accused Warren of being ""punitive"" on certain issues regarding wealth and entered into a heated exchange with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg over guns.

The moments echoed some that O'Rourke had at earlier debates, suggesting that the Texas Democrat who entered the presidential race with sky-high hopes believes what he has been doing will be enough to land him on the debate stage again.

The wild card of the night in this group of bubble Democrats was Gabbard, who was back on the stage after failing to qualify for September's debate.

Gabbard, a Hawaii congresswoman and Iraq War veteran, was aggressive on Tuesday, regularly closing her questions by asking other candidates directly to join her in certain policy proposals that she knows are out of step with others in the field.

The most contentious moment came when she argued that the violence in Syria at the hands of Turkey was, in part, to blame on Washington politicians who ""who have supported this ongoing regime-change war in Syria that started in 2011."" Gabbard said at one point that ""politicians in our country from both parties"" have ""the blood of the Kurds"" on their hands.

Buttigieg, the only other veteran onstage, aggressively attacked her answer, calling her ""dead wrong.""

For Gabbard, though, the moment could be viewed as a win for her devout following, who, for the most part, are anti-interventionist.

Still, Gabbard appears to be preparing for a world in which she is not on the debate stage. Days ahead of October's debate, she had threatened to boycott the contest in protest of the DNC rules, seemingly setting up grounds for her to complain if she doesn't make the November contest.

Gabbard's campaign did not return a request for comment."

Kamala Harris on Wednesday defended her calls for Twitter to suspend President Donald Trump's account, a plan she reiterated on stage at the fourth Democratic primary presidential debate hosted by CNN and The New York Times.",2019-10-16,CNN,Kamala Harris defends her push to get Trump's Twitter account suspended,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/16/politics/kamala-harris-trump-twitter-suspension-cnntv/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Sen. Kamala Harris on Wednesday defended her calls for Twitter to suspend President Donald Trump's account, a plan she reiterated on stage at the fourth Democratic primary presidential debate hosted by CNN and The New York Times.

Harris first made her call following the President's tweets about the whistleblower complaint at the center of the Ukraine scandal. During Tuesday night's debate, Harris called out Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, one of the field's front-runners, for not following her lead in saying Trump's Twitter account should be taken down. Warren brushed off Harris' proposal, saying she didn't just want to ""push Trump off Twitter"" but also out of the White House.

The contentious moment led to some criticism for Harris, including from former US National Security Council spokesperson Tommy Vietor, who called Harris' push during the debate ""small ball.""

Harris, however, told CNN's John Berman on ""New Day"" Wednesday that Trump's ""threatening remarks"" about the whistleblower and others is a ""serious matter.""

""It's a serious matter. And it is a matter of the safety of those individuals,"" she said. ""You can look at the fact that the shooter in El Paso was influenced by the words that the President of the United States, unfiltered, uses through this medium on Twitter. He has 65 million followers. And we have to take seriously the implications that are about the threatening witnesses, intimidating witnesses and obstructing justice.""

She added: ""When witnesses are threatened by the President of the United States, it is a very serious matter. And people will be influenced by those threats. And we have to say that it is not OK and that he has revoked his privilege to use this platform because it is a privilege that can be and should be taken away.""

Harris also said companies like Facebook and Twitter need to adopt the same set of standards to govern what is allowed on their platforms.

""And the point also has to be, you can't have one set of standards for Facebook and another for Twitter,"" she said on Wednesday. ""All of these social media companies and these online platforms, which are so powerful in their ability to impact perception about an issue and to influence behaviors. Let's be clear about that. There have to be standards, and the standards have to be the same. You can't have one standard for Facebook and another for Twitter.""

While companies like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter collaborate closely and are closely aligned on policing content from terrorist groups, each is a separate company and has their own set of standards for political speech.

In May, for instance, when a fake video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi circulated, the three major platforms acted differently. YouTube removed the video, Facebook let the video stay online but downranked it meaning it would be seen by less people and Twitter allowed the video to stay online.

Earlier this month, Harris sent a letter to the Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey listing six tweets by the President that she says violated Twitter's rules. The White House called Harris' demand ""authoritarian"" and defended Trump's use of Twitter.

""It is not surprising that Kamala Harris, someone who believes in bigger government and more regulation, would like to silence her political opponents,"" the White House said in a statement. ""In fact, it's rather authoritarian of her. President Trump's use of technology to communicate directly with the American people and share his Administration's unprecedented accomplishments should be praised, not criticized.""

On Tuesday, Twitter issued a clarification in a blog post on rules for tweets by world leaders, saying ""that the accounts of world leaders are not above our policies entirely."" The social media network reiterated its announcement from June that some tweets from world leaders that break its rules would not be removed from the platform if the company decided they were in the ""public interest."" Twitter said it would instead put a disclaimer on the tweets explaining that although they broke the company's rules they would not be removed.

Twitter has not labeled any of Trump's tweets in this way."

""I wouldn't worry about it, fellas, I wouldn't worry about it,"" Trump joked alongside Stanley Cup champions the St. Louis Blues.

Inside the West Wing, sources say, there is escalating concern about administration witnesses who are giving depositions on Capitol Hill.

The frustration comes as the Office of the Vice President said it will not comply with House requests for documents related to the impeachment inquiry, according to a Tuesday letter from Matthew Morgan, counsel for Vice President Mike Pence.

The letter cited White House counsel's previous letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi questioning the legitimacy of the impeachment inquiry, saying the process ""calls into question your commitment to fundamental fairness and due process rights.""

He won 80 of 88 counties here, including nine that voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. His narrowest victory among those nine came in here in Montgomery County outside of Dayton, where he eked out a win with less than a percentage point.

But on the eve of Tuesday's CNN/New York Times debate at Otterbein University, interviews with voters in this swing county suggest signs of electoral trouble for the commander in chief. Though Trump's approval rating has been relatively steady nationally, in nearly two-dozen interviews, voters here -- particularly independents -- expressed growing unease about Trump's actions, from his attempt to enlist help from Ukraine's president to investigate his political rival to his abrupt decision to abandon a key US ally in Syria , stunning leaders of his own party.

Melissa Curran, a 43-year-old independent from here in Huber Heights, was incredulous about the President's request for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.

""Why is he going outside the US to do that? If he's got accusations, we have a criminal system here that he should have trusted,"" she said. ""But he's fired so many people here who didn't do what he wanted that I feel like we don't have a voice anymore.""

At the same time, voters feeling that agitation about Trump said they weren't sure yet whether Democratic calls for impeachment are warranted. They were often quick to say they want to see more facts about whether the President did, in fact, pressure Ukraine to investigate 2020 rival Joe Biden and Biden's son Hunter. (There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.)

Notably, the sense of uncertainty for Trump in Ohio isn't grounded in excitement about his Democratic rivals, but rather from eroding confidence in the president's decision-making, and palpable disgust felt by female suburban voters like Curran, who has begun to believe that Trump is seeking absolute power.

Curran didn't vote for Trump or Hillary Clinton in 2016 because she wasn't motivated by either of them. But she now wants him out of the White House, even though she believes he's done some ""positive things"" on the economy.

""If he would calm himself and humble himself, he could have been a great president, but the way he handles his business breaks my heart,"" Curran told CNN.

She pointed to Trump's shutdown over the federal government over border wall funding last December as an example of what she sees as his thirst for total control.

""Shutting down the government because he wanted to stomp his feet over this wall, I mean this is an Air Force town -- so many people were affected by his tantrum,"" said Curran, comparing his behavior to that of an ""errant child.""

Curran plans to vote against Trump at the ballot box in 2020, but she is looking to the Democrats to lay out more facts on exactly what Trump's intentions were with Ukraine: ""Words are words. Impeaching somebody for their thoughts? Everybody in this world would be out if we just did it for our thoughts. I want to see the facts.""

""But would I re-elect him? Absolutely not,"" she added. ""No matter what, I will not put him back in office. I feel like he's going to destroy this country bit by bit.""

Burden of proof

Recent national polling has shown something close to an even split among Americans on whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office. In a CNN poll in late September poll, after the House announced a formal inquiry, 47% of Americans supported those moves, up from 41% in May. The change over that time period was driven largely by independents and Republicans. Support for impeachment and removal among independents, who will be key to Trump's chances of re-election, rose by 11 points. Among Republicans, it increased by 8 points.

It is not yet clear whether the release of the White House transcript of his call with Ukraine President Volodomyr Zelensky will be the tipping point in his presidency -- or simply one more strike against him in a series of decisions that swing voters find troubling. But clearly the President himself has been dismayed by the poll numbers, lashing out on Twitter at Fox News after its new poll last week showed 51% of registered voters want him impeached and removed; and 51% also said his administration is more corrupt than previous administrations.

Interviews with voters here in Ohio largely reflected the uncertainty about impeachment nationally. While the Ukraine controversy pushed some over the edge toward impeachment, interviews here suggest that Democrats have not convincingly made the case to other voters that Trump's Ukraine call is significantly different than the murky findings of the Russia investigation by former special counsel Robert Mueller.

The uproar around the Russia investigation went on for so long that Republican-leaning-independent Tim Sartori said he just started to tune it all out.

""From the jump, it seems like people have been on him -- it's like they're on a witch hunt,"" said Sartori, a 55-year-old salesman, recalling the phrase that Trump repeatedly used to describe the Russia probe. ""He's cocky and he's arrogant, but I'm not sure if this is more of the same,"" he said of the Ukraine matter. He noted that, in his view, the Russia investigation yielded scant evidence of wrongdoing by Trump.

Sartori said he's withholding judgment for now on impeachment.

""If the facts come out that he did something he shouldn't have done, then yeah, my attitude would change on him, but right now it seems like they're reaching,"" he said. ""To be honest, I heard about (the Ukraine call), but I don't know exactly what he said.""

""I want to wait for the facts,"" Sartori said. ""If they actually get something, if it's something that he did that he should be impeached for, then he should be impeached.""

That doesn't mean, however, that Sartori is keen on pulling the lever for one of the Democrats to be the next president: ""There's nobody I've seen who lights me on fire.""

Republican Wayne Furay, a 58-year-old bailiff from nearby Xenia (in neighboring Greene County, which Trump won) said he too is trying to sort through the Ukraine controversy and undecided about which way he'll go in 2020.

He's struggling with his reservations about Trump's judgment and his dislike for Democrats' negativity toward the president, along with the Democratic Party's shift to the left.

Trump's request to Ukraine for help investigating the Bidens ""was probably a bad move,"" Furay said. ""But I don't think it's cause for that,"" he said of impeachment. ""Everything from the start has been noise.""

""I don't like his demeanor. He says what he thinks, but he's not very couth,"" Furay said of Trump. ""But it seems like kind of a witch hunt. They look for everything he does wrong, and it's been like that from the beginning.... I don't really like him that much, but I don't really like any of the other ones, either.""

Lester Settlage, an 83-year-old retired farmer who voted for Trump, also expressed confusion about the interactions between Trump and Ukraine. Asked whether Trump deserves reelection, he gave the President high marks on the economy.

""I mean if you measure it by the stock market, the economy is booming. Look around,"" Settlage said, gesturing to a packed parking lot outside Target in Montgomery County. ""Look at all the cars here that are less than 3 years old.""

Thus far in the Ukraine investigation, Settlage doesn't trust the motives of Democrats.

""I don't know how to feel about it,"" he said of Trump's call with Ukraine, ""because I'm not exactly sure what Ukraine knows. But Ukraine is an independent country. It's no longer with Russia,"" he said. ""So what's all the hullabaloo about? ... Let's get some policy work done.""

For voters who have paid closer attention to the President's actions -- and his words on the call -- like Frederic Scheffler, an 83-year-old Republican from Centerville, Ohio, the Ukraine matter is yet another troubling development in string of erratic decisions that have raised questions about whether Trump has sound judgment.

Three years after voting for Trump, he's considering voting for a Democrat in 2020—a surprise even to him.

Scheffler said Trump's unpredictable and sometimes inexplicable actions have unnerved him, from Ukraine to Trump's decision to pull back US troops in Syria , leaving longtime allies open to attack.

""He seems to be doing things independently without Congress. It's disturbing,"" said Scheffler.

Like other voters, he wants to see more facts about the President's intentions in his dealings with Ukraine.

""If they can prove that he put pressure on Ukraine that would be one thing,"" Scheffler said. But he doesn't think impeachment would be good for the country -- and notes that the President of Ukraine said there was no quid pro quo in his discussions with Trump.

For now, he'd rather register his disapproval at the polls next year. Unless the nominee is Elizabeth Warren, whose ideas he describes as expensive and ""way out left.""

""It would have to be a moderate, not someone who's way out there,"" he said. ""But who's moderate?"""

(CNN) President Donald Trump has a nose for weakness. And Joe Biden's softest spot is his near-mystical reverence for family.

Nothing is likely to cause Biden more pain, to test his cool and to force him into an error more than an attack on his kin. The former vice president can barely get through a sentence without a poignant reference to his late parents, his second wife, Jill, his children or his grandchildren. In a life scarred by tragedy, he has already buried two of his kids and a first wife. Grief over the death of his eldest son, Beau, from brain cancer nixed a run for president in 2016.

So Trump has plunged his 2020 election dagger into Biden's second son, targeting Hunter Biden with unsubstantiated allegations about his business dealings in Ukraine and China. Going after family is one of his preferred tricks: In the 2016 presidential race, Trump mocked the Bush dynasty, knowing it would unhinge its scion Jeb. He upset Ted Cruz by insulting his wife, and raised Bill Clinton's affairs while debating Hillary Clinton (though eliciting only a slow blink).

Yet, with little sense of irony, Trump resents attacks on his own clan (and has shown flagrant disregard for potential conflicts of interest in his own sons' business ventures. As is often the case with leaders with an authoritarian streak, his kids -- kept close in the White House and in Trump's businesses -- are the only ones who can offer the loyalty he craves.

Trump signaled to then-special counsel Robert Mueller that probing his family accounts would cross a red line. But there are no such lines when the President himself perceives an enemy.

Postcard from Kiev

Demonstrators light smoke flares as they march in central Kiev.

About 20,000 people marched in a nationalist rally in Kiev, with many calling on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky not to move forward on a peace deal with Russia-backed separatists in the country's east.

""The protesters marched in groups. We saw regular soldiers, veterans and nationalist groups. Some had their faces covered and wore all black. Most striking was the diversity of ages -- we saw teenagers right up to pensioners,"" writes CNN's Sebastian Shukla to Meanwhile from Kiev.

""Flares were lit and chants such as 'Death to the enemy' and 'Glory to Ukraine' were shouted by the entire contingent. Protesters marched down to Maidan Square and the Presidential Administration, where they covered the building in stickers saying 'No to capitulation' -- a clear reference to Zelensky's recent move to form a peace deal in the east.""

'A strategic calamity'

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took the rare step of openly breaking with Trump over a key policy issue. ""I am gravely concerned by recent events in Syria and by our nation's apparent response thus far,"" the Kentucky Republican said. ""I look forward to discussing what the United States can do to avoid a strategic calamity with my Senate colleagues and with senior administration officials.""

Syria, in brief

Kurds in northern Syria are gambling with their autonomy by turning to Russia and the Syrian government for protection after Trump withdrew US troops. Now the White House is trying to cover its blushes after the President's strategy was panned as a foreign policy disaster at home and abroad. Here's the latest, in brief:

The Syrian Kurdish governing coalition said it would sign a ""memorandum of understanding"" with Moscow, in an attempt to ""prevent the Turkish attack.""

Syrian President Bashar Assad's army entered several cities in the area, according to state media -- part of a deal with the Kurds to enforce the border with Turkey.

Turkey accused the Kurds of deliberately releasing ISIS prisoners. Trump soon echoed that claim -- but a senior US official told CNN that's just not true.

Trump announced new sanctions on Turkey over an incursion for which he cleared the way last week, warning that its ""action is precipitating a humanitarian crisis and setting conditions for possible war crimes.""

Vice President Mike Pence said he would travel to Turkey to push for a ceasefire between groups in the area.

In a press briefing about US sanctions on Turkey, Vice President Mike Pence told reporters that Trump had spoken to both Kurdish General Mazloum Kobani Abdi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and CNN got a look at his notes in the process.

Democrats debate

The CNN/New York Times presidential debate tonight in Ohio will be the most pivotal moment yet in the Democratic race. The clash among 12 candidates will highlight growing vulnerabilities among front-runners and offer outsiders one of a dwindling number of chances to break through. Here's what each major candidate must do:

Joe Biden must make sure his debate is not overshadowed by Trump's unsubstantiated claims about his son's financial dealings. He has fiercely rebutted any suggestion of impropriety, and his Democratic rivals have defended him so far. But they may not be above wondering why Hunter Biden risked conflicts of interest by doing business abroad while his father was vice president.

Bernie Sanders is desperate for a strong showing after a heart attack raised questions about his age and health. The 78-year-old senator from Vermont was already in danger of losing the battle for the party's progressive left. He can't afford to slip.

Elizabeth Warren has overtaken Sanders and is now considered a co-front-runner with Biden. That means she's got a target on her back. The liberal senator from Massachusetts bills herself as the candidate with a plan for anything, but expect her rivals to attack her glaringly unspecific position on a top issue: health care.

Pete Buttigieg's quietly impressive campaign and bumper fundraising could set him up for a possible late surge into the first contest in Iowa. But he must disprove impressions that -- as the 37-year-old mayor of a small Indiana city -- he lacks the experience to be president.

Kamala Harris needs something to happen. Soon. A campaign that started with great promise has sputtered, partly due to the California senator's shaky grasp of her own policies. Time is running out for a leap into the top tier.

Everyone else -- including Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Obama administration Cabinet Secretary Julián Castro and former Congressman Beto O'Rourke of Texas -- simply must give voters a reason to care. Some of them are already in danger of falling short of the stricter criteria for the next debate, in November.

Her gun control, made public in August on Medium, shows Warren believes the current ten percent excise tax on firearms is too low. She wants to raise that tax to 30 percent while increasing the tax on ammunition to 50 percent.

Because excise taxes are paid directly by the consumer–the taxes are added to the price of the goods–this means a $500 gun would immediately cost $650 and the price for a $20 box of ammo would immediately rise to $30.

Warren claims this taxation policy would “bring in new federal revenue” that can used for “gun violence prevention.” And she simultaneously suggests the tax would raise the price on guns and ammo to a level sufficient to stifle sales.

She does not explain how reducing sales via tax policy can bring in new revenue. Rather, she cites”federal excise tax on cigarettes, domestic wine, or even airline tickets,” to try to bolster justify pushing for more taxes on firearms and bullets.

Ironically, Warren also wants government-imposed limits on the number of guns Americans can purchase. This would cut sales as well, further reducing tax revenue.

Klobuchar defended her attacks, saying that she wanted to be president of all of America, not just half of America.

“If people are tired of the noise and nonsense and the extremes, they’ve got a home with me,” she said afterward to CNN.

Klobuchar said that Warren’s Medicare-for-all was a “pipe dream” and she did “not even come close” to answering the question about how she planned to pay for her plan.

“As I’ve said, Bernie [Sanders] has answered that question, he’s made that very clear, and I think that’s one of the things she needs to do,” she said afterward.

“Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry,” Warren said.

Warren continued:

She said she read the entire Mueller report and added, “When I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown, too, a fare-thee-well, that this president had obstructed justice and had done it repeatedly.”

Impeachment is the way we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences.

However, Mueller made no such determination on obstruction of justice. He made that point clear during his testimony before lawmakers in July.

As Breitbart News reported:

His correction came during his testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, in reference to comments he made at an earlier hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee to Lieu. Lieu asked him, “I’d like to ask you, the reason again, that you did not indict Donald Trump is because of OLC opinion stating that you cannot indict a sitting president, correct?” Mueller responded, “That is correct.” After Mueller’s response, Democrats latched on to his comment as evidence that Trump was guilty of obstruction of justice and that Mueller would have charged him if it were not a Justice Department legal office opinion.

Mueller corrected the record after the fact, reiterating that he did not make a determination on obstruction of justice:

Mueller stated:

I want to add one correction to my testimony this morning. I wanted to go back to one thing that was said this morning by Mr. [Ted Lieu (D-CA] — who said, and I quote, ‘You didn’t charge the president because of the [Office of Legal Counsel (OLC)] opinion.’ That is not the correct way to say it.

“As we say in the report and as I said in the opening, we did not reach a determination as to whether the president committed a crime,” he added.

Attorney General William Barr determined that Trump did not obstruct justice, explaining that “the evidence developed by the Special Counsel is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense.”"

That unique prospect could scramble the electoral calculations next year for both parties.

As impeachment proceeds, the division in the country ""is going to go into the stratosphere,"" predicts Charles Coughlin, a veteran Republican political strategist based in Phoenix. ""Which I think creates an opportunity for a candidate ... to fill that narrative: We have to start talking about what brings us together and not what pushes us apart. I think there will be giant pieces of room in the electorate, both Republican and Democratic, to articulate that notion.""

Uncharted territory

One thing that's clear already is that if the House votes to impeach Trump -- and the Senate does not reach the two-thirds majority required to remove him from office -- the nation will face a novel political situation in 2020. None of the previous three presidents who faced a serious impeachment threat appeared on the next general election ballot.

Richard Nixon retreated into exile in San Clemente and never again sought public office after he resigned in August 1974. His resignation came after the House Judiciary Committee approved articles of impeachment against him over Watergate with bipartisan support, and leading Senate Republicans told him his support in that chamber was crumbling.

Bill Clinton finished his second term as President but was barred by the Constitution's two-term limit from running again in 2000. The Republican-controlled House voted to impeach him in 1998 but the Senate fell well short of the votes needed to remove him over the perjury charges that emerged from his affair with a White House intern.

Only Andrew Johnson, among the presidents facing impeachment, sought to run again after his ordeal, though he failed to secure the nomination. Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president, picked Johnson, a pro-Union Democrat from the border state of Tennessee, as his vice president in 1864 to create a national ""unity"" ticket. But after Lincoln was assassinated in 1865 and Johnson ascended to the presidency, he reverted to his roots in a Democratic Party that, at the time, was much more sympathetic to the South and hostile to the rights of freed slaves. Johnson repeatedly tried to stymie the agenda of the Republican House and Senate majorities to ensure rights for the freed slaves and eliminate Confederate influence in the Southern states rejoining the Union.

After an escalating series of confrontations and vetoes, the House in March 1868 impeached Johnson on a party-line vote; all Republicans who voted backed impeachment and all voting Democrats opposed it. The Senate then fell one vote short of removing Johnson from office in May, just months before the 1868 election. All Senate Democrats and seven Republicans voted to acquit him on the impeachment charges, which centered on his defiance of a law the Republican majorities passed to prevent him from dismissing executive branch officials without congressional approval.

Johnson's strategic move

David O. Stewart, author of the 2009 book ""Impeached: The Trial of President Andrew Johnson and the Fight for Lincoln's Legacy,"" said the nearness of the next election was one reason that just enough senators acquitted Johnson.

""I actually think the impending election probably helped him resist the impeachment case because there were a bunch of people who said, 'He is going to be gone pretty soon so why are we killing ourselves?' "" Stewart said in an interview. ""And there was a fear of a backlash that they would make him sympathetic by pursuing him.""

Having survived the threat of removal by his adopted party in Congress, Johnson then came full circle in his partisan migration: He sought to win the Democratic nomination in 1868 to face the formidable Republican choice, Ulysses S. Grant, the general of the North's victorious armies during the war.

""Johnson desperately wanted to be nominated, and it was for vindication and he thought he could win,"" said Stewart. ""He thought Grant was vulnerable.""

Johnson sent intermediaries to make his case at the Democratic convention in New York. On the first ballot, he finished second, but it was quickly clear those votes were more a gesture of respect than a reflection of any genuine desire to choose him. Johnson quickly faded from contention and Democrats on their 22nd ballot chose as their nominee New York Gov. Horatio Seymour, who was promptly beaten by Grant.

Because there are so few precedents for how an impeachment may affect the next election -- and no precedent for the impeached president appearing on the ballot again -- experts are cautious about offering too many predictions of how today's confrontation could affect 2020.

""Anybody who says they know what is going to happen is wrong,"" says Tom Rath, a longtime Republican operative in New Hampshire. ""There is no easy parallel to find.""

A few common threads

But some common threads do run through these previous struggles, even if no one can say for sure how relevant they will prove in 2020.

One is that in each previous case, the party that drove the impeachment won the White House in the next election: Republicans triumphed in 1868 and 2000, and Democrats won in 1976. Despite predictions of a backlash, in each case the country turned away from the president's party in the succeeding election.

Another is that in each case, the winning candidate promised to restore national unity after the bitter partisan conflict.

Grant, as the leader of the victorious army during the Civil War, was a living symbol of Union. And though he was clearly identified as a champion of the North, Grant, to the extent candidates made their views known in those years, also signaled his determination to pursue reconciliation with the South. In his inaugural address, he declared that all issues relating to Reconstruction must ""be approached calmly, without prejudice, hate or sectional pride."" (Brutal violence by Southerners opposed to rights for the freed slaves forced Grant to intervene in the former Confederate states more aggressively than those words implied.)

After the ""long national nightmare"" of Watergate and Nixon's resignation, Jimmy Carter in 1976 also won election after presenting himself as a unifying figure who would restore to America ""a government as good as its people."" As an evangelical Christian who quoted Bob Dylan in his acceptance speech at the 1976 Democratic Convention, a Southerner who supported civil rights and a centrist governor who blended liberal and conservative themes, Carter embodied the promise of cultural, racial and political reconciliation after not only the bruising Nixon years but also the larger tumults of the 1960s.

""Our country's lived through a time of torment,"" Carter declared in that acceptance speech. ""It's now a time for healing. We want to have faith again. We want to be proud again. We just want the truth again.""

Trump likely to take a different tack

In 2000, after Clinton's impeachment, Republican George W. Bush won by presenting himself as a ""uniter, not a divider"" who had worked closely with Democrats in the Texas state Legislature. Bush criticized Clinton's behavior but only indirectly, through his pledge to ""restore honor and dignity to the Oval Office,"" a cornerstone of his campaign.

And Bush distanced himself at times from congressional Republicans, pledged to seek common cause with the centrist ""new Democrat"" movement that Clinton led and lamented what he called ""a cycle of bitterness, an arms race of anger.""

Though partisan conflict grew over his two terms, especially after the Iraq War, Bush initially ran in 2000 on a message of inclusion: ""I will bring Americans together,"" he said.

No one expects Trump to follow those tracks, if he remains in office after the impeachment inquiry and is able to seek reelection, as now seems most likely.

If anything, the impeachment struggle may push Trump further toward a strategy of energizing his core supporters and turning out more of them who did not vote in 2016. The reason is that the process could complicate his hopes of capturing voters ambivalent or conflicted about his presidency.

Bad impressions solidifying

So far there's not clear evidence in polling that the allegations against Trump related to Ukraine, or his belligerent response to them, are increasing the number of voters who disapprove of his performance in office or reducing the number who approve

But recent polling suggests that the new controversy is hardening the most negative impressions of Trump among the majority of voters who have consistently disapproved of him during his presidency.

""For people who have this uneasiness about him, I think this is just a really different event"" from the Russia investigation, says Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg. Unlike that controversy, she says, ""What happened in Ukraine is not about the past; it's about the future. ... And it's just letting the things about him that people don't like come to the fore in this dramatic way.""

In an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll released last week , for instance, fully 93% of voters who said they disapprove of Trump's overall performance in office said it was not acceptable ""for a president to ask a foreign country´s leader to help investigate a potential political opponent,"" according to detailed figures provided to me by Marist. Among those disapproving voters, 92% also said Trump was mostly serving his campaign's interests, not the country's, in his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Similarly, a recent Quinnipiac University national poll found that among voters who disapprove of Trump's job performance, 94% said he has abused the power of his office and 93% said he considers himself above the law, according to figures provided by the pollsters.

These sentiments pose a clear challenge to a cornerstone of the Republican strategy for 2020. Republicans believe Trump can survive majority disapproval of his performance by disqualifying the eventual Democratic nominee to the point that some voters who disapprove of Trump vote for him anyway. No one in either party rules out Trump's capacity to damage his opponent. But to the extent the impeachment fight reinforces negative views about Trump -- such as the belief that he considers himself above the law or puts his personal interests above the nation's -- winning voters who disapprove of his performance will only grow more difficult for him, whatever their views about the Democratic alternative.

""It is getting harder and harder for him to convince people who don't support his performance (in office) that they should support him for reelection,"" says Josh Schwerin, a senior strategist for Priorities USA, a leading Democratic super PAC. ""There is no good scenario here for Trump, absent some exonerating fact that doesn't seem possible. Given the facts and the numbers we are seeing, it is hard to believe he doesn't get impeached by the House and no matter what happens in the Senate it is going to be a drag on him.""

Democratic primary could also be affected

Indeed, in last week's Marist Poll, fully 95% of voters who disapproved of Trump's job performance also said they now intend to vote against him for reelection. Eight-five percent of those who disapproved in the survey endorsed the extraordinary step of the Senate removing him from office.

One of the biggest unanswered questions impeachment raises is whether the confrontation will change the kind of alternative that most voters skeptical of Trump will find appealing in 2020.

The dominant assumption among the Democratic presidential contenders gathering for a CNN debate tonight in Ohio is that after four years of searing partisan combat with Trump and congressional Republicans, the party wants a ""fighter""; even former Vice President Joe Biden, who has offered a more centrist message than his principal rivals, is promising to ""beat (Trump) like a drum.""

The Carter and Bush precedents, though, suggest there may be more of an audience than Democrats now expect for a conciliatory candidate in 2020. An impeachment fight that further fans the flames of partisan conflict could make voters less enthusiastic about replacing a conservative President who revels in political combat with a liberal, such as Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont or Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who promises unending confrontation over a different set of issues.

One final twist from the Johnson impeachment may unsettle both parties. As soon as Johnson left the White House, as Stewart recounts, he began maneuvering to return to Congress to continue his campaign against the postwar reconstruction of the South. In 1869, a time when US senators were picked by state legislatures, Johnson campaigned for an appointment in Tennessee, but fell just short. In 1872, he ran unsuccessfully for the US House. Finally, in 1875 he achieved a measure of vindication when the Tennessee state Legislature finally appointed him to a Senate seat. The satisfaction was fleeting: About four months after Johnson returned to Washington, his resentments still burning, he died from a stroke.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) would not deny Tuesday that her plan for “Medicare for All” raised taxes on the middle class — even as she did everything she could to avoid confirming it.

A CNN panel in the spin room after the fourth Democrat debate on Tuesday night in Columbus, Ohio, struggled to pin Warren down on the question of whether her policy would raise middle class taxes.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), the author of the bill Warren backs, has admitted openly that middle class Americans would pay higher taxes under his (and her) plan, but argues that middle class families would save money overall because their health insurance costs would supposedly fall.

But Warren has dodged the question in debate after debate, and interview after interview — and did so again when confronted by her opponents in the debate.

In the spin room after the debate, CNN’s anchors and political pundits struggled to extract an answer from Warren. Jake Tapper tried to help her craft an answer that would admit the tax hike, but argue for lower overall costs; John King pointed out, sympathetically, that Warren ran the risk of being accused of lying to the public.

Warren replied, over and over again: “My commitment is I will not sign a bill into law that raises costs on middle class families.”

David Axelrod, former White House adviser to President Barack Obama during the Obamacare fight, was incredulous at Warren’s claim that she knew with certainty that “Medicare for All” would not result in higher overall costs for any middle class family. “How can you even make an assurance as to how all this is going to pencil out?”

Warren stuck to her talking point, refusing to admit she would raise taxes — but declining to deny she would, either.

“I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people, and all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said ‘don’t even try because you will never get it passed,’” Warren recalled of her plans for the CFPB, a government agency responsible for consumer protection in the financial sector that was formed in 2011. “We need to get out there and fight for the things that touch people’s lives,” the senator added.

Biden then blurted out: “I agreed with the great job she did!”

The former vice president then raised his voice as he explained how he secured votes in Congress to establish the agency.

“I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So, let’s get those things straight too,” Biden said.

“I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law,” Warren replied softly, prompting laughter from both Biden and debate attendees.

“I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law, but understand—,” she continued.

Biden then interrupted Warren with a compliment, stating: “You did a hell of a job in your job.”

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who has decried the ultra-wealthy’s influence in politics in the past, has received contributions from at least 30 billionaires over the course of her political career, the New York Post found.

Warren prides her presidential bid as a 100 percent grassroots-funded campaign. While she has raised millions — an impressive $24.6 million in the third quarter — she reportedly used $10.4 million in leftover funds from her 2018 senatorial bid to cushion her current campaign. During the course of her senatorial campaign, Warren happily attended fundraisers and accepted money from big donors, sparking questions surrounding her newfound commitment to keep big donors out of politics.

The New York Post analyzed Warren’s past campaign contributions and found that she has accepted donations from at least 30 billionaires throughout her political tenure.

The Post reports:

Christopher Sacca, a venture capitalist who appeared on “Shark Tank”, gave $2,800 to Warren in May. The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate also netted two $2,500 contributions from GitHub founder Tom Preston-Werner’s wife, Theresa, in June. That same month Susan Pritzker, wife of Hyatt heir Nicholas Pritzker II, donated $2,500 to Warren. The donations run from 2011 to 2019 and include contributions to Warren’s presidential and Senate campaigns. Most of the individual billionaires are giving at or near the maximum contribution limit, which currently is $2,800 for the primary and $2,800 for the general election for a total for $5,600.

This revelation comes in the wake of Warren’s public criticisms of the wealthy. Over the summer, the presidential hopeful bragged that billionaires “aren’t in favor” of the idea of her presidency:

While Warren has not gone as far as her ideological counterpart, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), in calling for the disappearance of billionaires, the “Ultra-Millionaire Tax” has become a hallmark of her campaign. The proposal would implement a two percent wealth tax on those with more than $50 million in assets. A three percent tax would be imposed on individuals with more than $1 billion in assets:

Warren came under fire last week after refusing to say if her potential running mate would refrain from attending high-dollar fundraisers.

“Is your vice presidential pick going to also try and avoid those high-dollar fundraisers as well?” a reporter asked.

Instead of offering an emphatic “yes,” Warren dodged the question, calling it “a little premature.”

“You know, I think it’s a little premature to be talking about vice presidential. We’re still in primary here, and I’m working hard on this,” she said.

I worked late’– oh yeah, unlike anybody else,” the presidential hopeful sarcastically stated during a campaign stop in Hampton Falls, New Hampshire, on Labor Day. “But ‘I worked late or inherited wealth, and so this is mine.’”

“And the answer is yeah, you did. Good for you. You did have a great idea and you did work hard. No one is angry about that, but here’s the deal. You built a great fortune here in America. I guarantee you built it at least in part using workers all of us help pay to educate,” she continued.

“Yeah. You built it at least in part, getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped pay to build. Yep. You built it at least in part, protected by police and firefighters all of us help pay their salaries,” she added.

Warren’s relationship with the ultra-wealthy has been convoluted over the years. Although she has targeted millionaires and billionaires over the course of her presidential campaign, she has received money from at least 30 billionaires over the course of her political career."

“As usual Senator Warren is 100% wrong in diagnosing the problem, there absolutely [are] excesses in technology and in some cases having them divest parts of their business is the right move,” conceded Yang.

“But we also have to be realistic that competition doesn’t solve all the problems.”

“It’s not like any of us want to use the fourth-best navigation app… There’s a reason why nobody is using Bing today. Sorry Microsoft, it’s true!”

“It’s not like breaking up these tech companies will revive mainstream businesses around the country.”

“And as the parent of two young children, I’m particularly concerned about screen use and its effect on our children. Studies clearly show that we’re seeing record levels of anxiety and depression coincident with smartphone adoption and social media use.”

“Breaking up the tech companies does nothing to make our kids healthier. What we have to do is we have to hone in on the specific problems we’re trying to solve and use 21st-century solutions for 21st-century problems. Using a 20th-century antitrust framework will not work. We need new solutions and a new toolkit.”

Elizabeth Warren responded to Yang’s remarks, stating “I’m not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy. It’s time to fight back.”

She went on to slam Amazon for its domination of America’s retail market, and the way it crowds out competition from small businesses.

“Think about it this way — when you talk about it this way when you talk about how it works, and competition. About eight percent [to] nine percent of retail sales in bricks and sticks stores happen at Walmart. About 49 percent of all sales online happen in one place — that’s Amazon. It collects information from every little business. And then Amazon does something else — it runs the platform, gets all the information, and then goes into competition with those little businesses.”

“You get to be the umpire in the baseball or you get to be a team, but you don’t get to do both at the same time. We need to enforce our antitrust laws, break up these giant companies that are dominating big tech, big pharma, big oil — all of them.”

Whereas Tulsi Gabbard has been consistent on the question of censorship, criticizing big tech companies for “throwing free speech out the window,” Warren has flip-flopped on the issue. She condemned Facebook for its power to “shut down debate” after it removed an ad for her campaign in March this year, but a few months later called for tech companies to censor criticism of Kamala Harris.

Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) “viral” answer on faith and traditional marriage at last week’s Human Rights Campaign (HRC) LGBT town hall was a maximum donor of the Massachusetts lawmaker.

Warren made waves last week after Morgan Cox III, the chair of the HRC board of directors, asked Warren how she would respond to a supporter if he or she approached her and said, “Senator, I’m old-fashioned and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.'”

“Well, I’m going to assume it’s a guy who said that,” Warren said. “And I’m going to say, ‘Then just marry one woman.’ I’m cool with that.”

“Assuming you can find one,” she added, prompting laughs.

Warren’s answer went viral, with her campaign touting over 12 million views in 15 hours (across multiple media platforms):

CNN described Cox as the chair to the HRC board of directors and noted his involvement with “a real estate investment firm in Dallas, Texas.” However, CNN failed to mention Cox’s status as a Warren donor.

Donor data matching Cox’s profile indicates that he donated $2,700 to Warren in July 2017 and $2,700 in April 2018.

The Washington Free Beacon reports:

FEC filings show that a “Morgan Cox III” from Plano, Tex., who listed his occupation as “investor” donated the legal maximum of $2,700 to Warren’s Senate primary campaign in 2017, followed by two donations totaling $2,700 to her general election campaign the following year. Cox also donated $2,700 to the Elizabeth Warren Action Fund PAC. Records show that a “Morgan W. Cox III” who donated to the Human Rights Campaign and listed his employer as the Marquis Group also donated to Democratic congressional candidates Gina Ortiz Jones (Tex.), Jennifer Wexton (Va.), Nancy Soderberg (Fla.), and Annie Craig (Minn.). There is no evidence Cox has donated to any other 2020 Democratic presidential candidate.

Nonetheless, CNN failed to detail Cox’s status as a Warren donor. This, as Free Beacon notes, would not be the first time CNN has come under fire for failing to sufficiently disclose the affiliations of its town hall attendees:

The lack of disclosure comes after CNN was criticized in February for not disclosing the Democratic Party ties of town hall participants who asked harsh questions of outsider presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), including identifying the Baltimore County Democratic Party chairwoman as a “former biology professor.”

The network admitted that it “should have more fully identified any political affiliations” following the town hall controversy in February.

“Though we said at the beginning of the Town Hall that the audience was made up of Democrats and Independents, we should have more fully identified any political affiliations,” a CNN spokesperson told Fox News at the time."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) subtly reminisced her days as a registered Republican. She answered a question about a “surprise” friendship that impacted her and her beliefs by talking about her relationship with “deeply principled Republican” Charles Fried — who served as Solicitor General from 1985-1989 — and her three brothers, two of whom are Republicans.

Candidates at the Ohio Democrat debate on Tuesday were asked, “What friendship have you had that would surprise us, and what impact has it had on you and your beliefs?”

“Twenty-seven years ago, when I was under consideration for a job,” Warren began, mentioning Fried, whom she described as “a deeply principled Republican.”

“We didn’t agree on much. I was far more liberal than he was,” Warren said.

Notably, Warren was a registered Republican 27 years ago. She did not change her party affiliation to Democrat until 1996.

“But he also was willing to listen to my work about what’s happening to America’s middle class, and Charles engaged with it over and over and ultimately is the person who made sure that I got the job,” Warren continued before pivoting to her Republican brothers.

“You know, I grew up out in Oklahoma. I have three older brothers. They all served in the military. Two of the three are still Republicans. I love all three of my brothers. And there are a lot of things that we’re divided on, but there are core things that we believe in together,” the presidential hopeful said.

She continued:

We want to see all of our children get a good start in life. We don’t want to see any of our friends or neighbors not get covered by health care. We’re willing to get out there for the things we believe in. Look, people across this country — whether they’re Democrats, independents, or Republicans — they know what’s broken. They know that we have an America that’s working better and better and better for a thinner and thinner and thinner slice at the top and leaving everyone else behind. People across this country, regardless of party, are ready to say, “No more. We want an America that works for everyone.”

“2020 is our moment in history. It’s a deep honor to be here to be in this fight. I know what’s broken. I know how to fix it, and we are building a grassroots movement to get it done that includes everyone,” she concluded."

WARREN: ‘In Syria, he has created a bigger than ever humanitarian crisis.’ #DemDebate — NowThis (@nowthisnews) October 16, 2019

However, the conflict in Yemen — which the Obama administration first began supporting Saudi Arabia in fighting — is a far bigger humanitarian crisis.

Trump this week withdrew about 1,000 U.S. forces from northern Syria in the face of an oncoming Turkish invasion into northern Syria.

Democrats accused the president of abandoning a U.S. ally, since U.S. forces fought alongside Syrian Democratic Forces to help defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in Syria.

According to Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, there have been 250,000 displaced by Turkey’s invasion, and at least 71 civilians killed since the beginning of the invasion.

However, the continuing conflict in Yemen — which the Obama administration first began supplying Saudi Arabia military support for — is a far bigger humanitarian crisis.

There are between one million to two million Kurds in Syria, according to the New York Times.

However, there are more than ten times the number of Yemenis who are in need of humanitarian assistance.

Approximately 24 million Yemenis — about 80 percent of the population — are in need of humanitarian assistance from the Saudi-led war in Yemen against the Iran-backed Houthis, and millions more have been displaced by the fighting in Yemen, according to the Voice of America.

The United Nations has called the crisis in Yemen “the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.”

The UN estimates that about 10 children die per day in Yemen from diseases caused by hunger, and there has been an outbreak of cholera resulting in more than a million cases and about 3,000 deaths since the fighting began in 2014.

Save the Children estimates that 85,000 Yemeni children under the age of 5 may have died of starvation.

Coulter spoke with Breitbart News Tonight host and Senior Editor-at-Large Rebecca Mansour on Monday about the Democrat primary candidates, noting their embrace of the ultra-left:

“All you need to do is keep tape recording these Democrat debates,” Coulter said, adding, “I would just have clips from that transgender debate”– a reference to the Human Rights Campaign’s LGBT town hall hosted by CNN last week.

Warren made waves during the LGBT town hall after applauding a nine-year-old transgender child and providing a snippy answer to a question on faith and traditional marriage.

Morgan Cox III – the chair of the HRC board of directors and a max Warren donor – a detail CNN failed to disclose – asked the presidential hopeful what she would say to a supporter who says their faith teaches them that marriage is between a man and a woman.

“Well, I’m going to assume it’s a guy who said that,” Warren said. “And I’m going to say, ‘Then just marry one woman.’ I’m cool with that.”

“Assuming you can find one,” she quipped, in an attempt to “burn” men of faith who embrace traditional Jude0-Christian values:

“Can you imagine,” she said of her response.

Both Mansour and Coulter agree with Warren’s call to rein in the excesses of Wall Street, but Coulter warned that all of that will go out of the window if the Massachusetts senator becomes president.

“It’s the super woke coo-coo stuff that– she’s gone so far woke, that it’s a total turnoff,” Mansour said.

Coulter concurred, adding, “Those of you listening to us who agree with Rebecca and me on hating Wall Street– I promise you. If Elizabeth Warren got elected, suddenly she’d forget about all the Wall Street stuff and it would just be pedal to the metal on transgenders.”"

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) suggested that politicians cannot pretend to take on Big Tech and big pharmaceutical corporations after taking their donations — something Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) has continued to do throughout her run for president.

After Harris demanded that tech corporations like Twitter ban President Trump from their platforms, Warren touted that she, unlike Harris, has refused to take donations from Big Tech and Big Pharma.

Harris, despite claiming that she will fight Big Tech and Big Pharma companies if elected, has taken donor money from employees of the country’s biggest tech conglomerates and pharmaceutical executives, as Breitbart News has detailed.

In fact, Harris’s campaign has been almost exclusively propped up by a base of elite coastal donors with less than 40 percent of her funding coming from small-dollar donors giving $200 or less. The majority of Harris’s donations, more than 56 percent, have come from large-dollar donors giving $200 or more.

Harris’s top donors include lawyers from the Paul, Weiss, et al. law firm, which has represented Citigroup, as well as American job outsourcers and offshorers such as the Walt Disney Company; multinational communications services AT&T; Alphabet Inc., which is the parent corporation of Google; as well as Apple Inc.

In May, billionaire Gordon Getty of the Getty Oil dynasty hosted a fundraiser for Harris at his mansion in San Francisco, California, with Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA). Campaign records find that the billionaire Getty family has contributed thousands to Harris.

Likewise, though Harris’s campaign has claimed that she does not accept funding from Big Pharma, a number of pharmaceutical executives have gifted the California senator with campaign cash, The Intercept notes:

Donors include Therese Meaney, a vice president at Endo Pharmaceuticals, a company that manufacturers opioid painkillers, who has given $1,250 to the Harris campaign; Ted Love, the president and chief executive of Global Blood Therapeutics, a startup biopharmaceutical company, who gave $2,800; J. Dana Hughes, a vice president at Pfizer, gave $250; Damian Wilmot, an executive at Vertex Pharmaceuticals, gave $1,000; and Jeffrey Stein, the chief executive of Cidara Therapeutics, another drug startup, who gave $1,000.

Silicon Valley’s tech elites have been major contributors to Harris’s bid as she has campaigned against slapping tariffs on the foreign-made products of tech corporations.

Seven Facebook executives and employees have donated $1,000 or more to Harris’s campaign, while nearly 20 Google executives and employees have donated more than $1,000, four Twitter executives and employees have donated more than $1,000, and 71 Amazon executives and employees have donated anywhere from $5 to $2,000.

The Walt Disney Company’s Craig Hunegs, who heads Disney Television Studios, is one of Harris’s top donors, giving nearly $6,000 to her campaign. California real estate developer John Dinapoli, Coastal Healthcare Services President Quiana Mitchem, and New York Attorney Fraser Hunter Jr. have all donated more than $5,000 to Harris as well.

“At least Bernie’s being honest here in saying how he’s going to pay for this. Taxes are going to go up,” Klobuchar said. “I think we owe it to the American people as to where we send the invoice.”

Klobuchar explained to Warren that a public option is necessary to bring down healthcare premium costs of those covered and said that Warren’s plan fails to do that.

“The boldest idea here is not to trash Obamacare but to do what Obama wanted to do from the beginning, and that’s have a public option to bring down the cost of the premium and expand the cost of the covered and take on the pharmaceutical companies,” she said. “That is what we should be doing instead of kick 149 million people off their insurance in four years.”

“I appreciate Elizabeth’s work, but the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done,” she added.

Earlier in the debate, Warren was asked a yes or no question as to whether she would raise healthcare costs in her Medicare for All plan. She responded that costs will go up for the rich and down for those who are not.

—

10:45 PM: Cooper, after discussing Ellen and Dubya hanging out at a Cowboys game, asks candidates about a friendship that they have had that would surprise people or had an impact on them. Serious question: Did Cooper or CNN producers watch Phil Mickelson’s “Tribute Tuesday” Instagram posts before asking this typical MSM question? Nothing MSM loves more than “unity” and “bipartisanship.”

Castro: Rambles about people who thought differently and grew up differently. Doesn’t name anyone. Castro says we should be kind to people but should also hold people to account like George W. Bush.

Gabbard: Names Republicans like Trey Gowdy. Says Gowdy has been there for her during some personally challenging times.

Klobuchar: Names McCain.

Steyer: A woman from Denmark, South Carolina, who is fighting for clean water and environmental justice. Different race, gender, and from a different part of the country.

Beto: Says he has always tried to bring people together. Names retiring Rep. Will Hurd (R-TX).

Booker: He says he has so many he can’t count… goes to Bible study in Sen. Inhofe’s (R-OK) office and went to dinner with Sen. Cruz (R-TX).

Yang: After saying he will spend ten hours answering questions on his website on Friday, names “Fred the Felon,” a white working-class truck driver who previously supported Trump and now supports Yang.

Harris: Rand Paul. Talks about how they joined together on a bill to end cash bail.

Mayor Pete: Talks about friendships formed in the military–different race, politics.

Warren: Harvard Law Prof. Charles Fried.

Sanders: McCain for working with him on veterans issues.

Biden: McCain. Whacks Trump for being a “liar” and a “cheat.”

10:30 PM: Biden says he’s the only one on the stage who has gotten anything really big done.

Sanders rips Biden — says he got the Iraq War, NAFTA, PNTR (permanent normal trade relations) with China done.

Oh Bernie with the combo on Biden and all the bad things (Iraq, bankruptcy bill) he got done. Bam bam bam. — Matt Stoller (@matthewstoller) October 16, 2019

Warren takes credit for the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Board (CFPB).

10:23 PM: Biden says he won’t pack the Supreme Court to protect abortion rights. Biden talks about defeating Robert Bork and says we should codify Roe v Wade. Biden says if a Supreme Court Justice steps down before the next election, Mitch McConnell and the Republicans should not be allowed to hold hearings.

Buttigieg wants a 15-person Supreme Court to depoliticize the process. He says 5 members will be appointed only with the unanimous consent of 10 others.

Castro calls for term limits (or cycling off to the appellate courts) rather than packing the courts.

Warren takes the question back to abortion and says she lived in an America where abortion was illegal and rich women still got abortions. She says poor women were the ones who got hurt.

10: 09 PM: Booker, interjecting, says as the vegan, he can say that Trump is the unhealthiest person to ever run for president.

10:06 PM: Yang says Warren is 100% accurate in diagnosing the problem when asked about breaking up tech companies. Yang says breaking up tech companies, though, will not revive Main Street. He talks about the impact of screen use on children and he says breaking up tech companies does nothing to make kids healthier. Yang says using 20th century anti-trust solutions will not work.

Warren says companies can be the umpire or have a team, but you don’t get to do both. She accuses Amazon of collecting data on what sells well on their site and then going into business against them.

Beto wants tech companies to be treated as publishers, but he does not think presidents should target individual companies.

Harris asks Warren to join her in calling for Twitter to shut down Trump’s Twitter account. Warren dodges and says she wants to push Trump out of the White House.

Steyer now says Democrats need to talk about “prosperity” and the “private sector” to beat Trump before calling Trump a “fraud.” If traction gets any traction, will be interesting to see Democrats hit back at his private equity past.

Yang says data is more valuable than oil and Americans need to get their “tech check” via the freedom dividend, and that’s the best way to deal with the Big Tech problem.

9:52 PM: Burnett tries to pivot to health and Sanders says he’s feeling great. Booker says Sanders supports medical marijuana and Sanders replies: “I’m not on it tonight.”

Burnett asks Sanders how he will assure voters that he is up for the presidency. Sanders talks about an upcoming rally in Queens and says he will mount a “vigorous campaign” to prove to people that he is fit for the presidency.

He thanks everyone who sent good wishes from the bottom of his heart and says he is so glad to be back up on the debate stage.

Biden says he is running because of his “age and experience” because with it comes “wisdom.” He says now, more than ever, someone with that capacity is needed in the White House.

Warren, when asked about age, says she will outwork, out-organize, and outlast everyone–and “that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with.”

9:50 PM: On opioids, Steyer goes back to one of the central themes of his campaign–that corporations have bought the government.

Yang calls for decriminalizing opioids. He says there were more opioid prescriptions than people in Ohio and the crisis is one of “capitalism run amok.” He says the government must invest in treatment plans and people cannot be worried about going to jail cells if they come in for treatment. He says first responders in New Hampshire have told him they see the same people over and over again.

Beto also says he is for decriminalization of opioids while Harris calls pharmaceutical companies and executives “high-level dope dealers” and says some executives need to go to jail. “This is a matter of justice,” she says, adding that we should end mass incarceration and the War on Drugs and go after pharmaceutical executives.

Castro says drug company executives should go to jail and also need to be held accountable financially. He says Wall Street executives also must be held to account.

9:40 PM: Warren in favor of voluntary buyback programs and not mandatory buyback programs. She says the former got machine guns off the streets.

Castro asked about preventing deaths via handguns. Castro says he has problems with mandatory buyback programs because people don’t want cops coming to their homes… talks about police officers killing innocent people in their homes. He says “police violence is also gun violence, and we need to address that.”

9:30 PM: Beto asked about mandatory buybacks. He has disagreed with Mayor Pete on this.

Beto asked how he would endorse that when he doesn’t even know who has AR-15s. Beto calls them “weapons of war” that are “too dangerous to sell.” Beto says they are also “too dangerous to own” because every single one of them is a “potential instrument of terror.” He says just ask “any Hispanic in Texas” and accused Trump of inciting racists to target Hispanics in his community. Beto says if someone does not turn in their “weapons of war” and “brandishes” it in public, that weapon “will be taken from them.”

Buttigieg asked whether mandatory buybacks equal “confiscation.” He says Beto just made it clear that he does not know how to get weapons off the street. Mayor Pete says we can’t wait for Red Flag laws and universal background checks. He says we can’t wait for purity test and must “get something done.”

Mayor Pete says he doesn’t need lessons from Beto on courage–political or personal. He goes on to rip the NRA and their “enablers” in Congress. Beto hits Mayor Pete for calling his buyback plan a “shiny object.” He says “that was a slap in the face” to every survivor of gun violence.

9:22 PM: Castro rips Trump for caging kids at the border while letting ISIS prisoners go free. He says there is no reason for Kim Jong Un to trust anything Trump has to say re: nuclear agreement when he ripped up the Iran Deal and betrayed the Kurds.

Booker accuses Trump of partnering more with Putin than Merkel and Macron.

Biden says he has spent time alone with Putin and Erdogan. He says Trump is an “erratic” and “crazy” president who doesn’t “know a damn” about foreign policy. Biden says Erdogan knows how terrible it would if Turkey got booted from NATO. Biden says if Trump is elected, there will be no NATO.

Biden counters Gabbard’s “regime-change” war claim, saying it was to prevent Assad from “wiping out” thousands of people.

Beto says Russia is “invading” American democracy and then says “in addition” in Spanish out of the blue.

9:12 PM: Gabbard, appropriately asked about Syria.

She says Trump “has the blood of the Kurds on his hand.” She rips both parties and the mainstream media for “championing” the regime-change war that has led to the death of the Kurds. She rips CNN and the New York Times for smearing veterans like her for wanting to end the “regime-change war” in Syria. Says it is “despicable” that CNN had a pundit who implied she was a “Russia asset.”

Gabbard asks Warren to join her in calling for an end to the regime-change wars.

Warren says she doesn’t want troops in the Middle East but America must do it in the right way. She then accuses Trump of sucking up to dictators and enriching himself at the expense of America. She accuses Trump of giving ISIS a “new lease on life.”

Gabbard rips Buttigieg for wanting more regime-change wars in Syria. The two veterans differing. Buttigieg says when he was deployed, what protected him was that the American flag meant keeping our word and says Trump is undermining the “honor” of our soldiers. He says if you take away their honor, you might as well take away their armor.

Sanders says Turkey is no longer a U.S. ally when they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter. Sanders says 11,000 Kurds died and 20,000 were wounded fighting ISIS and now no country will trust the word of the United States. Sanders says Trump, the “pathological liar,” has wrecked the country’s ability to engage with other nations re: foreign policy issues.

KAMALA makes it clear – there are 4 winners because of what Donald Trump has done: 1) Russia

2) Iran

3) Assad

4) ISIS — Lily Adams (@adamslily) October 16, 2019

9:10 PM: Debate turns to foreign policy. Biden says he would not have withdrawn troops from Syria or Iraq. He says when Trump said the ISIS prisoners who are freed would go to Europe, it is the most shameful thing ever said by a modern president. Biden says he will make it clear to Syria’s Assad that “Turkey is the real problem here.” When asked if he wants American troops back in Syria, Biden says he wants the 1,000 troops protected by air cover and will make it clear that they are not going anywhere and will protect the Kurds.

9:05: Interesting observation:

No candidate has attacked Biden tonight, even though he remains the front-runner, at least technically. They see that his campaign is deflating. Warren is the real threat. — Robert Reich (@RBReich) October 16, 2019

9:00 PM: Castro wants an inheritance tax and to raise the top marginal rate. He talks about having visited homeless people living in storm drains in Vegas.

Booker wants Democrats to talk more about child poverty. He says the country must deal with the “moral obscenity” of its high child poverty rate.

8:55 PM: Harris now being asked about her tax credit. She tells a story about her mom at the kitchen table “trying to figure out how to make it all work.” Harris again repeats lines from her stump speech about how “justice is on the ballot.”

Burnett asks Yang about the wealth tax. He says it makes a lot of sense in principle but countries have repealed it because it had massive implementation problems. Yang calls for a value-added tax (VAT). Again, credit to Burnett for bringing in Yang into the discussion.

Beto says Democrats need to be more focused on lifting people on… he says Warren is more focused on “being punitive” and pitting some part of the country against the other.

Warren says she doesn’t “have a beef” with billionaires. She says billionaires made it because “all of us” helped them get there. She again calls for them to “pitch in” two cents so every other kids gets a chance.

(Bernie’s national press secretary, though, does have a “beef” with billionaires):

8:50 PM: Buttigieg, on Warren’s wealth tax, says it sounds good but could be an example of yet another Washington policy that sounds great but will accomplish nothing. Warren keeps defending her wealth tax, says it is needed for investments in the next generation. Yang has been making the case that it will be so easy for people to game the wealth tax, perhaps even renouncing citizenship, to avoid paying it but he has yet to jump in to make that point.

8:45 PM: Beto says if Mexicans should join unions if their companies do business with America.

Biden wants to double the capital gains tax and says the problem with these debates is that everyone wants to cram everything in in a short amount of time. Biden says the greedy corporations and the Fourth Industrial revolution creating job losses.

8:35 PM: Warren says the top reason Americans have lost jobs is bad trade policies and corporations with no loyalty to America workers, consumers, and communities.

8:30 PM: Debate now turns to jobs and automation. And Erin Burnett goes to Sanders first and asks him about his jobs guarantee program. Sanders says “damn right” everyone will get a job. Yang and Sanders have disagreed on this issue. Yang says his freedom dividend is more practical than Sanders’s jobs program.

Yang points out that not everyone wants to work for the federal government and many people who lose their jobs to automation cannot be “retrained” for various federal jobs. He says $1,000/month is better for the “trickle up economy.”

YANG, on jobs: 'Most Americans do not want to work for the federal government… If we put the money into our hands, we can build a trickle-up economy.' #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/3PO4RBpMt8 — NowThis (@nowthisnews) October 16, 2019

Booker jumps in to rip CNN for asking Biden about Hunter and says Trump was happy with that exchange. Says CNN elevated a lie and attacked a statesman.

Yang talks about the impact that automation will have on various communities that rely on truck drivers (diners). Gabbard is against a federal jobs guarantee and agrees with her friend Yang about UBI.

An important segment about automation and the new economy in a state that will be impacted by it would not have been possible had it not been for Yang’s candidacy. Credit to Erin Burnett for outstanding questioning and going to Yang right after Sanders and getting them to talk about their difference. Great segment for Burnett.

8:20 PM: Warren asked a “yes or no” answer about whether she will raise taxes for Medicare for all. Another dodge. She says costs will go up for the wealthy and down for those who are not. She rips insurance companies for “pulling the rug” from under people.

Buttigieg points out Warren is being evasive and says she is why why people are frustrated with Washington. Buttigieg says Warren supposedly has a plan for everything except for health care. He touts his “Medicare for all who want it” idea.

Warren says when someone hears “Medicare for all who want it,” it means “Medicare for all who can afford it.”

Sanders says his Medicare for All plan that Warren endorsed will be better than Canada’s but taxes will go up and will go up “significantly for the wealthy.” Warren keeps dodging the question and Klobuchar calls her out for not being honest and promoting a “pipe dream.”

Warren pivots to saying she spent most of her time not in Washington but studying how people went bankrupt–most due to healthcare bills even though they had insurance. Warren keeps dodging.

Biden talks again about building on Obamacare. Biden says Democrats must be straight with Americans on the single most important issue.

Sanders says the debate should be about whether Democrats have the “guts” to stand up to the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. Sanders says we must stop defending the “cruel” and “unjust” system.

Harris says Democrats should be talking more about abortion and says women, especially women of color, will die because of Republican legislatures in the states.

Kamala Harris: ""It's not an exaggeration to say women will die — poor women, women of color will die — because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with their bodies"" #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/rtyjHfQnBT — CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 16, 2019

8:16 PM: Cooper asks Biden about his son Hunter. He asks if it is not okay for a president’s son to be involved in foreign businesses, why is it okay for a vice president’s son. Biden says neither he nor his son did “nothing wrong.” “My son’s statement speaks for itself,” Biden says, basically cuing up a potential attack ad. Biden says Trump is afraid of him because if he wins the nomination he will “beat him like a drum.” Biden says he and his son kept everything separate. Says Hunter made a judgment and he is “prod” of the judgment he made. Biden then pivots back to Trump’s “corruption.”

Sanders says Democrats must also focus on the “pain of the working class of this country.”

8:06 PM: Biden, who finally came around on impeachment, says Democrats have been fair and he agrees with Sanders that Trump is the most corrupt president in history.

Harris says Trump has committed crimes in “plain sight.” Cites Maya Angelou. She also accuses Trump of “selling out” working people, national security, and democracy. Harris, reciting her greatest Twitter hits, says as a prosecutor she knows a confession when she sees it and says the impeachment process won’t take long. She says Trump is the most corrupt and unpatriotic president.

Booker says impeachment has to be about “patriotism” and not “partisanship.” He says Democrats have to conduct this process in a way that is “honorable” and “doesn’t rip us apart.” Says Trump has violated his duty.

Now, for some reason, Cooper goes to Klobuchar, who is barely registering in the polls. She accuses Trump of “illegal conduct” for “digging up dirt” on an opponent. She says Trump has left the Kurds “for slaughter.” She says Trump has made “Russia great again.”

Castro says Democrats can “walk and chew gum at the same time” when asked if impeachment is a distraction. He says Trump is violating his oath of office and abusing his power.

Buttigieg says Trump has left Congress “no choice” but to launch an impeachment inquiry. He says the impeachment inquiry is about whether, when people look back 100 years from now, a president was above the law and could get away with anything. He presents himself as the bipartisan candidate.

Gabbard says impeachment will divide the country if driven by “hyper-partisan interests.”

Steyer says every candidate on stage is more decent and patriotic than “the criminal in the White House.” He talks about starting his Need to Impeach movement two years ago.

Yang supports impeachment (implies Senate will not convict) but says impeachment will not solve the issues that got Donald Trump elected. Pivots to the central theme of his campaign about Fourth Industrial Revolution. Yang says Democrats “are losing” when they are talking about Trump.

Beto says he thinks about everyone who has ever served in uniform and says we have a responsibility to be “fearless in the face of this president’s criminality and lawlessness.”

8:05 PM: Sanders says Democrats have “no choice” but to impeach Trump because Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country. He thinks the House will find him worthy of impeachment because of the Emoluments Clause. He says Trump is using the Oval Office to enrich himself. Sanders says Mitch McConnell must do the right thing and allow free and fair trial in the Senate.

8:00 PM: Debate begins. First question (for Warren) is about impeachment. Warren says the impeachment inquiry is necessary during an election year because some things are bigger than politics. She cites the Mueller report (obstruction of justice) and says “look what happened as a result” of not opening an impeachment inquiry after the Mueller report was released. Warren says this is also about the next president and the next president…

7:55 PM: Cooper introducing the candidates as the debate is about to get started.

7:36 PM: DNC Chair Tom Perez thinks Democrats can take back Ohio in 2020. Democrats want Ohio to be the state that ends Trump’s presidency. Perez rips Trump and says the election is not about “left versus right” but about “right versus wrong.”

7:35 PM: Watch what Ohio residents think of Democrats–Video from Breitbart’s Matt perdie and Zenny phuong in Ohio:

7:30 PM: CNN hyping the number of candidates (12) on stage as if it is a good thing.

Is the word out that Dems are not allowed to talk about Hunter Biden at the debate? If he did nothing wrong taking those jobs, why’d he promise not to do it again?

The Drudge Poll — framed with the simple question “WHO WON THE SIXTH DEM DEBATE” — is not scientific in its methodology and does not prevent multiple votes from respondents. However, as with the 2016 Republican primary, its results often indicate genuine enthusiasm from a candidate’s fan base. Corporate media and establishment pundits mocked then-candidate Donald Trump’s consistent Drudge Poll dominance, but those results ultimately matched the results of the race.

Tuesday’s poll shows many of the candidates separated by less than one percentage point.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MA) came in right behind Warren with 6.45 percent support, followed by Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Tom Steyer, Beto O’Rourke, and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with 6.1 percent, 3.69 percent, 3.33 percent, 2.06 percent, and 1.25 percent, respectively.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who desperately needed a breakout moment, came in second to last with 1.2 percent support. Julián Castro failed to top one percent as of midnight.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and S… [+5902 chars]","Despite efforts to draw distinctions between each other, the leading 2020 Democrat presidential primary candidates are unified to bring more immigration, and thus more labor market competition for American workers, to the United States if elected.",2019-10-15,Breitbart News,Leading 2020 Dems Unified to Turn Red States Blue with More Immigration,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/14/2020-democrats-unified-for-more-immigration/,"Despite efforts to draw distinctions between each other, the leading 2020 Democrat presidential primary candidates are unified to bring more immigration, and thus more labor market competition for American workers, to the United States if elected.

Though polling among all U.S. voters, and particularly with swing voters, finds campaigning for immigration, illegal and legal, is the most unpopular policy position, leading candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) have gone above and beyond past Democrat candidates in their vows to drive a large migration to the country.

That increase in immigration would likely have significant consequences for states like Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia. As research by the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Axios, experts, and demographers has repeatedly discovered, an increase in the foreign-born population via immigration inevitably translates to an increase in likely Democrat voters.

At current legal immigration levels, the U.S. is already on track to bring at least 15 million new foreign-born voters to the country in the next decade. These voters’ swing towards Democrats has already been realized in the 2016 presidential election, where despite winning almost 50 percent of native-born Americans, Trump lost foreign-born voters to Hillary Clinton by 64 percent.

Elizabeth Warren

Warren has portrayed her run for president as a populist movement, similar to that of Sanders’ and Trump’s campaigns in the 2016 presidential election, but her immigration platform is a carbon copy of the donor class’s and Washington, D.C. beltway’s longtime effort to force down wages for Americans by increasing legal immigration levels.

Aside from promising to decriminalize illegal immigration and provide free taxpayer-funded healthcare to all 11 to 22 million illegal aliens, Warren is seeking to gift the big business lobby with a massive increase in legal immigration — levels which are already historically high, as at least 1.2 million legal immigrants are added to the U.S. population every year.

That increase in legal immigration, Warren has said, will include an increase in chain migration, whereby newly naturalized citizens are allowed to bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S. Today, chain migration makes up more than 70 percent of all legal immigration, and in the last decade the process has brought almost 10 million foreign nationals to the U.S.

Like her legal immigration agenda, Warren plans to surge refugee resettlement to the country by at least 700 percent. As Breitbart News has chronicled, mass fraud is prevalent in the refugee system, with African refugees often fraudulently obtaining refugee status.

Joe Biden

Biden has been less direct about his plan to increase immigration to the U.S.

Like the majority of 2020 Democrats, he has endorsed providing free taxpayer-funded healthcare to illegal aliens, a plan that healthcare experts have said will drive a migration of illegal aliens with “serious health problems” to the country.

Biden’s strategy to increase immigration, though, has been to provide green cards to all foreign students who graduate from American universities and to bring as many legal immigrants to the country as feasibly possible — regardless of its impacts on U.S. citizens and workers.

Biden said in August:

We could afford to take in a heartbeat another two million people. The idea that a country of 330 million people cannot absorb people who are in desperate need … is absolutely bizarre … I would also move to increase the total number of immigrants able to come to the United States.”

In 2013, while speaking to the financial industry, Biden touted a plan to increase the number of H-1B foreign visa workers that corporations are allowed to import to replace American workers.

Every year, more than 100,000 foreign workers are brought to the U.S. on the H-1B visa and are allowed to stay for up to six years. There are about 650,000 H-1B visa foreign workers in the U.S. at any given moment. Americans are often laid off in the process and forced to train their foreign replacements, as highlighted by Breitbart News. More than 85,000 Americans annually potentially lose their jobs to foreign labor through the H-1B visa program.

Bernie Sanders

Sanders has on occasion denounced the idea of open borders, calling such a policy a “Koch brothers proposal” to drive down the wages of American workers by forcing them to compete against the world’s workforce.

“It would make everybody in America poorer,” Sanders said in 2015 of open borders. Sanders has revisited that sentiment in his 2020 presidential campaign — even calling for more detention space for border crossers to end Catch and Release — but his broader immigration plan reflects that of the open borders lobby.

For example, Sanders’ latest plan ends deportations of illegal aliens and border crossers, decriminalizes illegal immigration, and promotes the DREAM Act, which would provide amnesty to the majority of illegal aliens currently living in the U.S., creating a new flood of legalized foreign labor that American workers would be forced to compete against.

Where Sanders has differed from his two top contenders is on his plan to make subtle changes to the H-1B visa system and prevent American workers from having to compete against illegal aliens for U.S. jobs.

Like Trump, Sanders has warned against corporations using the H-1B visa program to import cheaper foreign workers instead of hiring qualified and job-ready Americans.

Out of all the 2020 Democrats running for president, Sanders is the only candidate who earns a “mixed” review from NumbersUSA’s scorecard, the organization that tracks the records of politicians on whether or not they support less immigration to boost wages and job opportunities for Americans.

Sanders is the only 2020 Democrat that has mostly endorsed nationwide mandatory E-Verify to ban U.S. companies from hiring illegal aliens over American citizens. Nonetheless, Sanders’ support for mass amnesty, critics have said, will mean that those illegal aliens currently in the country would be able to eventually compete against Americans in the workforce and pass through the E-Verify system.

Warren: 33 percent Trump: 38.8 percent

Sanders: 32.5 percent Trump 39.1 percent

Harris 28.4 percent Trump: 39 percent

Buttigieg: 27 percent

One of the most significant narratives moving into the 2020 election is the state of the economy, which Trump has touted as one of his greatest accomplishments. Of those surveyed, 13.7 percent described the condition of the economy as “excellent,” 28.7 percent described it as “good,” and 33.1 percent described it as “fair.” Only 13.3 percent described the condition of the economy as “poor.”

Trump won North Carolina in 2016 with 49.8 percent of the vote to Hillary Clinton’s 46.2 percent. While Republicans hold an edge in the state, former President Barack Obama flipped the state blue in 2008, beating late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) by less than half of a percentage point."

Instead, debate moderators focused largely on impeachment, gun control, health care, and abortion.

Various 2020 Democrats have vowed to implement the most open borders agenda in the history of the country with candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) promising to decriminalize illegal immigration and the majority endorsing a plan to force American taxpayers to provide free health care to all illegal aliens.

The lack of questions on immigration to 2020 Democrats comes as swing voters are increasingly turned off by the candidates’ plans to bring millions of more foreign workers to the U.S.

The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds that the 2020 Democrats’ health care for illegal aliens plan is the most unpopular policy position thus far in the race for president, with opposition from 62 percent of all likely voters.

Polling from Harvard/Harris reveals among all U.S. voters, and particularly with swing voters, that presidential candidates campaigning for immigration, illegal and legal, is the most unpopular policy position.

Amy Klobuchar (D-MN); and South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg — did well in the fourth Democrat debate on Tuesday evening.

However, even the “moderate” candidates support radical policies — such as extreme tax hikes, for example.

The moderators asked several candidates whether they would support a “wealth tax” — a tax on what Americans have saved after already paying other taxes, such as income taxes. (Neither CNN nor the New York Times hosts pointed to any authorization in the U.S. Constitution for a tax on wealth. The Sixteenth Amendment was needed merely to authorize taxes on income; a wealth tax is a direct tax not apportioned by state, and therefore illegal.

Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), recognized as the leaders in the “progressive” lane, have both proposed wealth taxes. But on Tuesday, so did most of the “moderate” candidates on the debate stage.

Buttigieg declared: “I’m all for a wealth tax.” Klobuchar answered: “I am open to it. It could work.”

Only Biden opposed it — but he pushed for a doubling of the capital gains tax, to 39.5% — which would make the U.S. tax rate on investments one of the highest in the world, pushing money offshore to less punitive countries.

It was left to Andrew Yang to point out that wealth taxes had failed everywhere: “It’s been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all those countries ended up repealing it because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue projected.

“We should not be looking to other countries’ mistakes,” Yang added.

Biden criticized his Democrat rival Elizabeth Warren for being vague, but ended up sounding more vague in the process. “Part of that requires you not being vague,” Biden said. When asked to explain what he meant, he meandered on for several seconds talking about the different costs of healthcare.

7. Age is wisdom

When asked about his age, Biden said that his advanced age gave him “wisdom” to be president.

“One of the reasons I’m running is because of my age and my experience,” he said. “With it comes wisdom. We need someone to take office this time around who on day one can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders.”

Biden struggled throughout the night to demonstrate that his advanced age made him more qualified to be president than any of the younger candidates."

The Washington Post stated Tuesday that Ocasio-Cortez is expected to announce her support for Sanders’s White House bid alongside the senator on Saturday at his first rally since suffering a heart attack two weeks ago.

“We’re looking forward to Saturday,” Ocasio-Cortez spokesperson Corbin Trent teased in a statement.

During tonight’s CNN-New York Times’ Democrat presidential debate, Sanders teased that he would have a “special guest” at his “Bernie’s back” rally in Queens, New York.

“The endorsement could be a blow for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who, like Sanders, is running on a platform of sweeping liberal change and who has emphasized her role as a female pioneer,” notes the Post.

Ocasio-Cortez worked as a volunteer organizer for Sanders’s 2016 campaign.

The development comes after Sanders said that he “misspoke” when he told reporters he may slow his frenetic campaigning pace after a recent heart attack.

The Vermont senator backtracked in an interview with NBC News just a day after indicating that health concerns would force him to change “the nature” of his campaign, in the short term, at least.

“We’re going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign,” Sanders told NBC, downplaying the impact of the heat attack, which required him to be rushed to the hospital where he received two stents to clear a clogged artery in his heart.

“People should think that I had a procedure which hundreds of thousands of people a year have,” Sanders continued. “People should think that according to the doctors I’m on the way to a full recovery.”

The 78-year-old self-described democratic socialist was hospitalized after experiencing chest discomfort while campaigning in Las Vegas last week. His staff initially said the stents were inserted for a blocked artery, revealing only two days later that he had had a heart attack.

Sanders told NBC it was “nonsense” to suggest his staff hadn’t been forthright about his condition. He said he was still talking to doctors and trying to understand what was going on.

“My son did nothing wrong,” Biden declared. “I did nothing wrong.”

He explained:

“Look, the fact that George Washington on the first time he spoke after being elected, that we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections, it was the greatest threat to America. This president on three occasions, three occasions, has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous. Rudy Giuliani, the president and his thugs have already proven that they, in fact, are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn’t want me to be the candidate. He is going after me because he knows if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.”

In his attempt to recap Biden’s meandering answer, Noah said that he understood what Biden meant but that it “took a while for him to get there.”

“OK, one minute he’s talking about his son, then George Washington, then something about the seventeenth?” the Comedy Central host remarked. “Joe Biden is the only candidate who remixes his speech while he’s giving it.”

After mocking the number of candidates on the debate stage, Noah also described the “weirdest part of the night” as when Kamala Harris (D-CA) “started a real-life Twitter beef” with Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) over Twitter’s refusal to ban Trump from its platform.

“I’ll be honest, I kind of understand Warren’s point here,” he explained. “We need Trump on Twitter. It’s the only way we can monitor what he’s up to. Otherwise, he’s doing that shit in secret.

Rand Paul (R-KY) is out with a new book, The Case Against Socialism, and explained his case and vision in a lengthy exclusive interview on Sirius XM’s Breitbart News Sunday this weekend.

In the interview, Paul said that from Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime in Germany to Josef Stalin’s Soviet Union to Mao Zedong’s China to Fidel Castro’s Cuba to Pol Pot’s Cambodia to Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro’s Venezuela, socialism has worse than failed in every single country it has been attempted. And while he says that modern American socialists like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) claim “they don’t want that kind of socialism” that results in “authoritarianism, genocide, and famine,” there is no case where socialism has ever worked and it always ends up there.

“I think that’s one of the questions that comes up very quickly is some people are incredulous you even have to make the case because history is replete with examples of socialism gone awry, socialism devolving into authoritarianism, genocide, and famine,” Paul said in a half-hour special that aired Sunday evening on Breitbart News Sunday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel.

“The 20th century really is the history of the failure of socialism, from Hitler’s Nazi or nationalist socialism to Stalin’s Bolshevik socialism to Mao’s socialism to Pol Pot. Really, time and time again, millions of people have died at the hands of despotic rulers,” Paul said. “Some would say today’s socialists like AOC and Bernie don’t want that kind of socialism, but actually there was a time when Bernie was very sympathetic to Castro as well as Chávez. This seems to be the pattern for today’s socialists is that they’re very, very open to socialism until they find out that it’s replaced by authoritarianism and until they find out it’s been replaced by poverty.”

Paul points to Venezuela as a key recent historical example of socialism “gone awry.”

“This is true in Venezuela in particular,” Paul said. “All the American left was in love, even people who didn’t claim to be socialists, were in love Chávez and claimed he was reducing poverty, but in the end in Venezuela it’s become so desperate that the average person has lost 20 pounds not because they intended to but for lack of food. Venezuela was once one of the richest countries—probably the richest country—in South America. They still have more oil reserves than Saudi Arabia, but there’s still shortages of food. The common people can’t eat. You see people like their leader, Maduro—their socialist leader—becoming more and more overweight; he’s probably added something like 50 pounds while the average person is losing 20 pounds. So I think you see example after example of socialism not working and devolving into state violence, but I think even more important though is we now—you think most people would know that, but what we have now is polls showing people today, especially youth, think socialism might be a good idea. You have some polls showing over 50 percent of young people thinking we ought to try socialism. So my wife and I got together and wrote this book thinking gosh, we have to remind them of the history of socialism, but we also have to remind them that socialism historically has also devolved into violence.”

Socialism, Paul argues, has taken over the Democrat Party, fueled by an angry presidential primary battle that has resulted in a “bidding war” of sorts between that party’s leaders attempting to outdo each other.

“I think it’s become a kind of a bidding war among the presidential candidates on the Democrat side,” Paul said. “One person will offer free college, and the other person will say, ‘No, free college and free benefits for paid leave,’ and then another one will say, ‘What about Medicare for All?’ So it just goes on and on and on, in sort of a bidding war on the left for who can offer more free stuff. But there needs to be an examination of who really pays for so-called ‘free stuff.’ This is one of the big lies we point out in The Case Against Socialism, is that Bernie and AOC say, ‘Oh the top one percent will pay for all this.’ But when you add it up, there’s just not enough money. What they have proposed on the top one percent would maybe bring in $50 billion, but their spending desires are closer to $60, $70, or even $80 trillion. So there’s definitely a mismatch and a math problem for these people.”

In addition to the mathematical and historical issues with socialism, Paul argues, current socialists using Scandinavian countries like Denmark and Sweden to argue socialism works are false analogies.

“But even worse, they point to the so-called socialism of Scandinavia and say, ‘Oh yeah, we used to like Chávez, we used to like Castro, we used to like the Sandinistas, but now what we really like is Scandinavian socialism,’” Paul said. “So we examine that, my wife and I did a great deal of research and we examined Scandinavian socialism and what we came up with is interestingly they are not socialist. They have private property; most of the businesses are owned privately. They have a private stock exchange. In fact, the prime minister of Denmark when Bernie kept saying, ‘Denmark is this great socialist nation,’ the prime minister actually came out and said, ‘Bernie, you need to pipe down; we’re not a socialist country.’ In fact, he almost got alarm in his voice because he was worried people might not come there to do business anymore because they might think they were a socialist nation. Most of the indexes of freedom, trade, and capitalism actually rank the Scandinavian countries quite high. So really what Bernie is selling is a bill of goods here. They will then argue that the Scandinavian countries have a lot of free stuff—they do have a lot of free stuff, welfare, and state goodies that come with big government, but the interesting thing with Scandinavia is it’s much different than Bernie and AOC say. What happens in Scandinavia is the working class pay a huge amount of taxes. The working class pay a 25 percent sales tax on everything, including food, and the working class and middle class also pay income tax, whereas many in our country on the lower end are excluded from the income tax, whereas what you find over there is even at $60,000 you have a 60 percent income tax. So, really, I think it’s important that we explode the myths of American socialists that Scandinavia is socialist but also explode the myth that you can have all this free stuff and the only people that pay are the top one percent in America. There’s just not enough money, and it’s just not true.”

Paul is troubled by a rising interest in socialism among America’s youth, as evidenced by some increased support for the radical and failed ideology in recent polling, and is concerned that American young people are not learning this history in school. While he thinks some of it is just a natural tradition of Americans being more leftist when they are young and becoming more conservative as they get older, he is concerned that some of what is happening is due to a lack of education on the historical failures of socialism and misconception about what socialism really entails—government control of the means of production.

“I think there’s always been a trend for young people to be more liberal—or more open to socialism—you know the old saying was, ‘If you don’t believe in liberal policies before age 30 you don’t have a heart, but if you don’t believe in conservative polices after age 30 you don’t have a brain,’” Paul said. “There is some truth to it. When you’re younger, you live on your parents’ dole. In many ways, you are a dependent who has not necessarily seen the working world or seen what it’s like and seen that paying taxes is necessary. So I do think people become more conservative over time. It’s also true that the polls that show younger people and millennials leaning toward socialism, when they ask these young people ‘What is socialism?’ only 16 or 17 percent of them can actually answer what socialism is and socialism is traditionally defined as the state owning the means of production and you don’t have private property—there is collective ownership of things. For most young people, if they’re just reading one sentence on Twitter, I guess they’re not reading much history. Some of it is a misconception, but some of it also is a function of our schools in that I think there’s a sort of unified groupthink in schools that teaches kids that things are sort of unfair out there and that it’s a rotten world and the government is going to make things more equal and more fair. So I think some of them want to see government-enforced equality, but we make the case in The Case Against Socialism that if you want equality of outcomes you would have to have equality police.”

Paul further explains the left’s hypocrisy when it comes to a “fairness police” that he says would be necessary under a socialist system to ensure “equal outcome” by noting that it cuts against core American beliefs of “equal protection under the law.”

“You would have to have a fairness police that is going to show up with truncheons to make people fair again because any time you sort of advocate for equal outcome you basically push to make everyone equal all the time, the world is not that way,” Paul said. “You have unequal talents, some people work harder than others, some people are luckier, some people are taller, some people are smarter, some people are faster—there’s all kinds of reasons why there are not equal outcomes. But the irony is if you want to have equal outcomes the law and the government actually has to treat people unequally. You think the left would think this through, and they would realize that the whole idea of equal protection under the law—that everybody should be treated the same—is a principle that the left prided themselves in and almost everyone prides themselves in now and yet if you have equal outcomes you won’t have equal protection under the law. You actually will have to law that will treat people in an unequal way.”

Part of why Paul said there is a rush to socialism in America’s youth is a legitimate concern with political corruption in America, something grassroots movements on both the left and the right have felt for many years. There is, he said, a political, cultural, and financial elite that seems to ordinary Americans to be above the rest of society when it comes to the law and because of that corruption people challenge the system—on both sides of the political aisle. He is concerned, however, that the left’s pandering with socialism would only make the system worse because it would empower more cronyism and more corruption if ever implemented, whereas conservatives’ vision of less government cuts into the ability of bad actors to act badly.

“I think you’ve hit the nail on the head. Both left and right, the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street movement, they’re all sort of unhappy about—myself included—about crony capitalism, about people who manipulate government and manipulate the law to have an unfair advantage,” Paul said. “It’s not just that they’re selling something that people want and have become successful like Sam Walton, it’s things like some of the big pharmaceutical companies and things that come to Washington and manipulate government to enrich themselves and then abuse the rules to enrich themselves more and more. So yes I think both sides—both right and left—see this. I remember when the bankers were bailed out in 2009, these very wealthy bankers and very wealthy banks that had made rotten decisions. In the end, the poor homeowner was kicked out of his house or her house but the banks were bailed out. So the Occupy Wall Street movement was offended by that and so was the Tea Party. The real difference is the answer. It’s one thing to be angry about crony capitalism. For those on the left, it’s because crony capitalism is a failure they think we should try socialism. For those of us on the right, or the Tea Party movement, we look at crony capitalism and say that’s too much government—that’s people abusing government.”

Paul added that the right’s vision is more effective in solving the problems of corruption because it takes the power away from that handful of people who would wield it dishonorably. And that is exactly the problem with socialism, he said, as evidenced by all its historical failures: Bad actors rise up and inevitably wield said power unfairly in what ends up benefitting the few at the top and screwing over the many throughout society.

“We decided that what we wanted was less government, more of a government restrained and restricted and limited by the Constitution and less crony capitalism in a sense that what we wanted to inject was more of a free market and more voluntary transactions,” Paul said. “So it is sort of ironic that both right and left are both motivated by the same problem we see, and they come up with very different solutions and I think that’s why the book we have The Case Against Socialism is so important is because it’s about choices. It’s about voters in our country who get to think about what kind of economic system we want. And I guess our point in the book is we don’t think it’s an accident that throughout history every time socialism has been tried it has wound up in genocide and famine. The stories from Mao’s China, the stories from Pol Pot in Cambodia, the stories currently from Venezuela, I mean they are horrifying stories. People are eating their pets in Venezuela. People need to know this. The other side will complain and say that’s not real socialism, that’s a bunch of kleptocrats. And yet that’s the people who are elected, that’s their party label—they are from the socialist party—and again the apologists for socialism say ‘oh that’s not what we really want. These people now are just thugs.’ But why is it time and time again socialism devolves into thuggery? So, I think this is an important and timely book and I hope it will get the readership necessary to shape and influence some of the next generation.”

Paul added that he’s looked at experts and historical analysis to question whether socialism inevitably ends up in authoritarian regimes intent on genocide and famine, or if that just keeps happening accidentally. He argues that the experts like Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek have examined this very question and found that under socialism, ruthlessness prevails in leadership and violence becomes necessary for implementation.

“People keep getting back to this idea of whether it’s an inevitability to have this kind of authoritarianism and violence or whether it’s an accident,” Paul said. “Hayek and others looked at this, and they said it shouldn’t be looked at as a one-off or accidental in history that socialism devolves into violence because if you ultimately want to collectivize the farms as Mao did or Stalin did, if you want to take property from people, there is a point at which they will resist. Really, the leader that exhibits that most ruthless character is the one who’s able to take the land because it ultimately does require, as Lenin and others said, you’ve got to break a few eggs to make an omelette. The thing is is ultimately this is what happens. You end up choosing a few leaders; they get selected by the rest of the socialists because they are the most ruthless and willing to actually use the violence necessary to take the property. But really, our kids need to learn this history and read about it. Pol Pot was not that long ago in Cambodia with the killing fields and just hundreds and hundreds if not thousands of bodies piled in mass graves. In a very short period of time they expelled virtually everybody from the cities and ultimately millions of people were killed. This is the kind of thing that people say, ‘Oh that’s not what I want.’”

But, Paul argues, if Americans vote for socialist leadership, what ultimately happens next is evident throughout history.

“But if you’re for socialism, if you’re for the collectivization of ownership, if you believe that the collective is more important than the individual, ultimately this is what happens,” Paul said. “If you don’t think the individual is important and you disdain individual rights, then it’s sort of like it’s okay to have drone-like slaves because then what you’re about is the hive and you’re not really concerned about the individual. Our country was founded on something completely different, individual liberty. Our bill of rights is directed toward individuals not toward classifications and these are important traditions but I think it’s not being taught in school. Today’s sort of Twitter society is short attention span and not reading. I think it’s important to have the ammunition out there and we’re hoping that The Case Against Socialism will be that ammunition to help people make an informed decision and hopefully prevent America, as President Trump said, from ever becoming a socialist nation.”

Before Paul’s interview with Breitbart News, he had appeared on The View opposite, among others, Ana Navarro—the frequent critic of President Donald Trump—who shut Paul down when he was explaining what socialism was and why it was bad and why it failed in Venezuela. Paul, when asked about Navarro’s silencing of him, told Breitbart News that exposing socialism does not fit Navarro’s “narrative” of hateful opposition to President Trump—something shared by the other hosts of The View—so she would rather just not discuss these inconvenient truths at all.

“It doesn’t really fit their narrative,” Paul said. “People like Ana Navarro hate President Trump and they blame everything and they blame the poor dialogue and crassness in Washington and crass dialogue between right and left—they blame it all on the president, and yet really people like Ana Navarro and others on The View who shout and scream over everybody, really they’re adding to that poor dialogue. They’re setting a poor example for everyone with the sort of yelling and screaming, but the particular point we were trying to explain to her was the leaders in Venezuela are socialist. The leaders of their party identify as the socialist party. She was like, ‘No they’re thugs, they’re thugs. They’re not socialists.’ And I tried to calmly make the point to her that, well, they are socialists and they are thugs—and that’s precisely our point. When the government is controlled centrally by a few people, by one political party—the socialists—and you get central planning where you don’t have the freedom to decide what and how much to produce and consumers don’t get to choose, when a few people control things, you have much more of a susceptibility to kleptocracy, to thieves, to stealing and lying and enriching yourselves.”

Paul added that leftist anti-Trump personalities like Navarro “demean themselves” by opposing allowing “intelligent debate” on these issues.

“That’s what keeps happening [socialism failing] over and over again, and that’s what she doesn’t understand and so many on the left refuse to understand is that there is a tendency or maybe even something that is inherent to socialism that leads to thuggery,” Paul said. “People like her don’t want to see the lessons of Mao, the lessons of Stalin, the lessons of Hitler—they weren’t accidents of history, they were the natural conclusion of socialism. Maduro and Chávez are the natural conclusion to socialism. Then she was like, ‘Oh, President Trump is misusing this and saying that if the Democrats win you’ll get socialism.’ Then I said, and I don’t think she liked it, I said, ‘You know, if you vote for a socialist you might get socialism.’ And it’s like really? That sounds obvious to me. Bernie says he is a socialist—I think we’d get socialism [if he wins]. AOC says she’s a socialist. I would think we might socialism if these people ever get in charge of the government. So it’s sort of a bizarre situation, but they sort of demean themselves by being intolerant of allowing intelligent debate.”

While much of the interview focused on the issues of socialism and Sanders in particular, Paul added that the new Democrat frontrunner Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is really no different than Sanders when it comes to socialist ideology—just that she’s better at hiding it from the public than Sanders which is why she’s ascendant in the polls.

“I think there’s really not a dime’s worth of difference between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren,” Paul said. “They stand for the same policies and ultimately hers is a socialist platform also. You’re right, though, she’s like most liberals of the last several decades where they were always smart to try to hide their socialism from the public. And I think in the end, most of the major policies that have come out—Elizabeth Warren has rushed to support. So I don’t know that you can claim, maintain, or support that there’s much of a difference in policies between Bernie Sanders’ socialism and Elizabeth Warren.”

What’s particularly troubling, though, Paul said, is the evidence that socialism has won the day inside the Democrat Party as a whole. Ocasio-Cortez is now calling the shots and really running the House of Representatives now, not Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as evidenced by the Democrats’ lunging towards impeachment of President Trump. How the media and political class have gone after President Trump, versus the kid glove treatment of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, is exactly the kind of unfair double standard that Paul argues leads people to question the fairness of the political and economic system in America.

“I think they’re off the reservation now as far as impeachment goes,” Paul said. “[Pelosi] announced she was for it before she saw any transcripts of the phone call. And, the way I see it is I don’t think there’s anybody from either party who hasn’t threatened Ukraine’s aid and told them they have to investigate corruption. [Former Vice President Joe] Biden was there threatening it years ago, if they didn’t quit investigating his son’s company—the company that was paying him $50,000 a month—I think most Americans, when they hear that, just on the face of it, that some 30-year-old kid is on the board of an international company getting $50,000 a month, and his dad is traveling to Ukraine all the time, and his dad sort of tells them, ‘Guess what, you get no more money unless you fire this prosecutor.’ The prosecutor has actually now testified that he was investigating the company that was paying Hunter Biden. It just doesn’t pass the smell test. People are going to wonder and say, ‘Well, Pelosi is going to impeach the president over accusations he did something like this even though it doesn’t sound like he was willing to trade or do anything.’ But even if the accusations were accurate, they sound very similar to what Biden’s been accused of but yet nobody blinked an eye or accused Biden of doing something untoward that he should be impeached for. But I think the American people ultimately do want fairness, and they’re going to balk at treating Trump differently than Biden is treated. So if the American people perceive the actions of both to be similar, but that the Democrats are only willing to go after a Republican, I think it ends up becoming a partisan thing that I think people in the end are going to think was motivated by politics not by principle or justice.”

Paul added that this double standard is exactly why Americans on both sides of the aisle are “disturbed” by America’s political, financial, and cultural elites. He also explained that the ultimate irony of all this kleptocracy by the Bidens is that it has cleared the way for the rise of Warren, a socialist herself, and the question is whether she will be able to sufficiently hide her socialism.

“People get disturbed by it on both sides,” Paul said. “Really, they get disturbed by what’s going on. But, I think really that ultimately it’s going to be very, very hard and the irony is that while they thought this was going to bring Trump down, the irony is this is bringing Biden down. His numbers were already falling because he doesn’t seem to be on the ball as much as he used to, he doesn’t seem to have maybe what it takes to intellectually get through the questions of the day during the debates, and so I think that was already bringing him down but the association with the scandal and his son and all the money that went to his son, I think that’s what’s bringing him down. I agree with you that Elizabeth Warren is surging to the top, and the question will be: Will she run away from all the stuff she supports with Bernie, ultimately, or will the tag of socialism and the stain of socialism stick to her as well? We plan on being out there and talking about socialism over the next year and making the actual positions of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are well known and that the disaster of socialism is something our kids will hopefully know enough about to resist it.”

While he was vice president, Biden failed to stop his son Hunter Biden from cashing in on lucrative foreign business deals with Ukraine and China even as he was leading the Obama administration’s diplomatic efforts with the two countries.

President Donald Trump made it a focal point of his campaign, using Hunter Biden’s name in back-to-back rallies last week, ultimately forcing Hunter Biden to step down from his role in an investment company backed by China on Sunday.

Hunter Biden’s lawyers, however, were unclear whether he would keep his stake in the company — estimated at an investment worth millions.

But 2020 candidates are hesitant to swing at Biden, and some even appear defensive of the vice president on the issue of corruption.

The Biden campaign also fired a warning to his campaign rallies.

An aide to Biden told Bloomberg News any candidate who “calls themselves a ‘Democrat'” and repeats what the aide said were “discredited lies” about Biden and his son “would be making a profound statement about themselves.”

Sen. Warren at first stumbled by suggesting she did not approve of the idea of a vice president allowing to serve on the board of a foreign company.

“No. … I don’t know. I mean, I’d have to go back and look at the details,” she replied.

Since then, Warren dodged media attempts to answer questions about Biden and his son, pivoting back to accuse Trump of trying to dodge his own misconduct in Ukraine.

Sen. Bernie Sanders has also dodged the question, demanding “evidence” of any impropriety by the Bidens.

“I know I’m a little bit old-fashioned. I like to see the evidence before I talk about things. I read the papers and I read what I read,” Sanders said last week. “But I don’t know that I know enough at this point to make any definitive statement.”

Sen. Kamala Harris has also defended Biden, pointing instead at Trump.

“Mr. President, telling lies about Joe Biden won’t protect you from the truth. Joe has more patriotism in his pinky finger than you’ll ever have,” Harris wrote on Twitter.

Harris scored an early hit on Biden by questioning his history of opposing public bussing in public schools, even earning a bump in the polls, but the early momentum soon faded.

Attacking Biden has not worked well for other candidates as well. Former Housing Secretary Julian Castro swung at Biden, questioning memory loss in the last debate, but missed, earning scorn from pundits and Democrat voters.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand tried to score points against Biden on women’s issues, but her attack came off as self-serving, leading her to ultimately drop out of the race.

Other low-polling candidates who tried to score points against Joe Biden, such as New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio and Rep. Eric Swalwell, soon dropped out of the race after their attacks failed to resonate with primary voters.

Castro did not appear interested in hitting the Bidens again, responding to questions about Hunter Biden by criticizing Trump.

“Donald Trump is trying to use the same playbook against Joe Biden as he used against Hillary Clinton,” he said.

Mayor Pete Buttigeig began the week by vocally defending Biden on CNN, earning praise from the former Vice President.

“I’m a friend of Pete Buttigieg,” Biden told the United Food and Commercial Workers 2020 presidential forum on Sunday. “By the way, he’s a really decent guy. I turned on the television this morning and he was defending me and my family against these outrageous, lying ads of the president of the United States of America. That’s a good man.”

Sen. Cory Booker, who at times cannot resist taking gratuitous shots at Biden, has also stood up for the president.

“This is unacceptable, that if you come after Joe Biden, you’re going to have to deal with me in this case, these are baseless, unfounded, scurrilous lies,” he said in October.

But in September, Booker also questioned Hunter Biden’s actions when Trump’s attacks took form.

“I just don’t think children of vice presidents, presidents during the administration should be out there doing that,” he said.

Other candidates have promised not to allow similar behavior if they were elected president.

“I would not allow a family member, anyone in my cabinet to have a family member, to work in a position like that,” Rep. Beto O’Rourke said

Sen. Amy Klobachar promised the same.

“I can promise you right now, my own daughter, who’s only 24, does not sit on the board of a foreign company,” she said on CNN.

Andrew Yang said Hunter Biden’s role in foreign companies “certainly has a bad look to it.”

“In my mind they can wait until the term is over before serving that term,” he said. “And that’s really the way it would be under my administration.”

Tulsi Gabbard remains the wildcard.

After a devastating series of attacks against Sen. Kamala Harris in the August debate, Gabbard demonstrated she knew how to criticize the substance of her opponent’s record, without sounding gratuitous.

When asked to weigh in on the Biden’s she said that allowing a vice president’s son to sit on a corporate board “would be a poor decision to make.”

“I don’t know what went into that or how he got hired or why or what influence there was used, if any, but I think the perception is certainly a concern,” she said."

Janis: Her Life and Music, scheduled to be released Oct. 22, claims that a young Johnson ruthlessly hounded the future singer by making crude sexual remarks, throwing pennies at her, and making fun of her hippie style, according to an early look obtained by The Daily Mail.

Both attended Thomas Jefferson High School in Port Arthur, Texas, during the late 50s. While Johnson was a student athlete who socialized primarily with jocks and cheerleaders, Joplin was more introverted and tended toward the arts.

Johnson would grow up to become a college and NFL coach, serving as head coach for the Cowboys and seeing the team to two Super Bowl victories. He later became head coach for the Miami Dolphins. Johnson currently serves as a commentator for Fox NFL Sunday.

The new book by Holly George-Warren alleges that Johnson nicknamed Joplin “Beat Weeds” in a crude reference to her pubic hair, according to the Mail.

Johnson has admitted on Twitter that he gave her the nickname. He also said that he “kidded” Joplin a lot, and that she was an “odd duck” who wore black leotards.

“@joeirrera: high school classmate of Janis Joplin! Your followers would love some inside info on that.”I gave her Nickname ""Beat Weeds""! — Jimmy Johnson (@JimmyJohnson) April 29, 2012

“@Dustin_Mattison: Your classmate Janis Joplin is 69 today. How well did you know her?”fairly well..kidded her alot — Jimmy Johnson (@JimmyJohnson) January 19, 2012

“@danks231: what was Janis Joplin like in high school?”odd duck..weed..black leotards.. — Jimmy Johnson (@JimmyJohnson) November 26, 2011

The new book claims that Johnson also tried to grope Joplin, along with his friends, and spread rumors that the future singer had slept with their friends.

By Joplin’s senior year, she had become “the image of everything the students disliked,” according to the book.

Janis Joplin rose to fame as a counter-culture icon, performing rock, folk and blues songs to great acclaim. She died at 27 in 1970 of a heroin overdose.

In fact, it’s a point that was popularized by Republicans, including his one-time Senate opponent Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX).

Speaking at the CNN Democrat presidential debate today, Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke echoed a talking point often made by Republican critics of Silicon Valley — that big tech platforms ought to be considered publishers if they are engaged in curating content rather than taking a hands-off approach.

“Right now we treat [big tech platforms] functionally as a utility,” said Rep. O’Rourke, “when in reality they’re more akin to a publisher. They curate the content that we see.”

“Our pictures and personal information that they share with others … We would allow no publisher to do what Facebook is doing, to publish that ad that Senator Warren has rightfully called out, that CNN has refused to air because it is untrue and tells lies about the Vice President.”

“Treat them like the publisher[s] that they are, that is what I will do as President, and we will be unafraid to break up big businesses if we have to do that.”

Congressman O’Rourke is right. Big tech platforms, often due to pressure from his fellow Democrats to pick and choose what content their users see, have moved into the role of content curators and publishers as opposed to neutral platforms in recent years.

This change in policy was acknowledged by Google’s own internal researchers in a document exclusively leaked to Breitbart News called “The Good Censor.” In one section of the document, the researchers acknowledged that Google and other big tech platforms have tilted towards the role of “editor” and “publisher” in their approach to user-generated content.

Other leaks have revealed tech companies using top-down interventions to curate political search results (Google/YouTube), and putting high-profile political figures on a “hate agent” watchlist for potential banning (Facebook). Tech companies have also banned a wide range of political figures and news sources — ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, Facebook banned the pages of over 800 independent news websites.

Facebook has also acknowledged its status as a publisher in two separate court filings, one from November 2018 and one from September 2019.

It has long been the position of many leading Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) that actions like those listed above have made it more appropriate to describe them as publishers rather than neutral platforms.

“If they’re not going to be neutral public forums, if they’re going to be active political speakers, favoring one point of view and disfavoring another, they have a first amendment right to do that, but they have no entitlement to a special congressionally-created immunity from liability that nobody else enjoys,” Sen. Cruz told Breitbart News last year."

Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) wealth tax has failed in other western countries that have tried it.

Yang said he agreed with Warren that we are living in the most “winner-take-all economy in history.”

“And a wealth tax makes a lot of sense in principle,” Yang said. “The problem is it’s been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all those countries ended up repealing it because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they projected.”

“If we can’t learn from the failed experiences of other countries what can we learn from?” Yang said. “We should not be looking to other countries’ mistakes. Instead we should be looking at what Germany, France, Denmark and Sweden still have, which is a Value Added Tax.”

Then Yang suggested those taxes would come from American corporations and other businesses.

“If we give the American people a tiny slice of every Amazon sale, every Google search, every robot truck mile, every Facebook ad we can generate hundreds of billions of dollars and then put it into our hands because we know best how to use it,” Yang said.

National Review reported on the countries that have indeed repealed their wealth tax.

Wealth-tax supporters do not seem concerned about the likely damage to economic growth. But they should know that from a practical standpoint, wealth taxes in other countries have raised little money and have been a beast to administer. More than a dozen European countries used to have wealth taxes, but nearly all of these countries repealed them, including Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Sweden. Wealth taxes survive only in Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. Before repeal, European wealth taxes — with a variety of rates and bases — tended to raise only about 0.2 percent of gross domestic product in revenue, based on Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development data. That is only 1/40th as much as the U.S. federal income tax raises.

Leftist economist and political commentator Robert Reich tweeted about VAT after Yang’s remarks and how it would hurt lower income Americans.

Can we get this straight? A VAT — value added tax — is a sales tax on every stage of production. A sales tax is regressive. It takes a bigger bite from lower-income pay than from higher-income. A VAT is the most regressive system of all. — Robert Reich (@RBReich) October 16, 2019

Some 2020 Democrats have embraced the move to automatically specify preferred pronouns. During CNN’s Equality Town Hall this month, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) walked onto the stage and announced her preferred pronouns as “she, her, and hers.”

CNN’s Chris Cuomo issued an awkward response, which ultimately triggered backlash.

“‘She,’ ‘her,’ and ‘hers’? Mine, too,” he said, later apologizing for the remark:

PLEASE READ: When Sen. Harris said her pronouns were she her and her's, I said mine too. I should not have. I apologize. I am an ally of the LGBTQ community, and I am sorry because I am committed to helping us achieve equality. Thank you for watching our townhall. — Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) October 11, 2019

Like Harris, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has publicly specified her preferred pronouns, listing “She/her” on her Twitter bio:

Preferred pronouns have become a topic of interest among far-left millennials and social justice warriors, particularly. Those who identify as part of the ultra-progressive group argue that gender is a social construct and should be viewed as a spectrum, hence the varying genders and accompanying pronouns. Preferred pronouns can range from the traditional “his” or “hers” to lesser-known terms such as “xem,” “hirself,” “xyrs,” or “zir.”"

Other points on which the Democrats came together in peace and harmony:

— Trump should be impeached.

— Abortion is great.

— Obamacare sucks.

At least we’re all finally agreed on Obamacare!

Obamacare has given us a system — to quote Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont — “which is dysfunctional, which is cruel, 87 million uninsured, 30,000 people dying every single year, 500,000 people going bankrupt for one reason, they came down with cancer.”

None of the Democrats disagreed with Sanders’ description of health care in American today, although they have slightly different solutions.

I don’t mean to be rude, but I thought Obamacare was supposed to fix health care.

Millions of us were thrown off our health insurance plans by Obamacare, and now I find out that it didn’t even make things better for anyone else. The government intervenes, everything goes to hell, then Democrats cite the hell they created to demand another massive government intervention.

The motto of all socialist schemes should be: “This time, it will be different.”

The Democrats’ universal answer to the drug problem — which is actually a “Mexico Is on Our Border” problem — is to say they’d go after the pharmaceutical companies and then, in the next breath, demand that we legalize drugs.

In the midst of their crusading anger at the pharmaceutical companies, not one Democrat mentioned Purdue Pharma. You know — the primary culprit in the prescription drug epidemic, at least according to dozens of state attorneys general and hundreds of private lawsuits accusing the company of aggressively marketing OxyContin and hiding its addictive nature.

It would be like vowing to go after “middle-aged men” to stop underage sex trafficking on Orgy Island — but not mentioning Jeffrey Epstein.

The Democrats are furious with pharmaceutical companies, “wealthy corporations” (Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s phrase) and “the rich” (any guy with an alarm clock). But not with a specific multibillion-dollar company that makes OxyContin, and the kazillionaire family that owns it, the Sacklers.

Speaking of which, last year, Beverly Sackler, the recently deceased matriarch of the company, made political contributions to both Sen. Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.

Some poor medical researcher working to find a cure for cancer will have to pay — but the Sacklers get off scot-free.

Another big policy disagreement concerned guns, specifically: Do we allow people to turn in their guns voluntarily or should the government confiscate them?

As with liberals’ comical inability to tell an AK-47 from a semiautomatic, the gun facts flying around Tuesday night were not always well-researched. Beto O’Rourke said, “This is a country that loses 40,000 of our fellow Americans every year to gun violence.”

Wow. Not even close. According to the CDC, the number was less than 15,000 in 2017.

To liven things up, at one point, a smug Pete Buttigieg snapped at O’Rourke, “And I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.” This was in response to remarks not at all about Buttigieg’s courage. That’s gonna get old, fast.

Vice President Joe Biden bragged that he was “the only one on this stage who has taken on the NRA and beat them, and beat them twice. We were able to get assault weapons off the streets …”

Yes, and in direct response to that assault weapons ban opposed by the NRA, Republicans swept Congress in the very next election, winning control of the House for the first time in nearly half a century.

If you weren’t alive that glorious autumn evening in 1994, it was better than the November 2016 election. All night, there was breaking news, as one powerhouse Democrat after another lost his seat to a Republican. Every 15 minutes the GOP would set some new, jaw-dropping record. Thomas Foley, D-Wash., became the first speaker of the House to lose his election in 134 years. Republicans marched through the South like William Tecumseh Sherman, finishing off the “southern Democrats.” Tennessee went all red, with Republicans replacing the Democratic governor and two Democratic senators — including the Senate seat previously held by Vice President Al Gore. Not one Republican incumbent lost his seat.

Please, Joe, promise to “beat” the NRA again!

BUTTIGIEG: “No, this is really important, OK? On guns, we are this close to an assault weapons ban.”

This message was approved by Trump 2020."

But President Donald Trump’s staff used the Democrat debate to tout the rising blue-collar wages in his economy.

The questioners from CNN and the New York Times asked about trade, abortion, monopolies, the opioid epidemic, guns, and much else, but did not ask the candidates how they could change government policy to help raise Americans’ wages, which have been stalled since roughly 1990.

The candidates promised indirect government aid to Americans, such as “Medicare for All,” free college, and a rollback of pharmaceutical monopolies. Sen. Bernie Sanders promised a “jobs guarantee,” Andrew Yang touted his “freedom dividend” — which would be a $1,000 monthly check for each American adult — and Sen. Elizabeth Warren urged higher wages for childcare workers and pre-school teachers.

In contrast, Trump’s team emailed reporters a list of favorable media quotes admitting that his lower-immigration economy is helping to raise wages after decades of minimal growth. The email, which was sent mid-debate, was headlined: “Blue-collar workers are seeing big benefits from the Trump economy,” and it said:

America’s historic low unemployment rate of 3.5%, the lowest in fifty years, is unlocking opportunities for working class Americans.

From the Chicago Tribune: “What’s most heartening is that this jobs boom is helping the less-educated, low-skill Americans who’ve missed out on other, weaker jobs recoveries. Mark this moment: Millions of American job seekers have prayed for it.” Meanwhile, wage growth has exceeded 3% for eight out of nine months in 2019, and February’s wage growth of 3.4% was the strongest growth in a decade. Moreover, for the first time since 2009, the benefits of wage growth are predominantly going to “workers at the lower end of the pay scale.” From the New York Times: “The decade-long recovery is at last delivering income gains to middle-class and low-income families.”

From the Washington Post: “The surge of minority women getting jobs has helped push the U.S. workforce across a historic threshold. For the first time, most new hires of prime working age (25 to 54) are people of color.”

From the Economic Policy Institute: “From 2017 to 2018, relatively fast growth continued at the top…but the 20th and 30th percentiles saw the strongest growth at 4.8 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively.”

The Census Bureau said on September 10 that men who work full time and year-round got an average earnings boost of 3.4 percent in 2018, pushing their median salaries up to $55,291. Women gained 3.3 percent in wages, bringing their median salaries to $45,097 for full time, year-round work.

CNN and the New York Times also choose to ignore the decisive issue of 2016 — immigration, which has cut Americans’ wages amid a post-1990 flood of cheaper labor.

For example, income growth is lagging for American graduates, partly because the federal government allows investors to keep roughly 1.5 million college-graduate visa workers in good jobs sought by American graduates.

White House touts modest wage-gains in Trump's Buy/Hire American economy. Puzzle #1: Wage gains for college-grads lag behind gains for non-college employees. Puzzle #2: Why do white-collar journos not investigate slowdown to their college peers' salaries? https://t.co/TYy7deCWQ8 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) August 15, 2019

Immigration Numbers:

Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or a university. This total includes about 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled degrees in business or health care, engineering or science, software, or statistics.

But the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants and refreshes a resident population of about 1.5 million white-collar visa workers — including approximately one million H-1B workers and spouses — and about 500,000 blue-collar visa workers. The government also prints more than one million work permits for new foreigners and rarely punishes companies for employing illegal migrants.

This policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth and stock values for investors. The stimulus happens because the extra labor ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions.

The federal policy of flooding the market with cheap, foreign white-collar graduates and blue-collar labor shifts wealth from young employees toward older investors. It also widens wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, reduces marriage rates, and hurts children’s schools and college educations.

The cheap-labor economic strategy also pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and it sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with drug addictions.

The labor policy also moves business investment and wealth from the Heartland to the coastal cities, explodes rents and housing costs, undermines suburbia, shrivels real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech, labor-intensive workplaces."

CNN and the New York Times opened the debate with a discussion on the partisan-based impeachment inquiry.

“Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support,” Anderson Cooper, one of the debate’s moderators, said.

“Sen. Warren, I want to start with you,” Cooper continued.

“You have said that there’s already enough evidence for President Trump to be impeached and removed from office. But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate?” he asked.

The Massachusetts senator said impeachment is necessary because the president broke the law “over and over.” She said she initially made the determination after reading the Mueller report and falsely claimed that Mueller had shown “that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly,” despite the fact that Mueller made no such determination.

Attorney General William Barr determined that Trump did not obstruct justice, explaining that the evidence was “not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense.”

“Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences,” Warren said, adding that impeachment is about Trump as well as “the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country.”

“The impeachment must go forward,” she proclaimed.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) concurred, repeating the false claim that Trump obstructed justice and calling him the “most corrupt president in the history of this country.”

“I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment because of the emoluments clause. This is a president who is enriching himself while using the Oval Office to do that, and that is outrageous,” he said, adding that he looks forward to a “speedy and expeditious impeachment process.”

“Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate,” he added.

While there are varying degrees of support, all of Warren and Sanders’ colleagues signaled support for the Democrat-led impeachment efforts.

Here are their most significant lines on impeachment:

Joe Biden (D):

I said from the beginning that if, in fact, Trump continued to stonewall what the Congress is entitled to know about his background, what he did, all the accusations in the Mueller report, if they did that, they would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information. This president — and I agree with Bernie, Sen. Sanders — is the most corrupt president in modern history and I think all of our history. And the fact is that this president of the United States has gone so far as to say, since this latest event, that, in fact, he will not cooperate in any way at all, will not list any witnesses, will not provide any information, will not do anything to cooperate with the impeachment. They have no choice but to move.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA):

But the reality of it is that I don’t really think this impeachment process is going to take very long, because as a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it. And he did it in plain sight. He has given us the evidence. And he tried to cover it up, putting it in that special server. And there’s been a clear consciousness of guilt. This will not take very long. Donald Trump needs to be held accountable. He is, indeed, the most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had.

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ):

Anybody who has criticisms about a process that is making all the facts bare before the American public, that works to build consensus, that’s what this nation needs, in what is a moral moment and not a political one. So I swore an oath to do my job as a senator, do my duty. This president has violated his. I will do mine.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN):

We can do two things at once. That’s our job. We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment, but we also can stand up for America, because this president has not been putting America in front of his own personal interests.

Julián Castro (D):

Not only that, what we have to recognize is that not only did the Mueller report point out ten different instances where the president obstructed justice or tried to, and he made that call to President Zelensky of the Ukraine, but he is in ongoingly — in an ongoing way violating his oath of office and abusing his power. We have to impeach this president. And the majority of Americans not only support impeachment, they support removal. He should be removed.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D):

Look, the president has left the Congress with no choice. And this is not just about holding the president accountable, for not just the things emerging in these investigations, but actions that he has confessed to on television. It’s also about the presidency itself, because a president ten years or 100 years from now will look back at this moment and draw the conclusion either that no one is above the law or that a president can get away with anything.

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI):

The serious issues that have been raised around this phone call that he had with the president of Ukraine and many other things that transpired around that are what caused me to support the inquiry in the House. And I think that it should continue to play its course out, to gather all the information, provide that to the American people, recognizing that that is the only way forward. If the House votes to impeach, the Senate does not vote to remove Donald Trump, he walks out and he feels exonerated, further deepening the divides in this country that we cannot afford.

Tom Steyer (D):

Two years ago, I started the Need to Impeach movement, because I knew there was something desperately wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, that we did have the most corrupt president in the country, and that only the voice and the will of the American people would drag Washington to see it as a matter of right and wrong, not of political expediency. So, in fact, impeaching and removing this president is something that the American people are demanding. They’re the voice that counts, and that’s who I went to, the American people.

Andrew Yang (D):

I support impeachment, but we shouldn’t have any illusions that impeaching Donald Trump will, one, be successful or, two, erase the problems that got him elected in 2016.

Beto O’Rourke (D):

And we have a responsibility to be fearless in the face of this president’s criminality and his lawlessness. The fact that as a candidate for the highest office in the land, he invited the participation, the invasion of a foreign power in our democracy. As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the FBI, tried to fire Mueller, head of the investigation, then invited President Zelensky to involve himself in our politics, as well as China, in exchange for favorable trade terms in an upcoming trade deal.

Trump reacted to the Democrat debate on Wednesday, writing, “You would think there is NO WAY that any of the Democrat Candidates that we witnessed last night could possibly become President of the United States.”

“Now you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal & absurd Impeachment of one of the most successful Presidents!” he exclaimed:

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced on Tuesday that the House will hold off on a House-wide vote on the impeachment inquiry.

“There’s no requirement that we have a vote, and at this time, we will not have a vote,” Pelosi said at a press conference on Tuesday.

“We’re not here to call bluffs. We’re here to find the truth, to uphold the Constitution of the United States,” she added. “This is not a game for us, this is deadly serious.”"

Little clarity could be found on the subject during Tuesday night’s Democrat presidential debate , during which the candidates energetically criticized President Donald Trump, but grew vague and evasive when asked to describe the situation in Syria or explain how they would handle it.

Former Vice President Joe Biden boasted about how much time he spent in the White House on foreign policy and Syria for a while, then seemingly threatened to declare war on Turkey, something neither he nor any other Democrat would actually do if they became president:

I would not have withdrawn the troops and I would not have withdrawn the additional thousand troops who are in Iraq, which are in retreat now, being fired on by Assad’s people. And the president of the United States saying, if those ISIS folks escape from the prisons they’re in, they’ll only go to Europe and won’t affect us. It has been the most shameful thing that any president has done in modern history — excuse me, in terms of foreign policy. And the fact of the matter is, I’ve never seen a time — and I’ve spent thousands of hours in the Situation Room, I’ve spent many hours on the ground in those very places, in Syria and in Iraq, and guess what? Our commanders across the board, former and present, are ashamed of what’s happening here. What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where he’s going to have a problem — because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real lockdown conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done now. Pay that price.

Note that there is no evidence of the Syrian army firing at American troops, but Biden might have been confusing Syrian with Turkish forces, which have reportedly fired uncomfortably close to American positions in Iraq.

A real journalist would have pointed out to Biden that some of the Syrian groups his administration told us were reliable “white hat” military allies have joined the Turks to attack the Kurds and asked how he failed to discern the true nature of those groups during the “thousands of hours” he boasted of spending in the White House Situation Room, but fortunately for Biden, CNN does not employ anyone who would ask a question like that of a Democrat.

The only candidate who did not try to stuff herself into a war hawk costume at the debate was Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), who got to speak next, and challenged both Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Mayor Pete Buttigieg on their positions.

Gabbard has her own issues when it comes to Syria — which she attempted to deal with by denying that she has been a “Russian asset” or “Assad apologist” — and she professed to have qualms about President Trump’s sudden pullout from the Turkish border region, but she described the Turkish attack on the Kurds as “yet another negative consequence of the regime change war we’ve been waging in Syria,” a war the media was “championing and cheerleading” throughout the Obama administration.

Gabbard said she would take two steps on Syria: ending sanctions against the Assad regime “that are really a modern-day siege, the likes of which we are seeing Saudi Arabia wage against Yemen, that have caused tens of thousands of Syrian civilians to die and to starve,” and ending U.S. support for Syrian rebel forces, some of which are linked to terrorist groups like al-Qaeda. Neither of those steps would ameliorate Turkey’s concerns in any way or persuade it to halt its invasion of Syria.

Gabbard taunted Warren about living up to the anti-war stance she took so ostentatiously during the second Bush administration. Warren, boxed into a corner, had nothing meaningful to say beyond vague platitudes about getting out of the Middle East “the smart way” and complaints about Trump helping ISIS “get another foothold, a new lease on life.”

“I sit on the Armed Services Committee. I talk with our military leaders about this. I was in Iraq and went through the neighborhoods that ISIS destroyed. We need to get out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no military solution in this region,” Warren said.

Turkey certainly seems to think there is a “military solution” to its security concerns, having worked for years to obtain a “negotiated solution” without satisfactory results. Russia and Iran somehow found a “military solution” to the Syrian civil war.

CNN moved very quickly along to Buttigieg, who was allowed to simultaneously claim he opposes “endless wars” but also call for an endless American presence in the worst quagmire on the planet.

Buttigieg, a military veteran, abandoned years of Democrat Party dogma about Afghanistan being the “good war” to argue that Syria is the only place American troops should be stationed.

“Look, I didn’t think we should have gone to Iraq in the first place. I think we need to get out of Afghanistan. But it’s also the case that a small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we’re seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS,” he said.

Buttigieg claimed pulling out of Syria would be “taking away what makes America America” and would make “the world a more dangerous place,” which oddly enough is exactly the opposite of what Democrats said when they urged a pullout from Iraq. They used to get very angry at people who implied their criticism of the Iraq deployment would be “taking away what makes America America.” They routinely portrayed American soldiers in Iraq as helpless victims of the insurgency whose lives were being squandered.

Gabbard jumped in and called Buttigieg out on his claim to oppose endless wars while “continuing to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an indefinite period of time to continue this regime change war,” a policy that involves “providing arms in support to terrorist groups in Syria, like al-Qaeda, HTS, al-Nusra and others.”

Buttigieg never answered her question. Instead, he claimed he would not be able to look Afghan civilians or soldiers in the eye after Trump’s pullout from Syria, which is funny because not three minutes earlier he said he wanted to pull out from Afghanistan.

Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) refused to say whether he would support kicking Turkey out of NATO but insisted Turkey should no longer be seen as a U.S. ally “when they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter.” Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) evaded the same question about NATO membership, condemning Turkey’s actions as “outrageous” and a “horror” but advising continued engagement and negotiations with Turkey.

Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) said Trump endangered U.S. national security by “basically giving 10,000 ISIS fighters a get-out-of-jail-free card” and making the Islamic State one of the “big winners” in Syria, in addition to Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime. It appears to have escaped her notice that the latter three were already the “big winners” in Syria before Trump’s election, even though she boasted of sitting on the Senate Intelligence Committee, where such things are presumably discussed.

Biden came back to wrap up the Syria section of the debate with a characteristically disjointed rant about how Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan “understands if he’s out of NATO, he’s in real trouble,” but also efforts to break up NATO are the demonic work of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“And with regard to regime change in Syria, that has not been the policy we change the regime. It has been to make sure that the regime did not wipe out hundreds of thousands of innocent people between there and the Iraqi border,” Biden insisted, forgetting that President Obama explicitly stated Assad had to go, and a very large number of innocent people were indeed “wiped out” or driven out of Syria on his and Obama’s watch.

Biden’s rambling closer typifies the problem the Democrats face on Syria: All of them, with the exception of no-hope candidate Tulsi Gabbard, want to virtue-signal as loud as they can and slam President Trump as hard as possible, but none of them wants to discuss the details of what has been happening in Syria since 2011 or propose a cogent strategy for changing conditions on the ground in a meaningful way. None of them talked about an “exit strategy,” a phrase they were very big on during the Iraq operation.

None of the Democrats wanted to discuss Turkey’s claims of a severe security threat from northeastern Syria, discuss why the international community did nothing to address those claims, or explain why the United States was held solely responsible for preventing Turkey from taking action. They treated the notion of Russian and Syrian involvement against the Turkish assault as inherently outrageous without explaining why the Syrian government should not be held responsible for protecting its own citizens and securing its own borders. They complained about escaping ISIS prisoners without discussing why thousands of them were still parked in Kurdish prison camps and how long they should be left there.

None of the Democrats was asked to present a war plan for fighting Turkey or discuss how much the U.S. depends on Turkish bases for operations in the Middle East. None of them, not even Biden, was pressed on how the Obama administration set the table for current events. None of them acknowledged the difficulty of getting reliable information from any party involved in the savage Syrian civil war, although Gabbard came close when she pointed out how dodgy some of the groups supported by the Obama administration were.

And of course, CNN would not dream of asking the Democrat candidates — several of whom are sitting senators — why their caucus did not authorize military force against Turkey to protect the Kurds, instead spending all of its time on an impeachment crusade against President Trump. Trump said he wanted to pull troops out of Syria almost a year ago, and Erdogan was threatening to invade long before that. The Democrats had plenty of time to pass the appropriate congressional resolutions and send a strong message to Turkey, but that would have involved putting real political capital on the line instead of sniping from the sidelines."

Maddie McGarvey for CNN Twelve presidential candidates take part in the Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio, on Tuesday, October 15. The candidates, from left, are US Rep.

Amy Klobuchar; and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro.

It was the most crowded debate stage in the history of US presidential primaries.

Twelve candidates shared the spotlight Tuesday at the Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus. The event was hosted by CNN and The New York Times on the campus of Otterbein University.

This was the fourth Democratic debate of the campaign season, and it came three and a half months before the Iowa caucuses.

The first two debates had so many candidates that they had to be split up over two nights. But the Democratic National Committee raised the polling and fundraising thresholds that candidates need to qualify.

Those thresholds will be raised once again ahead of next month's debate in Georgia, so Tuesday might have been a make-or-break night for some of the lower-polling candidates."

He cautioned ahead of Tuesday evening’s debate that Democrat candidates need to tell voters how they will practically implement their lofty policy proposals.

Bloomberg wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post urging Democrat candidates to explain how they would make their grandiose proposals a reality.

The former mayor said it is likely the next president will face a “closely divided Congress.” Because of that, candidates need to explain how they would implement their ideas – such as Medicare for All and their multi-trillion-dollar Green New Deal proposals.

“Rarely are the candidates asked, and more rarely still do they talk about, how they would go about achieving their goals,” Bloomberg wrote.

“The fact is: A legislative proposal is only as good as the execution plan that accompanies it. And even the best plans must be flexible enough to accommodate necessary changes, to prevent the perfect from being the enemy of the good,” he continued.

He added:

The presidential aspirants are not short on big ideas. But voters must demand they explain how they intend to move from proposing plans to actually implementing them, including passing them through Congress. Those who dodge the question by speaking of revolution and the bully pulpit aren’t up to the job.

The op-ed follows reports of Bloomberg’s rumored reconsideration of a presidential bid. While he announced his intention of staying out of the presidential race due to the “difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field” in March, Biden’s slow and steady fall has the former mayor rethinking his decision.

Bloomberg has told associates that he is considering throwing his hat in the presidential ring of Biden drops out.

“Bloomberg is in if Biden is out,” a source, described as a “New York billionaire with ties to Bloomberg,” told CNBC.

As CNBC reported:

Bloomberg has signaled he’s “still looking at” running for president, but people close him say that the only way he could even go down that path is if Biden’s fortunes suffer so much that he drops out before or during the early stages of the primary. Bloomberg could then enter the race as one of the rare moderates with enough name recognition and campaign funding to make a run. Forbes estimates his net worth at $51 billion, and he was planning to spend over $100 million on a campaign for president if he ran.

While Biden has not signaled any intention to drop out of the race, his lackluster debate performance is not expected to elevate his position in the polls. The former vice president failed to have a breakout moment during the three-hour debate and experienced at least seven gaffes, mistakenly pronouncing exponentially as “expodentially,” mentioning Roe. v Wade before correcting himself to the subject of gun sales, and claiming that people are “clipping coupons in the stock market” during a discussion on the economy:

If Bloomberg does, in fact, jump into the presidential ring in coming months, he would likely face questions surrounding his recent praise of China– particularly that Chinese Communist Party chairman Xi Jinping is “not a dictator”:

(CNN) Within the first 10 minutes of Tuesday's fourth presidential debate, you could tell something fundamental had changed in the race: Elizabeth Warren is the new front-runner.

The Massachusetts senator was attacked from all sides from the get-go -- on how she planned to fund her ""Medicare for All"" plan, on the ""punitive"" nature of her policy solutions, and on her supposed claims to be the only one in the field who had bold ideas.

By our count, at least seven other candidates on the stage attacked Warren at some point during the three-hour debate. That dynamic ensured that the fourth debate wouldn't be as successful for Warren as the previous three -- no one can take that amount of incoming and emerge unscathed -- but also proved, very clearly, that no matter what the polls show, her rivals believe her to be the one to beat in this race.

We've reflected that changed reality in our latest 2020 rankings. Below, the 10 men and women with the best chance of emerging as the Democratic nominee in 2020.

The businessman managed to qualify for the debate by buying a lot of ads in the early primary states to boost his poll numbers.

510,"Eric Bradner, Dan Merica and Gregory Krieg, CNN",,"Polls show that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is now a front-runner for the 2020 Democratic nomination. And on Tuesday night in Ohio, her 11 rivals acted like it.",2019-10-16,CNN,7 takeaways from the debate,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/16/politics/october-democratic-debate-highlights/index.html,"Westerville, Ohio (CNN) Polls show that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is now a front-runner for the 2020 Democratic nomination . And on Tuesday night in Ohio, her 11 rivals acted like it.

The party's fourth presidential debate , hosted by CNN and The New York Times, showcased the shifting dynamics of the Democratic primary. Warren was under attack all night -- though it's far from clear whether anyone dented her status at the top of the field. Former Vice President Joe Biden , the other front-runner, stayed out of the fray for much of the event -- until a late clash with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders that featured the same one-on-one, progressive-against-moderate battle that defined the 2016 Democratic contest.

And moderate candidates -- some, like South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, fighting to climb into the top tier; others, like Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, just desperate to make the next debate stage -- dropped the euphemisms and pressed their progressive foes in direct and sometimes personal terms.

Here are seven takeaways from Tuesday night's debate:

Warren under attack for the first time

JUST WATCHED Warren attacked from all sides on the debate stage Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Warren attacked from all sides on the debate stage 02:42

Warren's months-long march to the front of the polls finally put her in the position of being the most heavily targeted and scrutinized candidate on stage.

Buttigieg and Klobuchar led the charge, assailing Warren over her answers on health care.

Warren supports Sanders' proposal for ""Medicare for All"" -- replacing private insurance with everyone receiving coverage through a government-run plan. And while Sanders has acknowledged that Americans' taxes would need to increase to pay for the plan, Warren refused to say whether the middle class's taxes would go up -- instead only saying that, because deductibles, premiums and co-pays would be eliminated, overall costs would decrease.

Buttigieg accused her of dodging a yes-or-no question. ""Your signature is to have a plan for everything, except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this plan that Sen. Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in,"" he said.

Klobuchar accused Warren of being dishonest. ""We owe it to the American people to tell them where we will send the invoice,"" she said.

Warren later addressed the question of taxes, when former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke asked her -- during a discussion about Warren's proposed wealth tax and child care coverage -- whether she would raise middle-class taxes. ""No,"" she said -- but the moment was mostly lost amid cross-talk.

Bernie Sanders won the night

And it had nothing to do with what happened on stage.

In the debate's final moments, the Washington Post broke the news that New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez plans to endorse Sanders. CNN then reported that two other members of the ""Squad,"" Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, will do the same.

The pick-ups are huge. Some Democratic strategists think that outside of the Obamas, Ocasio-Cortez represents the most influential potential endorsement of the 2020 primary race.

It also comes at a key moment for Sanders. Warren's months-long ascent, fueled in part by progressives as she advocated some similar policies to Sanders, was on display Tuesday night, when the rest of the field treated her as the front-runner. If Ocasio-Cortez had supported her, it could have been the beginning of the end of Sanders' chances.

Instead, he gets a major injection of energy -- and sends the signal that he's far from done yet.

Echoes of 2016 as the front-runners fight

JUST WATCHED Warren takes a jab at Biden while complimenting Obama Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Warren takes a jab at Biden while complimenting Obama 01:41

For most of the night, as Warren wore the biggest target, Biden slipped into the background. That changed near the end of the debate, when the field's top tier -- Biden, Warren and Sanders -- finally unloaded on each other.

The question that loomed over their: Biden has a lengthy record -- but is it one that's in line with where the Democratic electorate is now?

It began when Biden touted his record in former President Barack Obama's administration, pressuring Republicans to vote for measures such as the federal stimulus package.

""We all have good ideas. The question is who is going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done?"" Biden said. ""And I'm not suggesting they can't, but I'm suggesting that's what we should look at.""

That's when Sanders pounced, attacking Biden -- in a moment that felt similar to the Vermont senator's 2016 debates with Hillary Clinton -- over legislation Biden had supported and Sanders opposed over the last three decades.

""Joe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what, you also got done, and I say this as a good friend,"" Sanders said. ""You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle class families all over this country. You got trade agreements like NAFTA and (trade relations) with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs.""

Then Warren jumped in.

Responding to Biden's assertion that he is best able to get things done, she pointed to her role in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Obama administration.

Seemingly miffed to be denied a share of the credit, Biden interjected, nearly shouting, ""I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it, so let's get those things straight, too.""

Warren responded by thanking Obama -- but notably omitting Biden.

""I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law,"" she said.

Trouble for Biden?

For the former vice president, fading into the background of a debate is a troubling sign because of what it suggests: that his foes view him as less of a threat than they once did.

But just as the good news had come late for Sanders, the real bad news for Biden's campaign came even later Wednesday night.

In a scheduling oddity, reports covering the third quarter of 2019 were due in to the Federal Election Commission by midnight -- an hour after the debate ended.

Biden's report revealed that his campaign ended September with just $9 million on hand. That's far short of Sanders' $33.7 million, Warren's $25.7 million and Buttigieg's $23.4 million -- and is even below California Sen. Kamala Harris' $10.5 million.

A more aggressive Buttigieg

JUST WATCHED Buttigieg to O'Rourke: I don't need lessons from you Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Buttigieg to O'Rourke: I don't need lessons from you 03:29

The South Bend, Indiana, mayor had made it obvious he planned to come out swinging. In the days before the debate, he'd launched an ad that was critical of Warren and Sanders over Medicare for All, criticized Warren's grassroots fundraising strategy for the general election as being reliant on ""pocket change,"" and attacked O'Rourke over his support for mandatory buy-backs of assault-style rifles in an interview on Snapchat's ""Good Luck America.""

The exchanges with Warren over health care might be the night's most memorable.

But he also got a chance to tout an element of his own biography -- his military service -- in clashing with Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, the only other military veteran in the field, over her call to end ""endless wars.""

""The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this President of American allies and American values,"" he said.

Buttigieg also sharply criticized O'Rourke -- at one point, in personal terms -- over the former Texas congressman's proposed mandatory buy-backs of assault-style rifles.

""You just made it clear that you don't know how this is going to take weapons off the street,"" he said. ""If you can develop the plan further, we can have a debate. But we can't wait.""

O'Rourke responded that mass shootings are a ""crisis"" and that Democrats should make the case for farther-reaching gun control measures. ""Let's decide what we are going to believe in, what we are going to achieve, and let's bring this country together in order to do that,"" he said.

Buttigieg shot back: ""The problem isn't the polls, the problem is the policy. And I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.""

""I don't care what that meant to me or my candidacy,"" O'Rourke replied. But to survivors of gun violence, and March For Our Lives, the gun control advocacy group founded by students after the Parkland, Florida, shooting last year, ""that was a slap in the face to every single one of those groups,"" he said. Moments later, the organization tweeted praise for O'Rourke's position.

Klobuchar, unleashed

With the Democratic National Committee raising its fundraising and polling thresholds for the November debate, Klobuchar walked on stage facing the real possibility that this debate could be her last.

Her response: Go hard at the Democratic primary's most ascendant candidate, Warren.

""The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done,"" she said of Warren at one point, as she criticized her support for Medicare for All.

Klobuchar's performance on Tuesday stands in stark contrast to her first three debate performances, which were more muted.

And there is a reason for that: After qualifying for the first four debates, Klobuchar is on the verge of not qualifying for the fifth Democratic debate in November. While Klobuchar has the required number of donors, she has yet to reach the polling threshold, something that her team believes she can boost with a well-reviewed debate.

Then there's the portion of her approach that's in the eye of the beholder: One of her trademarks as a candidate -- goofy humor -- continued on Tuesday night.

""Vladimir Putin is someone who has shot down planes over Ukraine, who has poisoned his opponent and we have not talked about what we need to do to protect ourselves from Russia invading our election,"" Klobuchar said. ""This wasn't meddling. That's what I do when I call my daughter on a Saturday night and ask her what she's doing.""

Yang's 'Freedom Dividend' gets an airing

Andrew Yang launched his presidential campaign in 2017 with a plan to give every American $1,000 a month to combat job losses and automation -- and very little attention from media and voters.

Almost two years later, Yang's plan for a universal basic income, which he's calling a ""freedom dividend,"" remains his signature policy proposal. But his impact on the race has increased dramatically -- a reality that was on display on Tuesday night when the candidates on stage debated a universal basic income and job losses to automation in depth on national television.

""We have a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month, it recognizes the work in our families and communities. It helps all Americans transition,"" Yang said. ""When we put the money into our hands, we can build a trickle up economy from our people, our families and our communities up. It will enable us to do the work that we want to do. This is the sort of vision in response to the fourth industrial revolution that we have to embrace.""

Yang has talked about his universal basic income at previous debates. What made Tuesday different was that other candidates -- some of whom largely ignored Yang in previous debates -- began to seriously debate automation and a basic income.

""I believe that we need to address a community being impacted by automation,"" said former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro.

""I agree with my friend Andrew Yang. Universal basic income is a good idea to help provide that security so people can make choices that they want to see,"" Gabbard said.

But what clearly cemented Yang's rise is that the debate over universal basic income got him into a direct argument with Warren, who said the issue is broader.

After the debate, Yang told CNN that Warren -- who, with Biden, is at the top of the Democratic field -- had asked him to send her details on his proposal. ""She said she wanted to see the data,"" he said."

Elizabeth Warren, said Wednesday his 2020 rival has been ""more specific and forthcoming about the number of selfies she's taken"" than about laying out details of how she'd pay for ""Medicare for All.""

""Not only is it important to have 'yes-or-no' answers to 'yes-or-no' questions at a time when people are so frustrated with Washington speak, but also there's still been no explanation for a multitrillion-dollar hole in this plan,"" the South Bend, Indiana, mayor told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""I have a lot of respect for Senator Warren, but last night she was more specific and forthcoming about the number of selfies she's taken than about how this plan is going to be funded. And that's a real problem, especially when there's a better way to deliver health care coverage to everybody.""

Buttigieg was among several Democratic presidential candidates who took aim at Warren during the fourth Democratic primary debate hosted CNN and The New York Times on Tuesday night. He has criticized Warren over her support for Medicare for All and criticized her again during the debate for not directly answering a ""yes-or-no"" question on how she would fund such a proposal.

Warren supports Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' proposed plan, which would create a national government-run health care program and eliminate the private insurance industry -- something several candidates criticized during the debate.

Buttigieg, who has fashioned himself as a centrist candidate as the Democratic Party has veered leftward, was among the Democrats onstage Tuesday night who challenged Warren, who has emerged as a front-runner in the 2020 field. The Massachusetts senator was constantly on defense throughout the debate, underscoring a marked shift in the Democratic race that has been underway for many weeks: while former Vice President Joe Biden has remained strong in the polls, the other candidates in the race clearly now see Warren as the real competition.

Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group",Elizabeth Warren doesn't just pose a threat to Wall Street. Her rising 2020 polling numbers are also striking fear in the heart of Big Oil.,2019-10-17,CNN,How Elizabeth Warren could 'vaporize' America's oil boom,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/17/business/elizabeth-warren-oil-fracking-ban/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Elizabeth Warren doesn't just pose a threat to Wall Street. Her rising 2020 polling numbers are also striking fear in the heart of Big Oil.

Warren, currently the odds-on favorite to be the Democratic presidential nominee, wants to ban fracking ""everywhere."" And the Massachusetts senator pledged to immediately sign an executive order to stop all new offshore drilling leases. Both steps go further than her main rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.

It would be wildly bullish for crude oil prices. We'd be heading back to triple-digit prices very fast.""

Warren's aggressive plan for fighting the climate crisis could have profound consequences for the oil and gas industry. Although an outright fracking ban seems unlikely to get through Congress and the courts, such a move would halt America's historic shale oil boom in its tracks, drive up gasoline prices, threaten good-paying jobs and make the nation more dependent on foreign oil.

""It would vaporize the oil and gas boom in the United States,"" said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, a consulting firm that advises energy companies and investors. ""There is palpable concern in the oil and gas industry.""

Wall Street analysts are already warning shareholders about the potential hit to the share prices of oil companies, which remain widely held in portfolios despite the climate crisis.

Pioneer Natural Resources PXD ExxonMobil XOM Chevron CVX ""We think the greatest risk to energy companies would occur if Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren wins,"" RBC Capital Markets wrote in a report published on Monday. The firm said it would be ""very bearish"" for a wide range of oil companies, including drillers such as, oilfield service firms and even integrated companies likeand

Warren's campaign declined to comment. But the candidate has defended her aggressive stance by arguing the world doesn't have the luxury of playing it safe.

""Taking bold action to confront the climate crisis is as important — and as urgent — as anything else the next president will face. We cannot wait,"" Warren wrote in a Medium post last month.

The best-case scenario for the oil industry could be the reelection of President Donald Trump, a climate skeptic who has actively supported the fossil fuel industry by slashing environmental regulations and promoting energy exports.

Democrats have taken a much more skeptical approach towards Big Oil than Trump as they pledge to tackle climate change. The leading candidates have called for ending fossil fuel subsidies

Besides Warren, Democratic presidential nominees Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker have also pushed to ban fracking , the controversial drilling technique that involves shooting water, sand and other compounds underground to release trapped oil and gas. Fracking has sparked concerns of contaminated drinking water, methane emissions and even earthquakes.

That's why environmental groups strongly support a fracking ban.

""A clean energy economy built to tackle the climate crisis cannot include fracked gas, which is a bridge to climate disaster,"" Ariel Hayes, national political director at the Sierra Club, said in a statement to CNN Business.

'Wildly bullish' for oil prices

Fracking, which gained popularity in the early 2000s, has made the United States the world's leading producer of natural gas and, more recently, the top oil producer . In 2016, fracking accounted for more than two-thirds of all oil and natural gas wells drilled in the United States, according to the Energy Information Administration

Driven by the shale revolution, US oil production has more than doubled over the past decade to about 12 million barrels per day. That surge of oil has cushioned the blow from recent events, including oil barrels sidelined by the attack on Saudi Aramco and US sanctions on Iran and Venezuela.

An outright fracking ban would probably send crude oil prices soaring because the United States produces more oil than any other country on the planet. The world is relying on US oil shale oil as the main source of growth for the next several years.

""It would be wildly bullish for crude oil prices. We'd be heading back to triple-digit prices very fast,"" said McNally, a former energy official under President George W. Bush.

Oil jobs at risk

But it wouldn't be bullish for the oil industry. That's because the fracking ban would probably cause highly leveraged US shale oil producers to go bankrupt, or at least have limited financial firepower to take advantage of high prices.

""They will have been regulated out of business,"" McNally said. ""And the US oil companies that remain will get blamed for high oil prices.""

A fracking ban could wipe out countless good-paying jobs in the oil and gas industry.

""You'd have layoffs, everything from the field hands up to the C-Suite,"" said Jeff Bush, president of oil and gas recruiting firm CSI Recruiting.

A 2017 study paid for by the American Petroleum Institute found that a fracking ban would cause the loss of nearly 6 million jobs and lift household energy spending by $4,500 a year.

Warren has pledged to create new jobs to help workers who are hurt by the transition to a greener economy.

Senator Elizabeth Warren has pledged to immediately put a stop to new fossil fuel leases for drilling offshore and on public lands.

""We will no longer force workers to make the impossible choice between fossil fuel industry jobs with superior wages and benefits and green economy jobs that pay far less,"" Warren wrote in the Medium post.

A fracking ban might not have a large impact on prices if oil demand weakened because of a rapid shift towards electric vehicles

However, most forecasters expect the world's appetite for oil will rise for many years, if not decades. And even Warren's own energy plan doesn't call for 100% zero emissions for new vehicles until 2030.

That means diminished domestic oil production would likely make America more dependent on foreign crude, undoing its strides toward energy independence.

""It's not going to reduce consumption,"" said Bush. ""It just means we'd be buying more oil from overseas. I don't think anybody wants that.""

An outright fracking ban also would require an act of Congress, according to analysts.

Such legislation would be unlikely to get through Congress because Republicans are widely expected to maintain control of the Senate. Even if the Senate flipped, moderate Democrats in oil-producing states such as Colorado and New Mexico would face pressure to oppose such a ban.

""There is no real clean path towards a fracking ban,"" said Josh Price, senior analyst at Height Capital Markets. ""It seems completely unrealistic, close to impossible.""

Federal drilling ban could slow oil boom

Still, Warren could take regulatory and executive actions aimed at discouraging fracking.

For instance, RBC said Warren would probably be able to ban fracking and all output on federal lands. Oil output on federal lands is about 2.7 million barrels per day, or 22% of total output.

If such a ban took effect in early 2021, it would slash US oil production by about 300,000 barrels per day that year, RBC said. And by 2025, the firm's US oil production forecast would decline by 1.2 million barrels per day.

The loss of US barrels would drive global oil prices $5 to $10 higher, lifting gasoline prices by 10 cents to 25 cents a gallon, according to RBC. And federal oil and gas revenue would tumble by up to $20 billion.

In sum, even though energy investors might respond negatively to a Warren victory, her proposed crackdown on Big Oil would face enormous challenges, from court fights and economic pressure to a potential political backlash.

""The market could overreact,"" RBC analysts wrote, ""which may provide fundamental buying opportunities.""

In other words, Warren's bark may be tougher than her bite, at least when it comes to oil."

Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday met swift criticism from her 2020 Democratic rivals after she would not explicitly state that, under the ""Medicare for All"" plan she supports, many middle class families will see a tax hike.",2019-10-16,CNN,Warren comes under fire from 2020 Democratic rivals over 'Medicare for All',https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/15/politics/warren-medicare-for-all-debate/index.html,"(CNN) Elizabeth Warren got a taste of the front-runner life during a heated debate on Tuesday in Ohio , as the moderate candidates onstage bombarded her throughout the night and, during an especially pointed exchange, assailed the Massachusetts senator over her refusal to directly explain how she would fund ""Medicare for All.""

The question during the CNN/New York Times debate that set off the onslaught was a familiar one: Would Warren raise taxes on middle class Americans to pay for a single-payer health care program? Warren's response, too, was consistent with what she's said in the past -- but didn't provide a clear answer.

""My view on this and what I have committed to is, costs will go down for hard-working middle-class families,"" Warren said, again stressing that taxes on ""the wealth and big corporations"" would fulfill the bulk of the financing before pledging that she would ""not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families.""

But the stage was not satisfied. And with that, a nearly three-hour storm began -- and it was Warren most often standing under the angriest clouds.

South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg , who was aggressive throughout the night, called Warren ""evasive"" and, addressing her directly, said: ""Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this."" Sen. Amy Klobuchar , who repeatedly pivoted to Warren when asked a question, also took direct aim at her Senate colleague's murky explanation.

""We owe it to the American people,"" she said, ""to tell them where we will send the invoice.""

Sen. Bernie Sanders , who has been careful not directly criticize his progressive ally, defended Medicare for All after Buttigieg zeroed in on the policy itself -- but added, as he's stated before, that taxes would go up nearly across the board in order to pay for the plan.

""As somebody who wrote the damn bill, let's be clear: Under the Medicare for All bill I wrote, premiums are gone, copayments are gone, deductibles are gone. All out-of-pocket expenses are gone,"" Sanders said, before adding, ""But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up"" mostly for the wealthy, but also for some middle class Americans.

Sanders, as he's done on the trail, argued that the implementation of Medicare for All would, despite those tax hikes, mean that most Americans would be paying significantly less overall. Warren makes the same point, but her consistent demurrals when faced with the tax question -- on the campaign trail, when it's been posed by voters at rallies, and on the debate stage -- set up Medicare for All critics for a predictable pile-on.

But the scrap over health care was only a modest preview of what was coming for Warren, who has topped the field in a number of recent polls of early-voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire. Lower-performing rivals like former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and Sen. Kamala Harris gave the debate a feeling, at times, of being a referendum on Warren.

After the debate, Warren's campaign described the incoming volleys as more evidence of the candidate's growing stature and prospects.

""Elizabeth Warren has built momentum by running a campaign of substance, identifying problems facing the country and laying out her plans for big structural change to fix them,"" communications director Kristen Orthman said. ""She took heat tonight as a result of that momentum, but she stayed focused on what's broken and how she plans to fix it with a government and an economy that works for the people.""

Former Vice President Joe Biden was more tempered than some others in his language, but he also accused Warren of being ""vague"" in her discussion of Medicare for All and, as he livened up as the debate pushed into its third hour, claimed to the be the only one the stage who had accomplished anything ""big.""

Warren answered that suggestion with a sharply confident reminder of her work in crafting and establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

""Following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people,"" Warren recalled. ""And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, don't even try because you will never get it passed.""

Biden jumped in after Warren finished to talk about his role in seeing that it did, telling her: ""I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it, so let's get those things straight, too.""

Warren answered his aggressive claims with a deadpan: ""I am deeply grateful to President Obama,"" she said, ""who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law.""

Harris picked a more narrow line of attack, pushing Warren -- who has been critical of Facebook's ad policy, which doesn't vet candidate's claims -- to follow her lead and demand Twitter suspend President Donald Trump's account.

""Sen. Warren, I just want to say that I was surprised to hear that you did not agree with me that, on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies,"" Harris said.

Warren responded by implicitly belittling the ambition of Harris' demand: ""I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter,"" she said. ""I want to push him out of the White House. That's our job.""

When Harris continued pushing, asking Warren to ""join me in saying that his Twitter account should be shut down,"" Warren turned her down with a flat ""no.""

In a Democratic primary campaign that has yet to see a candidate rewarded for explicitly attacking a particular rival, the attempts to wallop Warren are as likely to backfire as cut her down.

O'Rourke zeroed in after the wealth tax plans by Warren and Sanders became a point of contention, with businessman Andrew Yang saying the policy ""makes a lot of sense in principle,"" but questioned whether and how it would work in practice.

""Sometimes I think that Sen. Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other,"" O'Rourke said, ""instead of lifting people up and making sure this country comes together around those solutions.""

""I'm really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I'm punitive,"" Warren said. ""Look, I don't have a beef with billionaires,"" before reprising an argument that she's been making for years: that the wealthiest Americans owed a financial -- and moral -- debt to the country that helped facilitate their success.

Ultimately, it was Sen. Cory Booker who sought to pull Warren out of the barrel and tsk-tsk his rivals over both the tone and text of their criticisms.

""I have seen this script before. It didn't work in 2016 and it will be a disaster for us in 2020,"" Booker said, warning Democrats against ""tearing each other down because we have different plans."""

Bernie Sanders on how his sweeping health care plan -- which Warren has endorsed -- would be paid for.

""She's reviewing the revenue options suggested by the 2016 Bernie campaign along with other revenue options. But she will only support pay-fors that meet the principles she has laid out in multiple debates,"" a Warren campaign aide said in a statement provided to CNN.

The campaign aide also said that the total cost of Medicare for All is unknown and that estimates vary by trillions of dollars. They did not provide details on what ""other revenue options"" the campaign is studying, and declined to comment on whether Warren may eventually put out her own details on paying for Medicare for All.

A new study by the Urban Institute , released Wednesday, said that federal spending on health care would increase by roughly $34 trillion under a single-payer plan similar to Medicare for All. That's in line with earlier studies that pegged the cost at around $32 trillion.

While Sanders has not detailed how he would raise the revenue needed to pay for Medicare for All, he included a variety of options when he released his 2016 campaign proposal and his updated bill in April. Among those listed in his most recent iteration are a 4% levy on employees, exempting the first $29,000 in income for a family of four. He also suggests imposing new taxes on employers, hiking the marginal tax rate on those making above $10 million, boosting the estate tax and establishing a wealth tax.

Warren's campaign statement comes on the heels of a contentious presidential debate Tuesday night in Ohio, where Warren was asked no less than half a dozen times on stage about whether Sanders' signature health care platform would raise taxes on the middle class and how she would like to pay for it.

Every time, the Massachusetts Democrat -- standing squarely center stage as a new front-runner in the 2020 Democratic race for President -- refused to state that taxes would, in fact, go up for some Americans under her colleague's plan. Instead, she stuck to a well-rehearsed response about how costs would go up for corporations and the wealthy and come down for middle class families. She pledged that as President, she would not sign a health care bill into law unless it lowered costs for average Americans.

Sanders has also stressed that while he would impose taxes on the middle class, they would see their overall costs go down because they would no longer have to pay premiums, deductibles or co-payments when they seek care.

Warren's repeated dodges on questions about whether Medicare for All would result in higher taxes are notably out of character for the senator, whose candidacy for the White House has gained steady political momentum in large part thanks to her abundance of policy plans and a knack for explaining and advocating for those ideas clearly out on the campaign trail.

Less than four months out from the Iowa caucuses, Warren's support for Medicare for All has stood out as a rarity. Even as she has unveiled policy plans at a rapid clip since launching her campaign on New Year's Eve, on the issue of health care, Warren has chosen to hold back from releasing a proposal of her own. Instead, she has stuck to publicly backing Sanders' Medicare for All -- a bill that she co-sponsored in the Senate -- and has not said that she will release a comprehensive health care plan of her own in the 2020 race.

""I'm with Bernie,"" Warren has previously said when asked about her vision on health care.

Tuesday's debate laid bare the political risks of Warren's backing of Sanders' Medicare for All, and foreshadowed that she is likely to continue confronting questions and criticism about tax hikes that could result from Sanders' proposal.

South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg summed up Warren's predicament this way: ""Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this."" Former Vice President Joe Biden accused Warren of being ""vague.""

Minnesota Sen. Klobuchar also joined the chorus, imploring her Senate colleague to acknowledge what Sanders himself had said earlier in the evening: ""I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up.""

""At least Bernie is being honest here, saying how he's going to pay for this -- taxes are going to go up,"" Klobuchar said. ""Sorry Elizabeth, you haven't said that. We owe it to the American people to tell them where we will send the invoice.""

The grilling continued well after the debate ended. In an interview with CNN anchors and analysts later that spanned close to 20 minutes, Warren was again pressed multiple times to acknowledge that Sanders' Medicare for All plan would result in tax hikes for some American families. Once again, she stuck to her script.

""My commitment is: I will not sign a bill into law that raises costs on middle class families,"" Warren said.

There have been earlier signs that Warren and her campaign were leaving open wiggle room on Medicare for All.

At a town hall in Keene, New Hampshire, last month, Warren referred to Medicare for All as a ""framework,"" saying: ""Right now, what we've got in Medicare for All is a framework and it doesn't have the details.""

The senator's senior adviser on the campaign, Joe Rospars , echoed that sentiment in a recent podcast interview, saying that some significant details have yet to be filled in on Sanders' Medicare for All plan.

""The question of the pay-for is: There's still a lot of details still to be filled in, in terms of both Bernie's bill that's out there but also the other versions of it, other candidates have their specific plans,"" Rospars said.

A veteran of Barack Obama's presidential campaigns, Rospars also said that he believes it's the ""overall cost"" of Medicare for All that most voters are focused on.

""I think there's a kind of disingenuousness to the — well, let's talk about taxes part of it,"" he said."

Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are riding waves of small donations. Billionaire Tom Steyer plowed eye-popping sums into his presidential campaign. And one White House contender reported raising just $5 during an entire three-month period. That's not a typo: yes, $5.

Here's a look at some of the key takeaways from third-quarter reports Democratic candidates just filed with federal election regulators:

Joe Biden burned through his money

Biden burned through his campaign donations over the summer -- spending more money than he took in and leaving him with just a fraction of the cash available to several of his better-funded rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Biden's campaign entered October with $8.98 million remaining in its bank account, after spending more than $17.6 million during the July-to-September quarter.

Biden raised nearly $15.7 million during the quarter, according to a report filed by his campaign late Tuesday, shortly after the conclusion of the Democratic presidential debate in Westerville, Ohio, sponsored by CNN and The New York Times.

Biden's cash position a little more than three months before the Iowa caucuses puts him at a big financial disadvantage to rivals such as Sanders, who reported having $33.7 million stockpiled for the primary slog ahead.

Two other Democratic presidential candidates -- Warren and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg -- have each stockpiled more than $20 million.

What's Biden spending money on? One-quarter of Biden's spending in the three-month period went to payroll, his filings show. His campaign also spent more than $920,000 on private planes.

Speaking to reporters Tuesday night following the debate, Biden's aides downplayed the campaign's financial hurdles.

""We've always said that we think this race is going to be a dog fight, that it's going to go long,"" campaign spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield said. ""We are 100% confident that we have what we need to run our race.""

Small donations add up for Sanders, Warren

Sanders relied on small-dollar donations for about 60% of his contributions over the summer -- giving him a pool of donors to tap repeatedly before they hit legal contribution limits.

Nearly $15 million -- or about 61% -- of the money Warren raised from individual contributors during the July-to-September fundraising quarter came from donors who donated $200 or less to the senator's presidential campaign. That helped her post one of the biggest fundraising hauls in the crowded field of Democrats vying to face President Donald Trump next year.

By comparison, small donations accounted for less than a third of Biden's donors.

Warren and Sanders, who represent the ultra-progressive wing of their party, swore off big-dollar fundraising in their campaigns for the Democratic presidential nomination, and their financial strength underscores the enthusiasm of online donors in the 2020 election.

They both outraised Biden and Buttigieg -- candidates who have relied, in part, on larger donors to fuel their White House ambitions.

""The concept is now proven: Candidates who want to focus on the people's agenda and be fueled by the people can totally succeed,"" Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and a Warren supporter, told CNN this week. ""That's a sea change.""

Warren recently promised to go further and forgo high-dollar fundraisers in the general election should she win the nomination, a stance that drew sharp criticism from Buttigieg.

""We're not going to beat Donald Trump with pocket change,"" he told Snapchat host Peter Hamby this week.

Staying power for Buttigieg, too

Buttigieg also spent heavily in the July-to-September period -- as he raced to assemble a staff of more than 300 nationally and build a ground game in Iowa ahead of the February 3 caucuses.

He raised a solid $19.1 million during the third quarter -- falling behind only Sanders and Warren. Despite his heavy spending, Buttigieg's strong fundraising over the course of the year has left him flush with cash. He started October with nearly $23.4 million available in his campaign accounts.

His campaign attracted some bold-faced donors in recent months, including designer Isaac Mizrahi and actresses Alyssa Milano and Jennifer Garner.

But here's a sobering statistic for Buttigieg and the entire Democratic field: Trump's campaign committee started October with $83.2 million in leftover funds. That's more cash on hand than held by the three top Democratic fundraisers combined.

Self-funding candidates

Steyer plowed a staggering $47.6 million of his hedge-fund fortune into his longshot bid for the White House, filings show. Other contributors donated $2 million, helping him fulfill the minimum donor threshold set by the Democratic National Committee to join Tuesday's debate.

Steyer is not the only self-funder in the race.

Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney continues to put his own money into the race. He donated $400,000 of his own funds to the campaign in the third quarter of this year.

How low can you go?

Among the 12 Democratic candidates who faced off on Tuesday night's debate stage, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro faces the biggest financial peril. The former mayor of San Antonio, Texas, raised nearly $3.5 million, but had just $672,000 remaining in his bank account at the end of September.

Former Reps. Beto O'Rourke of Texas and Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii had $3.3 million and $2.1 million, respectively, remaining in their bank accounts. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who also joined Tuesday's debate and made forceful attacks on Warren, had nearly $3.7 million left over in her campaign accounts.

Way, way back in the fundraising pack: Wayne Messam, the Miramar, Florida, mayor who has never gained traction in the Democratic presidential nomination.

His campaign reported receipts of exactly $5 in the July-to-September fundraising period in its filing with the Federal Election Commission. And because federal law doesn't require candidates to report details on donors who provide $200 or less to a campaign, it's hard to tell who provided the money. (Messam has had to correct his filings in the past; earlier this year he filed an amended report after mistakenly reporting he had raised nearly twice as much as he had actually collected.)

Tuesday's reports show the Democrat still had a little more than $31,000 remaining in his campaign's bank account.

(CNN) President Donald Trump's ears must have been burning as Democrats met in Ohio at the most crowded presidential debate in US history on Tuesday.

The 12 candidates at the CNN/New York Times debate conjured up visions of a vastly different America should they evict him from the White House in 2020. They'd reverse Trump's erratic, ""America First"" twists and turns, and restore the US leadership in the world -- somehow. But as the heated exchanges on health care, tax and billionaires showed, the Democratic Party still doesn't know how far left it wants to go.

Who won and lost a debate often takes a few days to become clear as viral moments ignite on social media and voters chew over the post-game analysis. But the early money suggests that this debate will not shake up the wider shape of the race. Former Vice President Joe Biden is a wobbly front runner. Elizabeth Warren has joined him in the top tier (and attacks that she faced on Tuesday night -- the most withering of her career -- show that the rest of the field knows it.)

While some outsiders did well -- like 30-something Pete Buttigieg and centrist Senator Amy Klobuchar, who brought sharp knives for Warren -- everyone else is still struggling to get a look in.

Four takeaways that will shape the campaign

The shadow of impeachment

Joe Biden, reaching for gravitas, said Trump's presidency was ""the most corrupt in modern history and all of our history."" Kamala Harris said the President had ""committed crimes in plain sight."" Elizabeth Warren said this was ""bigger than politics."" Whatever happens with the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump will tear America even further apart. And if one of the men or women on stage beats him at the polls, they'll end up with the job of trying to put it back together.

What about the Kurds?

All of the candidates agreed Trump was wrong to abruptly remove US troops from the side of Kurdish allies in Syria. But there was a strong isolationist strain onstage, in keeping with the mood of a nation exhausted by foreign wars. Co-frontrunner Warren did not quarrel with Trump's instinct to bring troops home, just with how he's doing it. ""I think we want to get out of the Middle East. I do think we should do it responsibly,"" she said. Until further notice, that is America's message to the rest of the world.

So that's what it's like to be a front-runner

Elizabeth Warren now knows what it's like to have a target on her back. Her rise to effective co-front-runner status exposed her to attacks from all sides on Tuesday. Both Buttigieg and Klobuchar piled on -- seeking to grab the middle ground of many Democrats who fear Warren and Sanders are too left wing. ""The difference between a plan and a pipedream is something you can actually get done,"" said Klobuchar, desperate for a viral moment as she struggles to reach polling thresholds to get her into the next debate.

In one of the most electric moments of the campaign, Biden and Warren -- the two most likely nominees -- clashed directly for the first time.

What heart attack?

Those two stents inserted into one of Bernie Sanders' arteries did the trick. The Vermont senator was ""feeling great"" and keen to wrest the debate away from Trump-bashing and back to his wheelhouse: health care, student debt and getting rid of billionaires. Sanders supporters will be relieved. But millions of moderate Americans watching at home might be more concerned at his frank admission that taxes will go up to pay for his ambitious social reforms.

Shameful. Shameful!

That was Biden letting off steam at Trump's decision to let Syria roll into northeastern Syria at the expense of America's Kurdish allies. The former vice president has much to vent about the President.

Brexit interlude

There's a generally held view of the European Union as an 11th hour decision-maker, working its way out of difficulties with late-night summits fueled by dozens of cups of coffee and pastries, and prime ministers and presidents only staggering out after midnight to announce a breakthrough.

Sometimes that really is what happens (it's also not uncommon for heads of state convening in Brussels to nip out for frites and a beer during negotiating breaks) but that's not how the EU likes to do things.

In fact, the European Council prefers to have its agenda set two weeks ahead of each summit. That gives the Commission -- its executive body -- time to analyze everything and make recommendations to member states, who also have to prepare. But Brexit is no ordinary agenda item.

This month, the EU has blown through one self-imposed deadline after another, as they try to settle the conditions of a UK exit from the union, before heads of government start turning up in Brussels. On Tuesday, they missed another deadline. As things stand now, no one will have time to digest any Brexit deal before the Thursday summit -- which could mean more stale pastries, fries and head-scratching in the middle of the night, instead.

Who said it? Debate edition

""I don't need lessons from you on courage — political or personal.""

""That is dead wrong.""

""It didn't work in 2016 and it will be a disaster for us in 2020.""

""The mainstream media, who have been championing and cheerleading this regime-change war.""

""You got the disastrous war in Iraq done.""

""MATH""

What good is a 12-person debate anyway?

Glad you asked.

The US electoral map is so vast that most Americans only see presidential candidates on TV, so these events are necessary for Democratic officials to build enthusiasm among voters, reaching tens of millions of viewers -- and not just Democrats. And the crowded field offers more than a soundbite fest — it fleshes out a broader divide between liberal and moderate positions that grassroots voters must adjudicate before choosing a candidate.

There is something quintessentially American about opening the White House race to everyone. The last two US presidents have been a rookie senator from Illinois and a businessman from New York with almost no political experience between them and little in common. Debates are part of a process that must be sufficiently elastic to accommodate sharp shifts in public opinion over a four year cycle.

In a populist age, party elites fear charges of dictating voters' choices, and the field will narrow soon enough anyway. When it does, the debates will have been good practice for the eventual Democratic nominee, who must debate Donald Trump a year from now. Whether they're the right way to pick a decent president is a whole other ballgame."

In a speech citing landmark Supreme Court cases and historical figures such as Frederick Douglass, Zuckerberg told an audience at Georgetown University that during times of social upheaval, policymakers have instinctively sought to limit the freedom of speech.

""The impulse is to pull back from free expression,"" he said. But, he continued, ""We are at a crossroads. We can either stand for free expression ... or we can decide the cost is simply too great. We must continue to stand for free expression.""

Zuckerberg had said in a Facebook post Wednesday that the speech would reflect his lengthy, ""unfiltered"" views on threats to free speech worldwide and the speech-related problems that the internet has created.

Speaking with a tinge of wonder and amazement in his voice, Zuckerberg offered soaring assessments of social media's promise, citing powerful movements that organized digitally such as #MeToo and Black Lives Matter — the latter of which, he said, first became a hashtag on Facebook itself.

But invoking civil rights icons like Martin Luther King, Jr. and historic cultural uprisings didn't sit well with Zuckerberg's critics in the civil rights community. Alicia Garza, a cofounder of Black Lives Matter, said Thursday that Zuckerberg had co-opted the organization's name to make a point.

""If he wants to use our movement to claim support for Black communities, then Black lives have to matter more than his bottom line,"" Garza tweeted

Color of Change, a civil rights advocacy group, said Facebook needs to be held to a higher standard.

""Facebook's ultimate hypocrisy,"" it said, ""is touting the platform's contributions to social justice movements like Black Lives Matter, but simultaneously rejecting any of the rules or regulations that would actually protect Black lives.""

Last spring, the largest Black Lives Matter page on Facebook was shut down after CNN revealed that the page was a scam tied to a middle-aged white man in Australia. The page helped raise thousands of dollars for the movement, but at least some of the money was later transferred to Australian bank accounts. Black Lives Matter had contacted Facebook about the page months earlier, suspecting it was a scam, but Facebook did not suspend the page until CNN's reporting.

During the speech, Zuckerberg pushed back on criticism of Facebook's handling of political advertising, saying he briefly considered banning political ads entirely from Facebook.

""From a business perspective,"" he said, ""the controversy certainly is not worth the very small part of our business that they make up."" But he ultimately decided against a ban, he said, concluding that political ads ""can be an important part of voice"" and that even if Facebook eliminated political ads from its platform, other types of ads could come under scrutiny as well, and it would be difficult to draw a line.

""I don't think most people want to live in a world where you can only post things that tech companies judge to be 100 percent true,"" Zuckerberg said.

Zuckerberg went on to discuss how tech companies — including his — pose a potential threat to freedom of expression, and returned to a familiar argument: That independent bodies should be responsible for developing rules and norms surrounding content.

He then pivoted to argue for his company's forthcoming oversight board , which will give users the ability to appeal Facebook's content decisions to a panel of outside experts.

Zuckerberg also reiterated another claim: That efforts to restrict US tech companies could lead to unintended consequences such as allowing Chinese competitors to dictate the terms of speech and innovation.

""If another nation's platforms set the rules, our nation's discourse could be set by a completely different set of values,"" he said. ""We should be proactive and write policies that help free expression triumph around the world.""

The entrepreneur said his concerns about freedom of expression extend beyond the United States, underscoring how Zuckerberg views himself and his company as being at the center of an epic struggle of ideas that has stretched on for centuries.

""Increasingly, we're seeing countries try to impose their speech restrictions beyond their country,"" Zuckerberg said during a question-and-answer session with students. He slammed a recent ruling by the European Court of Justice holding that Facebook can be required to delete content worldwide that is considered illegal in individual European countries.

""This is incredibly problematic and troubling,"" Zuckerberg added, saying there will undoubtedly be future litigation that Facebook will participate in seeking to establish how that ruling should be implemented.

Faced with two questions — one about allegations of Facebook's bias against conservatives and one about Facebook's outreach to conservatives — Zuckerberg quipped, to laughter: ""I think it would be hard to be biased against both sides.""

Facebook has recently found itself at the center of a debate about truthfulness in political ads after Facebook declined to remove an ad by President Trump's campaign that contained unfounded allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden. The result has been an uproar over Facebook's policy allowing politicians to lie in their campaign advertisements.

Bill Russo, a spokesman for Biden's campaign, accused Zuckerberg on Thursday of having ""attempted to use the Constitution as a shield for his company's bottom line.""

""His choice to cloak Facebook's policy in a feigned concern for free expression,"" he added, ""demonstrates how unprepared his company is for this unique moment in our history and how little it has learned over the past few years.""

Facebook and many legal experts have defended the company's right not to censor political candidates, but some critics including Sen. Elizabeth Warren have slammed the company for running what Warren termed a ""disinformation-for-profit machine.""

Asked about calls by politicians including Warren for the breakup of Facebook, Zuckerberg referred to a previously leaked recording of his remarks at a companywide meeting at which he'd acknowledged that a Warren presidency could mean an antitrust lawsuit filed by the US seeking that breakup. Zuckerberg at first said he didn't have much more to add. But in the event of a lawsuit to break up the company, he said, ""of course we'll stand up for ourselves and for what we believe is right.""

Despite the companies' efforts, concerns about the tech industry's handling of offensive speech and disinformation have continued to mount as the 2020 election cycle gets underway.

Google GOOG Facebook has launched a civil rights task force to monitor for election and census interference, andhas hired some 10,000 employees worldwide to tackle content moderation.

But skeptics say the companies have dragged their feet for too long. At a congressional hearing Wednesday, Oregon Republican Rep. Greg Walden said social media companies have been too ""slow to clean up"" their platforms while too quick to claim legal immunity for content under a law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.

""Many of our concerns can be readily addressed if companies just enforce their terms of service,"" said Walden."

(CNN) In Tuesday night's Democratic presidential debate, I'm afraid most of the candidates blended into the stage for me at some point. But that doesn't mean there wasn't a star among them. Here's how each candidate performed:

Bernie Sanders: A

Throughout the three-hour event, Sen. Sanders was consistently sharper than normal, and he outperformed the others, especially Elizabeth Warren, when explaining the financials of his healthcare plan. I liked his attitude about his health: we can judge it by watching him take the campaign by storm. He was the star of the evening.

Sanders remained firm and defiant when it was called for, asserting that nobody can trust our foreign policy because President Donald Trump is unpredictable. And when Joe Biden heated up toward the end of the debate, saying,""I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done,"" Sanders was ready to put things in perspective by replying: ""You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA (The North American Free Trade Agreement) and PNTR (Permanent Normal Trade Relations), with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs.""

Overall, Sanders' nonverbal communication -- typically hyper with lots of hand-waving -- was reined in, and that served him well. His animation was kept to a minimum, which was smart and effective.

Kamala Harris: A-

Sen. Harris flourished by doing the opposite of Sanders. Rather than being restrained, she brought a bit more energy to her debate performance, which she needed.

On the topic of abortion, nobody was more powerful than Harris, who declared: ""Women are the majority of the population in this country. People need to keep their hands off of women's bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives."" And Harris got the better of Elizabeth Warren when asking Warren to support the suspension of President Trump's Twitter account.

But a couple of stories didn't land. For instance, when debating a tax credit to close the income gap, Harris told a childhood anecdote about her mom sitting at the kitchen table wondering how to ""make it all work."" In the past, Harris has hit home runs with these personal stories, but this time around, she had none that were especially memorable.

Pete Buttigieg: B

Mayor Pete was pretty effective in policy arguments. He provided several options for depoliticizing the Supreme Court, and more than held his own on health care and gun control. Buttigieg also won most of the direct skirmishes he entered with other candidates. He got the best of Tulsi Gabbard when discussing Syria and keeping our military commitments. He called out Elizabeth Warren when she failed to satisfactorily explain how she'd pay for Medicare for All.

But then he slipped up when he made a back-and-forth about gun control with Beto O'Rourke needlessly personal. After O'Rourke remarked that policymakers should ""lead and not be limited by the polls and the consultants and the focus groups,"" Buttigieg retorted: ""I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal."" The remark seemed to come from left field. Mayor Pete responded as if he was called a coward, but that simply wasn't the case.

Phantom attacks like these happen often in competitive debates when expectations of an opponent's arguments don't always match the reality of what has been said. It was an unfortunate miscalculation by Buttigieg.

Cory Booker: B

Sen. Booker had a good tone throughout the evening. He was conversational, which is what I teach my students to strive for. Booker was also solid on content, consistently taking arguments one step further, like when he mentioned how anti-abortion laws disproportionately affect low-income women and the need to talk about child poverty when discussing tax systems.

On the downside, Booker focused too much energy on chastising everyone else over their tones and argument style when talking to one another (he was right, but then he overplayed his hand and his criticism seemed canned). Speaking of canned, what was the joke about Bernie Sanders being a fan of medical marijuana? Round peg, meet square hole.

Andrew Yang: B-

Bold ideas suit him well. While Yang's defense of his Freedom Dividend (a universal basic income of $1,000 a month) was lacking in support in this debate, he made up for it by defending other unconventional ideas. Yang floated the idea of decriminalizing opioids, which impressively got support from O'Rourke. Yang was smart to point out that Elizabeth Warren's plan to implement a wealth tax has been tried. ""The problem is that it's been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all those countries ended up repealing it, because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they'd projected,"" Yang said.

There were a few arguments where Yang was less successful. Booker overshadowed him on the topic of breaking up large tech companies. While Yang expressed skepticism over some benefits of breaking them up, Booker pointed out that the issue is not just competition, but that these large monopolies ""undermine our democracy.""

Yang also could use a bit more practice finishing his arguments. While he made a good point that our data should be treated as our property, his analysis was incomplete. Yang needed to more fully explain what having control of our data would mean for Americans.

Julian Castro: C+

He all but disappeared in parts of the debate, so it was difficult for him to climb the grading scale. However, Castro had some on-point analysis when discussing why communities don't want cops coming to their house under the guise of confiscating assault weapons. This approach was bold but risky. It could work against him if his criticism of weapon confiscation is interpreted as anti-police.

Elizabeth Warren: C

Sen. Warren needs to answer the questions. She is simply too smart to ignore the topic she is being asked to address -- especially when she's asked the same thing multiple times. Should Trump's Twitter account be suspended? I personally don't know -- and neither, it seems, does Warren. How is she planning to pay for Medicare for all? Again, she left us wondering,

Warren also came across as petty by implying it was not Biden but President Obama who should be credited with helping some of her bills become laws during the Obama administration.

Amy Klobuchar: C

While I found her delivery to be less than optimal at times, Klobuchar had some good points. She spoke thoughtfully on Roe v. Wade, taking on Big Pharma and income inequality.

Unfortunately, Klobuchar got caught in an awkward nonverbal moment when Castro was speaking on the topic of monopolies and the camera panned over to her. Her blank expression reminded me of when I catch a student on a cell phone during class. It's a good reminder to look engaged at all times -- you never know when you'll be in the spotlight.

If I could give her one piece of advice it would be to please stop using the scripted jokes. No one is laughing.

Beto O'Rourke: C

O'Rourke was simply average the entire time. He argued better than he did during the first debate, but was an expected let-down from his last debate. Unfortunately, the issue of guns, which he has made a central point of his campaign, was probably the worst part of his performance on Tuesday. O'Rourke needed more evidence to support his belief that owners of AR-15s and AK-47s will voluntarily give up their weapons under an assault rifle ban.

Joe Biden: C-

The best part of former Vice President Joe Biden's debate came toward the end when he highlighted his accomplishments. While still not as smooth as it could have been, he made a convincing argument: ""I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done, from the Violence Against Women Act to making sure that we pass the Affordable Care Act to being in a position where we, in fact, took almost a $90 billion act that kept us from going into a depression...""

Unfortunately, this came a bit late in the night. And for every good answer, Biden had multiple slipups. Examples include whatever this means: ""And lastly, and I apologize for going on, but lastly, what is happening in Iraq is going to -- I mean, excuse me, in Afghanistan, as well as all the way over to Syria, we have ISIS that's going to come here ..."" Once you've fumbled that much, you've lost the audience.

Biden needs to take his own advice and eliminate some of the clutter in his mind when he's answering questions. As he said in the debate, ""And this is one of the reasons why these debates are kind of crazy, because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given."" Exactly.

Tulsi Gabbard: D

Congresswoman Gabbard probably put off a lot of people with her responses. Drawing from the Republican playbook, she complained about the mainstream media and pointed out that she disagreed with Hillary Clinton on many issues. At the end of the night, when candidates were asked to explain a surprising friendship, Gabbard talked about her relationship with Republican Trey Gowdy. The same Trey Gowdy that Trump tried to hire for his impeachment defense team

However, my favorite part of the whole debate was when apparently Gabbard tried to take over the moderators' jobs and pose a question to the other candidates. She was quickly shut down when moderator Erin Burnett jumped in and announced a commercial break.

Tom Steyer: D

This was Steyer's first debate, and I had no problem with any of his answers, so in that regard, it was a success. But on public speaking 101, he failed. Have you ever met a person who never breaks eye contact until you feel uncomfortable? Steyer's nonstop eye contact with the camera made me feel the need to look away. It looked totally unnatural. We can only hope that he watches himself back and makes a note to blink in the next debate."

But there's a growing chorus on Wall Street for investors to look beyond the FANG momentum plays and more toward value stocks.,2019-10-16,CNN,Invest like Warren Buffett — Is this value's time to finally shine?,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/16/investing/value-stocks-growth/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Is the market's love affair with Big Tech finally coming to an end? That might be a stretch. But there's a growing chorus on Wall Street for investors to look beyond the FANG momentum plays and more toward value stocks.

In other words, investors are pulling a Warren Buffett.

Companies in sectors like banking, energy and health care have started to mount a comeback after lagging growth stocks for the past half-decade. Those sectors typically don't trade at prices as high asand other large tech firms.

Theis up about 40% in the last five years while thehas soared more than 80% during the same time frame. But value stocks have narrowed the gap considerably as of late. The value index is up nearly 18.5% this year — not far behind the gain of 20% for the growth index.

Materials, industrials, energy and tech firms will probably show the strongest earnings growth in 2020, predicts John Augustine, chief investment officer for Huntington Private Bank — especially if the US and China reach a trade deal and the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates to keep the economy growing.

Slower global growth could make value more attractive

With the exception of tech, Augustine cites three other sectors that tend to trade at more reasonable prices than growth stocks. But even within tech, Augustine points out that much of the earnings growth for next year may come from semiconductor stocks, which are typically a lot cheaper than cloud software, social networking and e-commerce companies.

""If these earnings projections hold up, we could see more investors start to shift from growth to value,"" Augustine told CNN Business. ""These are all cyclical companies and could have a strong 2020.""

But there's more to value than cyclical companies. Many investors also flock to slower-growth but dependable companies that pay big dividend yields. That trend should continue now that interest rates are expected to fall further in the United States, and yields for Japanese debt and many government bonds in Europe have fallen into negative territory.

Coca-Cola KO Verizon VZ So Dow components likeandand other high-yielding stocks will become increasingly attractive.

""Given that companies in defensive sectors like utilities, consumer goods, telecommunications and real estate generally sport higher dividend yields than their cyclical counterparts, falling interest rates have also helped drive defensive stock leadership,"" said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research for FTSE Russell, in a recent report.

Growth — but at the right price

Still, some fund managers warn investors to not bail on momentum tech darlings just yet.

Brian Macauley, a portfolio manager with Broad Run Investment Management, which subadvises the Hennessy Focus Fund, told CNN Business he'd be wary of many big banks and materials companies due to concerns about slowing global growth. Just because a stock looks like a bargain does not mean that it can't fall further.

""Some stocks are cheap for the right reasons,"" Macauley said.

Booking Holdings BKNG CarMax KMX Keurig Dr Pepper KDP That's why he prefers to buy stocks that he thinks offer growth at a reasonable price — companies that may not have bargain basement valuations but can justify their price because of solid prospects.

The key, Ficklin told CNN Business, is to find market leaders that can weather any economic, political or other macro storms. It almost doesn't matter if they are value stocks or growth stocks. You just want dependability.

""Take away cyclical factors and quality growth should shine through."" he said. ""We want to own businesses for at least five years. We expect to own companies through a recession or other tough market environments.""

""It's fine to delineate your differences with other primary candidates. But the way we do it matters. It cannot be personal attacks, tearing folks down, doing so in a way that wounds us as a party,"" Booker told CNN's John Berman on ""New Day."" ""At the end of the day, we have to show that unity that's necessary to develop the kind of strength it needs to beat Donald Trump.""

""If we can't unify the Democratic Party, you're not going to have a great success in even trying to unify the nation,"" the New Jersey senator added.

On Tuesday night, Booker joined 11 other candidates at the fourth Democratic primary debate, hosted by CNN and The New York Times in Westerville, Ohio. The debate was marked by increasing aggressiveness among the different candidates, who are all looking to break out as the contest inches toward 2020. In particular, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren faced attacks by a number of her rivals who were looking to take shots at her now that she is a front-runner in the contest. At one point during the debate, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg accused Warren of dodging a yes-or-no question, and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar accused her of being dishonest.

""Last night (Warren) was more specific and forthcoming about the number of selfies she's taken than about how (her 'Medicare for All') plan is going to be funded,"" Buttigieg told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day"" Wednesday.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii walked onstage here at Otterbein University with a stark reality looming: This could be their last debate, as none of them have yet qualified for the November contest.

To make the November debate stage, candidates will have to reach 3% in at least four Democratic National Committee-approved polls of Democratic voters nationally or in one of the four early-voting states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina -- and raise money from 165,000 separate donors -- including a minimum of 600 donors each in at least 20 states or territories.

The reality for the four Democrats on the bubble is that none of them are that close to making the fourth debate. All the candidates have the needed donors, but only O'Rourke and Klobuchar have one of the needed polls.

While the four candidates enter the coming weeks of campaigning with a shared goal of appearing on the November stage, the distinctly different Democrats used different methods Tuesday night to set themselves apart.

Where Klobuchar was aggressive and direct, Castro -- who had been forceful in earlier contests -- was more muted and attacked less. Where Gabbard looked to score points by hitting her opponents at the end of nearly all of her answers, O'Rourke tried to be more selective in when to strike at his opponents.

The varying approaches highlight not only different political stances among the Democrats, but also divergent strategies on how each believed they will be able to drum up enough support to make the next debate.

Time for a 'reality check'

Klobuchar is the candidate who made the most notable change from her past appearances. In the first three debates, she was more muted, operating like she was alone on the stage and there only to make her particular policy points. On Tuesday, however, Klobuchar -- from the outset -- used her time to press Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, taking on the liberal lawmaker as a way to touting her own moderate bona fides.

Klobuchar accused Warren, now a front-runner in the primary contest, of being dishonest.

""We owe it to the American people to tell them where we will send the invoice,"" she said of Warren's continued dodge on whether middle-class taxes will go up to pay for the single-payer ""Medicare for All"" proposal she backs.

When Warren suggested that people onstage who disagree with her want to protect billionaires, Klobuchar shot back.

""I want to give a reality check to Elizabeth because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires,"" she said. ""Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires,"" she added, referring to businessman Tom Steyer.

Then she looked to undercut Warren's central argument: that she is in the race to fight for regular people, a suggestion that others are not.

""I think simply because you have different ideas doesn't mean you're fighting for regular people,"" Klobuchar replied. ""I wouldn't even be up on this stage if it wasn't for unions and the dignity of work.""

The performance was at a speed that few watching the earlier debates had seen from Klobuchar.

""Amy made the clearest case tonight,"" said Christina Reynolds, a top staffer at Emily's List and former aide to Hillary Clinton. ""She looked at it and said, 'I'm going to make the clear case for being the moderate candidate.' .... That's her case. And she made that case really well.""

While Klobuchar denied that she had been any different on Tuesday night -- ""I have been literally the same person from the beginning. This debate was longer and I got more airtime and I had more of a chance to do it,"" she said -- a senior aide to the senator said the prospect of missing the November debate was ""in the back of her mind some.""

""She's been saying the same thing, but we set it up more aggressively, more forcefully today, because I think it's more important than ever for people to understand,"" the aide said.

For his part, Castro went away from the more pointed strategy he had employed in September's debate -- one that earned some negative reviews -- and delivered a more subdued approach.

Castro, in the most-buzzed-about moment of his night, accused Trump of ""caging kids on the border"" and ""effectively letting ISIS prisoners run free"" in Syria. But his lack of aggression toward his fellow Democrats stood out, especially after the Texas Democrat had repeatedly gone after Joe Biden in the Houston debate over the former vice president's memory.

Castro insisted there had been no change in strategy on Tuesday.

""What I felt is that I needed to go out there and to continue to articulate a strong, compelling vision for the future of our country,"" he said. ""And I think that I did that.""

But the reviews from unaffiliated Democrats were not glowing.

""Castro totally faded,"" said Mo Elleithee, a longtime Democratic operative. ""When you are on the bubble, you cannot afford to fade into the background. You have to find the opportunities.""

Like Castro, O'Rourke denied that the prospect of making the fifth debate was on his mind as he took the stage on Tuesday.

""I really wasn't"" thinking about it, he said. ""I'm really focused on making sure that I see things as clearly as possible, speaking about them as honestly as possible.""

And O'Rourke's strategy backs that up: The former congressman delivered an even debate performance that at times mimicked the directness he has brought to past contests.

O'Rourke accused Warren of being ""punitive"" on certain issues regarding wealth and entered into a heated exchange with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg over guns.

The moments echoed some that O'Rourke had at earlier debates, suggesting that the Texas Democrat who entered the presidential race with sky-high hopes believes what he has been doing will be enough to land him on the debate stage again.

The wild card of the night in this group of bubble Democrats was Gabbard, who was back on the stage after failing to qualify for September's debate.

Gabbard, a Hawaii congresswoman and Iraq War veteran, was aggressive on Tuesday, regularly closing her questions by asking other candidates directly to join her in certain policy proposals that she knows are out of step with others in the field.

The most contentious moment came when she argued that the violence in Syria at the hands of Turkey was, in part, to blame on Washington politicians who ""who have supported this ongoing regime-change war in Syria that started in 2011."" Gabbard said at one point that ""politicians in our country from both parties"" have ""the blood of the Kurds"" on their hands.

Buttigieg, the only other veteran onstage, aggressively attacked her answer, calling her ""dead wrong.""

For Gabbard, though, the moment could be viewed as a win for her devout following, who, for the most part, are anti-interventionist.

The group expects fundraising through the platform to hit $3 billion by the end of the 2020 cycle -- a measure of Democratic enthusiasm ahead of next year's high-stakes White House and congressional races.

The nonprofit, which helped Democrats win control of the House of Representatives in 2018, said more contributions were made in the third quarter than in any other since ActBlue started in 2004. Small-dollar donors have now given more than $700 million this year alone, the organization said.

The record-breaking amount of small-dollar contributions comes as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who both swore off big-dollar fundraising, amassed the two largest third-quarter fundraising hauls. Both senators outraised candidates who have relied, in part, on larger donors to fuel their presidential campaigns.

The average donation size using ActBlue this past quarter was $28, and 1 million new unique donors used the platform. In the third quarter, 58% of donations were made using a mobile device, which is the highest percentage ever of donations made in a single quarter.

Kamala Harris on Wednesday defended her calls for Twitter to suspend President Donald Trump's account, a plan she reiterated on stage at the fourth Democratic primary presidential debate hosted by CNN and The New York Times.

Harris first made her call following the President's tweets about the whistleblower complaint at the center of the Ukraine scandal. During Tuesday night's debate, Harris called out Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, one of the field's front-runners, for not following her lead in saying Trump's Twitter account should be taken down. Warren brushed off Harris' proposal, saying she didn't just want to ""push Trump off Twitter"" but also out of the White House.

The contentious moment led to some criticism for Harris, including from former US National Security Council spokesperson Tommy Vietor, who called Harris' push during the debate ""small ball.""

Harris, however, told CNN's John Berman on ""New Day"" Wednesday that Trump's ""threatening remarks"" about the whistleblower and others is a ""serious matter.""

""It's a serious matter. And it is a matter of the safety of those individuals,"" she said. ""You can look at the fact that the shooter in El Paso was influenced by the words that the President of the United States, unfiltered, uses through this medium on Twitter. He has 65 million followers. And we have to take seriously the implications that are about the threatening witnesses, intimidating witnesses and obstructing justice.""

She added: ""When witnesses are threatened by the President of the United States, it is a very serious matter. And people will be influenced by those threats. And we have to say that it is not OK and that he has revoked his privilege to use this platform because it is a privilege that can be and should be taken away.""

Harris also said companies like Facebook and Twitter need to adopt the same set of standards to govern what is allowed on their platforms.

""And the point also has to be, you can't have one set of standards for Facebook and another for Twitter,"" she said on Wednesday. ""All of these social media companies and these online platforms, which are so powerful in their ability to impact perception about an issue and to influence behaviors. Let's be clear about that. There have to be standards, and the standards have to be the same. You can't have one standard for Facebook and another for Twitter.""

While companies like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter collaborate closely and are closely aligned on policing content from terrorist groups, each is a separate company and has their own set of standards for political speech.

In May, for instance, when a fake video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi circulated, the three major platforms acted differently. YouTube removed the video, Facebook let the video stay online but downranked it meaning it would be seen by less people and Twitter allowed the video to stay online.

Earlier this month, Harris sent a letter to the Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey listing six tweets by the President that she says violated Twitter's rules. The White House called Harris' demand ""authoritarian"" and defended Trump's use of Twitter.

""It is not surprising that Kamala Harris, someone who believes in bigger government and more regulation, would like to silence her political opponents,"" the White House said in a statement. ""In fact, it's rather authoritarian of her. President Trump's use of technology to communicate directly with the American people and share his Administration's unprecedented accomplishments should be praised, not criticized.""

On Tuesday, Twitter issued a clarification in a blog post on rules for tweets by world leaders, saying ""that the accounts of world leaders are not above our policies entirely."" The social media network reiterated its announcement from June that some tweets from world leaders that break its rules would not be removed from the platform if the company decided they were in the ""public interest."" Twitter said it would instead put a disclaimer on the tweets explaining that although they broke the company's rules they would not be removed.

Twitter has not labeled any of Trump's tweets in this way."

She is active in coalition efforts to reform our private retirement system to ensure an adequate, secure, and affordable retirement for all workers. She is a member of the National Academy of Social Insurance. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.

(CNN) America is facing a looming crisis as generations of workers who mostly participated in do-it-yourself savings plans — or no plan at all — approach retirement.

Though a few high-income households have amassed small fortunes in tax-favored retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s and IRAs, at least half of working households are expected to see a steep drop in their living standards once they retire due to the decline of traditional pensions, a lack of savings and cuts to Social Security. That not only poses big risks for America's seniors, but it threatens the US economy as well.

Members of Congress are waking up to the problem and proposing a flurry of Social Security expansion plans that could help alleviate the crisis. One of the most promising bills , championed by Rep. John Larson, would expand benefits by 2% for most workers — more for low earners. It would raise enough revenue to fund these benefits and to close a projected shortfall by slowly increasing the payroll tax rate and by taxing earnings above $400,000. Earnings above $132,900 aren't currently subject to Social Security tax, but most expansion plans, like Larson's, would scrap or amend this cap to raise revenue. So far, Larson's proposal has garnered a lot of support from fellow Democrats, with more than 200 sponsors.

The latest proposal, from Sen. Elizabeth Warren , goes even further. Warren's plan provides for an extra $200 per month for beneficiaries — a roughly 15% increase for the average beneficiary and a nearly 25% increase for low-income seniors. Her plan, like some of her predecessors', also includes targeted benefits for caregivers, surviving spouses and college and vocational students with a parent who has a disability or has died.

The combination of targeted and across-the-board benefits would reduce the number of seniors in poverty by almost 5 million while also helping many younger and better-off beneficiaries. To pay for these benefits and extend the solvency of the program, Warren would impose a slightly higher payroll tax rate on earnings over $250,000 and tax investment income received by high-income taxpayers. Warren's plan shares some features with an earlier proposal by Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Peter DeFazio that would scrap the cap for earnings above $250,000 and tax investment income in order to raise benefits by 5% for average retirees and more for low earners.

Both of these plans would improve Social Security's finances and restore some of the benefits Congress cut in 1983, when Social Security was facing an imminent funding crisis. Behind these commonalities are differences in emphasis. Larson's plan would eliminate the entire 75-year projected shortfall but provide more modest benefit increases. Warren's plan would provide bigger and more progressive benefit increases, but would only extend the system's solvency through 2054.

The latest tactic used against expansion is feigning concern for the economy. Expanding Social Security, some claim , would slow the economy by discouraging work and redistributing income from higher-income households (who save) to lower-income households (who spend), thus supposedly starving business, government and households of funds needed for investment. But as we pointed out in a critique of a Penn Wharton Budget Model analysis, taxing earnings has an ambiguous effect on work effort. And raising the income of beneficiaries increases consumer demand and boosts economic growth except when the economy is already operating at full employment.

Though the unemployment rate is historically low today — which in the past might have signaled an economy running at capacity and threatening to overheat — people are still entering the workforce at a healthy clip, blunting upward pressure on wages and prices. Many prominent economists argue persuasively that the biggest macroeconomic problem we face in the 21st century isn't a lack of investment capital or willing workers, but a global savings glut and chronically weak spending. As John Maynard Keynes and other economists have long recognized, what might be prudent for the individual can harm the economy if it saps consumer demand for goods and services.

Without Social Security and other pay-as-you-go social insurance programs that reduce the need for private saving and modestly favor low-income beneficiaries, interest rates would have to be negative to prevent the economy from contracting, wrote former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers in The Washington Post last spring. In other words, Social Security isn't dragging down the economy, it's helping keep it afloat.

Reasonable people can differ about how to bolster Social Security's finances, but either of the plans currently before Congress would leave future retirees — and the economy — much better off."

In November, GM announced plans to close Lordstown as well as transmission plants in Warren, Michigan, and Baltimore, Maryland and Hamtramck, in Detroit. Under the proposed labor deal reached Wednesday, Hamtramck will get a new lease on life, with a chance to build electric trucks. But the company was offering that even before the union went on strike on Sept. 16.

""It is with sadness that, with this agreement, three of those four facilities will close,"" said the union's summary of the deal's terms.

The union said it did win enhanced retirement and buyout packages for affected employees. It also disclosed that GM plans to close a parts distribution center outside of Los Angeles sometime during the life of this contract. It has 31 hourly workers.

During contract negotiations, the United Auto Workers union had demanded GM bring some of the trucks it builds in Mexico to the US plants.

There were more than 3,000 union jobs at the four plants when plans to close them were announced in November. GM said it found jobs for about 2,300 of the workers at the four plants, although many had to relocate

On Thursday morning a group of workers from Lordstown were outside the meeting room where union officials were considering the proposed four year contract deal . They were chanting ""No product, no vote,"" to union officials as they entered the room, trying to push them one last time to demand that GM bring back a vehicle to build in Lordstown.

""It's depressing because so many people depend on it, and so many people left the community with the thought in their mind that, you know what? Our union's strong and our union's going to get us back to work in Lordstown one day,"" said Tommy Wolikow, a former Lordstown worker.

Wolikow is still with GM, having transferred to a GM plant in Flint, Michigan not long before the Lordstown plant stopped building cars. He said many workers from Lordstown who moved to other states to take GM jobs left their families behind, but did so with the expectation that they would be able to move back to Lordstown to be with their families again.

""To hear this news that we might not get another General Motors product, it's just devastating,"" he said.

A striking member of the UAW outside the Lordstown, Ohio, plant on the first day of the strike. Despite hopes of some employees, the deal to end the strike will not revive the plant that halted production in March.

The 32-day walkout by 50,000 GM workers centered on issues including a path to permanent work for temporary workers, pay raises or lump sum payments for UAW members and promises of investment at US plants.

GM agreed to eventually start building a new electric truck at the Hamtramck assembly plant, the company's last remaining plant within Detroit city limits. But GM has yet to reveal a prototype of the truck, known as a concept vehicle in industry parlance.

That means construction of the truck is likely more than a year in the future. Since GM plans to halt production of the sedans it now builds at Hamtramck early next year, the plant will likely be dark for an extended period.

GM also agreed to invest in some new plants in the Lordstown area, including one that would build lithium ion batteries to power electric cars. And it is looking at a possible sale of the Lordstown plant to a company that may build electric vehicles there. But it is not clear how many jobs those plants will produce, and they are unlikely to pay what veteran autoworkers at GM now earn.

The tentative agreement needs the approval of both union leadership as well as the rank-and-file union members at GM before it can take effect. The union's National GM Council, made up of those who represent GM workers nationwide, was meeting to consider the agreement Thursday."

The DNA results did not bode well for Warren, despite her initial victory lap. The results showed that she possessed between 1/64th and 1/1024th Native American ancestry, or between 0.1 percent to 1.56 percent. Additionally, the results indicated that Warren’s minuscule Native American links were not associated with tribes in the United States, further casting doubt on her claims of Cherokee heritage.

President Trump pounced on the results.

“Pocahontas (the bad version), sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren, is getting slammed,” he wrote on October 16, 2018.

“She took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be 1/1024, far less than the average American. Now Cherokee Nation denies her, ‘DNA test is useless.’ Even they don’t want her. Phony!” he added:

“A DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship,” Cherokee Nation Secretary of State Chuck Hoskin Jr. said. “Current DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person’s ancestors were indigenous to North or South America”:

Using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong. It makes a mockery out of DNA tests and its legitimate uses while also dishonoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens, whose ancestors are well documented and whose heritage is prove. Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage.

The results followed Warren’s years of false Native American claims. She listed herself as a minority professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and Harvard Law School and claimed Native American heritage on her Texas Bar registration card.

She continued to tout false claims of Native American heritage into her 2012 senatorial bid, telling a reporter that she had pictures that reflected her Native American heritage but added, “I have plenty of pictures. They’re not for you,” leaving the purported evidence shrouded in mystery:

That same year, Warren told the story of her parents, claiming that her father’s parent’s disapproved of her mother because she – as Warren claimed – was part Cherokee and Delaware.

“If your family heritage had an African American like you have, the grandfather or great grandparent who was a Cherokee, would you call yourself a black, and expect African Americans to accept that?” New England Cable News’s Jim Braude asked Warren.

“If that same ancestor was black and not Cherokee,” he added.

“If my Father’s parents had said, ‘You can’t marry her because she’s black, and that had been part of our family growing up, that we had two different families?” Warren said.

“You would be comfortable with saying you’re black?” Braude asked.

“It would be part of identification,” Warren quipped:

While Warren has failed to offer an explicit and thorough explanation for her years of misleading claims, she has vaguely apologized for making a “mistake” and admitted that she is “not a person of color” and “not a citizen of a tribe.”

Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday night during the fourth Democrat primary debate.

Warren was attacked sixteen times during the debate, according to an NBC tracker, primarily on her proposals for universal health care and her proposed extreme wealth tax.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar attacked Warren five different times, while former Vice President Joe Biden and Mayor Pete Buttigieg attacked her on three different occasions.

Kamala Harris and Beto O’Rourke attacked Warren on two occasions each, and Andrew Yang attacked her one time.

Klobuchar defended her attacks, saying that she wanted to be president of all of America, not just half of America.

“If people are tired of the noise and nonsense and the extremes, they’ve got a home with me,” she said afterward to CNN.

Klobuchar said that Warren’s Medicare-for-all was a “pipe dream” and she did “not even come close” to answering the question about how she planned to pay for her plan.

“As I’ve said, Bernie [Sanders] has answered that question, he’s made that very clear, and I think that’s one of the things she needs to do,” she said afterward.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who signaled his criticism of Warren’s plan in a campaign ad earlier Tuesday, immediately challenged Warren on her healthcare plan.

Sen. Kamala Harris challenged Warren for failing to join her call to ban President Donald Trump from Twitter. Biden repeated that Warren was being “vague” on the cost of her healthcare plan.

The attacks on Warren spoke volumes to the pundits, who described her as the clear frontrunner for the Democrat primary.

Biden, who experienced the brunt of the attacks in the early debates, was only attacked twice."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is making strides with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and is expected to meet with the group’s fundraising arm, making her and Joe Biden the only Democrat 2020 candidates to do so, according to Axios.

Warren is expected to meet with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) Bold PAC on Thursday, following what many consider to be a solid debate performance on Tuesday evening.

According to Axios, much of the discussion will revolve around immigration reform – a topic that was virtually ignored at the CNN/New York Times-hosted Democrat debate in Westerville, Ohio.

“We want to make sure whoever the nominee is doesn’t waffle on this,” Bold PAC political director Gisel Aceves said, according to Axios.

“Our members are acutely aware of how important and consequential this election is obviously to the country, but also how the Hispanic community has been attacked by this administration,” Aceves added.

While some of the 38 CHC Bold PAC members have endorsed a 2020 candidate, the caucus as a whole has not. The fundraising wing has only met with one other candidate: former vice president Joe Biden. He reportedly met with the CHC Bold PAC during the summer, around the same time he was dominating national polls. However, the political landscape has drastically shifted since their meeting in July, with Warren steadily making her way to the top and leading Biden in several national and early primary and caucus state polls.

The Massachusetts senator has broadly outlined her vision for immigration reform, expressing support for a full open borders policy at the U.S.-Mexico border and vowing in a tweet this month to stop “unnecessarily” detaining illegal border crossers:

Too many immigrants have died in ICE custody. We need to ensure asylum seekers are welcomed, treated humanely, receive the medical care they need, and are not detained unnecessarily. I have a plan to rebuild a more humane immigration system. https://t.co/v3OZZHeGPd — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 3, 2019

As Breitbart News reported:

Warren’s statement came in response to a report that a Cameroon national detained by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency had died while in custody. Unmentioned, though, is that migrant deaths under the Trump administration are 20 percent lower than the rate of migrant deaths under former President Obama.

Warren’s essential call for open borders follows the speech she delivered to the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) union in September. She, inexplicably, told union members that granting amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants currently residing in the United States would be “good for all workers,” even though the move would “immediately drive up foreign competition in the labor market for America’s working and blue-collar class,” as Breitbart News noted.

“We need a pathway to citizenship for the people who are here and here to stay. They are our neighbors; they are our brothers and sisters. They are here,” Warren said during the speech.

“We need a path — not just for DREAMers — but also a path for grandmas, and for little kids, and for people who came here to work on farms, and for students who overstayed their visas. We need a path that is fair and achievable. Bring people out of the shadows,” she continued.

“It is good for all workers, and we need to get them into our unions,” she added."

CNN and the New York Times opened the fourth Democrat debate with impeachment. Moderator Anderson Cooper asked Warren why the House Democrats’ pursuit of impeachment is necessary, particularly with the presidential election right around the corner.

“With the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate? ” Cooper asked.

“Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry,” Warren said.

Warren said she “certainly didn’t think” impeachment would be a subject of interest when she decided to run for president but claimed the Mueller report – which did not show any evidence of collusion or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia – convinced her that Trump “obstructed justice and done it repeatedly,” despite the fact that Mueller made no such determination.

Warren continued:

At that moment, I called for an impeachment inquiry. Now that didn’t happen, and look what happened as a result. Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer. Broke it again this fall.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) – in making the case for the impeachment inquiry against President Trump – falsely claimed on Tuesday that the Mueller report showed that the president obstructed justice, despite that the former special counsel made no such determination.

The CNN/New York Times debate opened with a question on impeachment, and Warren said her call for an impeachment inquiry began with the results from the Mueller report, which showed no evidence of collusion or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.

She said she read the entire Mueller report and added, “When I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown, too, a fare-thee-well, that this president had obstructed justice and had done it repeatedly.”

“At that moment, I called for an impeachment inquiry. Now that didn’t happen, and look what happened as a result,” Warren continued, accusing Trump of breaking the law in the summer and the fall:

You know we took a Constitutional oath, and that is that no one is above the law, and that includes the President of the United States. Impeachment is the way we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences.

However, Mueller made no such determination on obstruction of justice. He made that point clear during his testimony before lawmakers in July.

As Breitbart News reported:

His correction came during his testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, in reference to comments he made at an earlier hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee to Lieu. Lieu asked him, “I’d like to ask you, the reason again, that you did not indict Donald Trump is because of OLC opinion stating that you cannot indict a sitting president, correct?” Mueller responded, “That is correct.” After Mueller’s response, Democrats latched on to his comment as evidence that Trump was guilty of obstruction of justice and that Mueller would have charged him if it were not a Justice Department legal office opinion.

Mueller corrected the record after the fact, reiterating that he did not make a determination on obstruction of justice:

Mueller stated:

I want to add one correction to my testimony this morning. I wanted to go back to one thing that was said this morning by Mr. [Ted Lieu (D-CA] — who said, and I quote, ‘You didn’t charge the president because of the [Office of Legal Counsel (OLC)] opinion.’ That is not the correct way to say it.

“As we say in the report and as I said in the opening, we did not reach a determination as to whether the president committed a crime,” he added.

Attorney General William Barr determined that Trump did not obstruct justice, explaining that “the evidence developed by the Special Counsel is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense.”"

Trump's response: ""He didn't say that at all.""

While we can't know what Erdogan might have told US officials in private, his public comments were unequivocal.

Trump's inaccurate denial was one of at least 12 false claims he made to reporters during an Oval Office meeting and subsequent joint press conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella.

Here's what we found:

The troops and Syria, part 1

Touting his decision to remove troops from northern Syria, Trump said, ""We're bringing our soldiers back home, and we've done a great job.""

Facts First: The soldiers are not being brought ""home,"" at least not yet. Trump : The soldiers are not being brought ""home,"" at least not yet. Trump announced Monday that ""United States troops coming out of Syria will now redeploy and remain in the region to monitor the situation and prevent a repeat of 2014, when the neglected threat of ISIS raged across Syria and Iraq."" He also announced last week that 1,800 more troops would be deployed to Saudi Arabia.

The troops and Syria, part 2

Trump said that the US military deployment to Syria was initially supposed to last just ""one month.""

Facts First: There was never any specific timeline for the US military's involvement in Syria, much less a timeline of a mere 30 days.

""There was never a 30-day timetable on the US presence in Syria,"" said Syria expert Steven Heydemann, a professor of government and director of the Middle East Studies program at Smith College. ""The previous administration, and officials serving in this administration, have never offered a fixed timetable for the US mission. Official statements have emphasized that the presence of US forces would be short, limited in scope, and small. But beyond general comments along those lines, there has been no statement indicating it would end after 30 days.""

The Ukraine conspiracy

Trump repeated his debunked allegations about a Ukrainian conspiracy related to the Democratic National Committee computer servers that were hacked in 2016.

""Where is the server? I want to see the server. Let's see what's on the server. So the server, they say, is held by a company whose primary ownership individual is from Ukraine. I'd like to see the server,"" he said.

Facts First: Trump appeared to be referring to : Trump appeared to be referring to CrowdStrike , a publicly traded cybersecurity firm that was hired to investigate the hack of DNC servers in 2016. The company was co-founded by Dmitri Alperovitch, an American citizen who was born in Russia, not Ukraine . There is no evidence that any physical DNC server is currently being ""held"" by CrowdStrike; such companies do not typically take possession of the actual servers to conduct their analysis.

CrowdStrike -- which, like former special counsel Robert Mueller, attributed the hack to Russia -- said in a previous statement: ""With regards to our investigation of the DNC hack in 2016, we provided all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI. As we've stated before, we stand by our findings and conclusions that have been fully supported by the US Intelligence community.""

The company has been hired by Republicans as well as Democrats. It has been paid during Trump's presidency by the National Republican Congressional Committee and National Republican Senatorial Committee, public records show.

The whistleblower

Trump claimed again that the whistleblower who filed a complaint about his July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was inaccurate, saying, ""The whistleblower's report was totally wrong. The whistleblower didn't know what he was talking about or was given false information or was even worse than that.""

Facts First: As we've : As we've explained repeatedly, the whistleblower's account of the call was proven highly accurate by the rough transcript released by the White House.

Stock market ownership

""If you look at people's stocks, their 401(k)s, if you look at anything you want to look at, they're far better off now than they probably ever have been in this country. Record stock markets. And don't forget, stock market is not just rich people. It's all people. Because all people own in the stock markets,"" Trump said.

Facts First: Trump was right that it's not only rich people who own stocks, but it's not true that ""all"" people own stocks. Roughly : Trump was right that it's not only rich people who own stocks, but it's not true that ""all"" people own stocks. Roughly half of Americans owned stocks as of 2017, according to academic studies and polls.

Wealthy people own a disproportionate share of stocks. A 2017 paper by New York University economist Edward Wolff found that the top 10% of households owned 84% of stocks in 2016.

The Soviet Union's ""downsizing""

Warning of the perils of getting involved in unwinnable wars, Trump said, ""You know, Russia was involved in Afghanistan. It used to be called the Soviet Union -- now it's called Russia for a reason. Because they lost so much money in Afghanistan that they had to downsize. A very big downsizing.""

Facts First: This was an exaggeration. Experts say the Soviet Union's failed war in Afghanistan was far from the only reason for its collapse, though it did contribute to it. (We'll ignore Trump's use of the term ""downsizing"" to describe the dissolution of the Soviet Union.) You can read a longer fact check : This was an exaggeration.

(We'll ignore Trump's use of the term ""downsizing"" to describe the dissolution of the Soviet Union.) You can read a longer fact check here

""Corruption""

Trump recited his usual complaints about how he was treated by US intelligence officials involved in investigating his campaign's relationship with Russia, including former FBI Director James Comey and former deputy director Andrew McCabe. This time, he accused former President Barack Obama of being involved in the supposed ""corruption.""

""There was a lot of corruption. Maybe it goes right up to President Obama. I happen to think it does,"" Trump said.

Facts First: There is simply no evidence of Obama corruption.

Military spending

Trump said, ""I spent $2.5 trillion over the last almost three years rebuilding our military.""

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. As noted by Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, total defense spending for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 was $2.05 trillion -- and that includes more than three-and-a-half months of Obama's tenure, since the 2017 fiscal year began in October 2016.

Harrison said he thinks Trump must have been including military funding for the 2020 fiscal year to get to ""$2.5 trillion"" figure -- but the 2020 fiscal year has just started, and ""the actual appropriations bills for FY20 are still pending in Congress.""

The nuclear arsenal

Trump said of the US nuclear arsenal: ""Our nuclear has been totally updated and in some cases new.""

Facts First: Experts say that Trump has not yet implemented significant changes to the US nuclear arsenal. ""I am not aware that Trump can claim to have done anything for the state of the nuclear arsenal -- but nothing urgent needed to be done anyway,"" said Scott Kemp, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Nuclear Security and Policy, who served as a State Department adviser on arms control early in the Obama administration.

You can read a longer fact check here

NATO contributions

Trump took credit for NATO member states increasing their defense spending, saying that Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg is ""going around saying that President Trump was able to raise over $100 billion last year, which is true.""

Facts First: This is at least a slight exaggeration -- and one Stoltenberg gently tried to correct when he met with Trump in April. Though Stoltenberg has indeed given Trump credit for pressuring NATO countries into boosting spending, he has said, to Trump and in other forums, that the extra $100 billion the countries will spend on their own militaries will come : This is at least a slight exaggeration -- and one Stoltenberg gently tried to correct when he met with Trump in April. Though Stoltenberg has indeed given Trump credit for pressuring NATO countries into boosting spending, he has said, to Trump and in other forums, that the extra $100 billion the countries will spend on their own militaries will come by the end of 2020 , not that it happened ""last year.""

Democrats and borders

As usual, Trump claimed of Democrats, ""They want open borders.""

Facts First: Even 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests.

Here are some claims we can't definitively call false at the moment but are either dubious or require more context:

Facebook and the election

Trump appeared to refer to a flawed study that dubiously alleged that Google bias was sufficiently bad to have shifted at least 2.6 million votes away from Trump in the 2016 presidential election -- except he said somebody had found he lost two million votes or more ""because of Facebook.""

Facts First: The study in question was about Google in particular. While the author, Robert Epstein, did criticize Facebook in congressional The study in question was about Google in particular. While the author, Robert Epstein, did criticize Facebook in congressional testimony in July, he did not find that Facebook cost Trump 2 million votes.

Trump was vague here, saying that ""somebody"" said he had lost 2 million votes or more, so it is possible he was referring to something else. Regardless, there is no evidence for Trump's repeated claim that he was robbed of millions of votes in some manner or another.

The Kurds and ISIS prisoners

Trump expressed his hope that ISIS prisoners in Syria will continue to be guarded, accusing the Kurds of having ""opened up a couple doors to make us look as bad as possible"" and to ""create more havoc.""

Facts First: US officials : US officials told CNN last week that the Kurds have not intentionally released ISIS prisoners to embarrass the US. In a statement to Foreign Policy, the political wing of the Syrian Democratic Forces also denied having done so.

The SDF has had to remove troops guarding prisons and camps holding ISIS fighters and those displaced by the fight against ISIS.

""We already did not have professional jails or professional prisons to keep those prisoners in,"" SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said. ""The Turkish invasion to our region is going to leave a huge space, because we are forced to pull out some of our troops from the prisons and from the (displaced people) camps to the border to protect our people.""

Since it's at least possible Trump was referring to intelligence information not known to the public, we won't flatly declare that the claim isn't true. But no evidence has emerged to suggest it is.

Ammunition levels

Trump repeated a story he has been telling over the last week about the condition of the military early in his presidency.

""When I was thinking about having to do something,"" he said, ""one of our generals came in to see me and said, 'Sir, we don't have ammunition.' I said, 'That's a terrible thing you just said.' He said, 'We don't have ammunition.'""

Facts First: We can't be sure what a general might have privately told Trump, so we'll give Trump leeway to recount this supposed story without repeating the claim in his own words, but it's clearly not true that the world's most powerful military didn't have ammunition, period, when he was inaugurated in January 2017.

However, there are some real facts underlying the dubious tale. The US did have a shortage of certain precision-guided bombs at the time, according to military officials. You can read our full fact check here

The WTO decision

Trump took credit for a World Trade Organization decision to give the US permission to impose $7.5 billion in tariffs on European products in response to European subsidies to airplane manufacturer Airbus.

""Nobody else but me would have gotten that $7.5 billion back for the taxpayers of the United States,"" Trump said."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) would not deny Tuesday that her plan for “Medicare for All” raised taxes on the middle class — even as she did everything she could to avoid confirming it.

A CNN panel in the spin room after the fourth Democrat debate on Tuesday night in Columbus, Ohio, struggled to pin Warren down on the question of whether her policy would raise middle class taxes.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), the author of the bill Warren backs, has admitted openly that middle class Americans would pay higher taxes under his (and her) plan, but argues that middle class families would save money overall because their health insurance costs would supposedly fall.

But Warren has dodged the question in debate after debate, and interview after interview — and did so again when confronted by her opponents in the debate.

In the spin room after the debate, CNN’s anchors and political pundits struggled to extract an answer from Warren. Jake Tapper tried to help her craft an answer that would admit the tax hike, but argue for lower overall costs; John King pointed out, sympathetically, that Warren ran the risk of being accused of lying to the public.

Warren replied, over and over again: “My commitment is I will not sign a bill into law that raises costs on middle class families.”

David Axelrod, former White House adviser to President Barack Obama during the Obamacare fight, was incredulous at Warren’s claim that she knew with certainty that “Medicare for All” would not result in higher overall costs for any middle class family. “How can you even make an assurance as to how all this is going to pencil out?”

Warren stuck to her talking point, refusing to admit she would raise taxes — but declining to deny she would, either.

On March 26, Warren only had six percent support in the poll compared to Sanders’ 33 percent.

The “gender gap” on the two candidates is hitting an “all-time high,” according to College Pulse. Among female college students, Warren leads 34 percent to 27 percent, while Sanders leads among male college students with 31 percent to Warren’s 21 percent.

No other candidate comes close to Warren or Sanders, with Joe Biden (D) falling to a distant third with just ten percent support among Democrat and Democrat-leaning college students– a long fall from the 22 percent he garnered in March.

Andrew Yang (D) falls closely behind Biden with nine percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), Beto O’Rourke (D), and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), with seven percent, four percent, and three percent, respectively. The margin of error was not immediately available.

Harris’s three percent support marks an “all-time low” for the candidate,” College Pulse assessed.

The poll also found that the majority of college students, 54 percent, have an unfavorable view of Biden. Only 45 percent have a favorable view of the former vice president, whose role in the questionable foreign business dealings of his son has been a topic of controversy in recent weeks.

The vast majority of Democrat and Democrat-leaning college students, 89 percent, have a favorable view of Warren and Sanders, the survey showed."

“I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people, and all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said ‘don’t even try because you will never get it passed,’” Warren recalled of her plans for the CFPB, a government agency responsible for consumer protection in the financial sector that was formed in 2011. “We need to get out there and fight for the things that touch people’s lives,” the senator added.

Biden then blurted out: “I agreed with the great job she did!”

The former vice president then raised his voice as he explained how he secured votes in Congress to establish the agency.

“I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So, let’s get those things straight too,” Biden said.

“I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law,” Warren replied softly, prompting laughter from both Biden and debate attendees.

“I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law, but understand—,” she continued.

Biden then interrupted Warren with a compliment, stating: “You did a hell of a job in your job.”

“Thank you,” the Massachusetts Democrat simply replied."

“Look I don’t have a beef with billionaires,” Warren said during the debate, alluding to her previously held position that successful billionaires did not build their wealth on their own.

“My problem is, you made a fortune in America, you had a great idea, you got out there and worked for it, good for you. But you built that fortune in America – I guarantee – you built it in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate,” Warren said.

“You built it in part getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You built it at least in part by protected by police and firefighters all of us help pay the salaries for,” she continued.

“All I’m saying is, you make it to the top of one-tenth of one percent, then pitch in the two cents so every other kid in America has the chance,” she added.

Warren’s claim – that she does not have a “beef” with billionaires – is contradicted by the statements she has made over the course of her presidential campaign, targeting the wealthy specifically.

“Are you telling me that billionaires aren’t in favor of my being president of the United States? I’m shocked!” Warren boasted over the summer:

That is not the only instance. Warren also touted an “ultra-millionaire tax” earlier this year:

We're the richest nation in the history of the world. But the wealthy and the well-connected rig the system to benefit themselves. An #UltraMillionaireTax on the wealthiest 0.1% of Americans would level the playing field for everyone. https://t.co/KRTl33e90K — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) March 29, 2019

The rich & powerful run Washington. Here’s one benefit they wrote for themselves: After making a killing from the economy they’ve rigged, they don't pay taxes on that accumulated wealth. It’s a system that’s rigged for the top if I ever saw one. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 24, 2019

What's “ridiculous” is billionaires who think they can buy the presidency to keep the system rigged for themselves while opportunity slips away for everyone else. The top 0.1%, who'd pay my #UltraMillionaireTax, own about the same wealth as 90% of America. It's time for change. https://t.co/D04G5fNvpa — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 29, 2019

This is far from the first time Warren has insisted that the rich did not build their wealth on their own.

“I’m not proposing a wealth tax because I’m cranky. Some of these guys say, ‘I worked hard. I had a great idea. I worked late’– oh yeah, unlike anybody else,” the presidential hopeful sarcastically stated during a campaign stop in Hampton Falls, New Hampshire, on Labor Day. “But ‘I worked late or inherited wealth, and so this is mine.’”

“And the answer is yeah, you did. Good for you. You did have a great idea and you did work hard. No one is angry about that, but here’s the deal. You built a great fortune here in America. I guarantee you built it at least in part using workers all of us help pay to educate,” she continued.

“Yeah. You built it at least in part, getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped pay to build. Yep. You built it at least in part, protected by police and firefighters all of us help pay their salaries,” she added.

Warren’s relationship with the ultra-wealthy has been convoluted over the years. Although she has targeted millionaires and billionaires over the course of her presidential campaign, she has received money from at least 30 billionaires over the course of her political career."

“As usual Senator Warren is 100% wrong in diagnosing the problem, there absolutely [are] excesses in technology and in some cases having them divest parts of their business is the right move,” conceded Yang.

“But we also have to be realistic that competition doesn’t solve all the problems.”

“It’s not like any of us want to use the fourth-best navigation app… There’s a reason why nobody is using Bing today. Sorry Microsoft, it’s true!”

“It’s not like breaking up these tech companies will revive mainstream businesses around the country.”

“And as the parent of two young children, I’m particularly concerned about screen use and its effect on our children. Studies clearly show that we’re seeing record levels of anxiety and depression coincident with smartphone adoption and social media use.”

“Breaking up the tech companies does nothing to make our kids healthier. What we have to do is we have to hone in on the specific problems we’re trying to solve and use 21st-century solutions for 21st-century problems. Using a 20th-century antitrust framework will not work. We need new solutions and a new toolkit.”

Elizabeth Warren responded to Yang’s remarks, stating “I’m not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy. It’s time to fight back.”

She went on to slam Amazon for its domination of America’s retail market, and the way it crowds out competition from small businesses.

“Think about it this way — when you talk about it this way when you talk about how it works, and competition. About eight percent [to] nine percent of retail sales in bricks and sticks stores happen at Walmart. About 49 percent of all sales online happen in one place — that’s Amazon. It collects information from every little business. And then Amazon does something else — it runs the platform, gets all the information, and then goes into competition with those little businesses.”

“You get to be the umpire in the baseball or you get to be a team, but you don’t get to do both at the same time. We need to enforce our antitrust laws, break up these giant companies that are dominating big tech, big pharma, big oil — all of them.”

Whereas Tulsi Gabbard has been consistent on the question of censorship, criticizing big tech companies for “throwing free speech out the window,” Warren has flip-flopped on the issue. She condemned Facebook for its power to “shut down debate” after it removed an ad for her campaign in March this year, but a few months later called for tech companies to censor criticism of Kamala Harris.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) subtly reminisced her days as a registered Republican. She answered a question about a “surprise” friendship that impacted her and her beliefs by talking about her relationship with “deeply principled Republican” Charles Fried — who served as Solicitor General from 1985-1989 — and her three brothers, two of whom are Republicans.

Candidates at the Ohio Democrat debate on Tuesday were asked, “What friendship have you had that would surprise us, and what impact has it had on you and your beliefs?”

“Twenty-seven years ago, when I was under consideration for a job,” Warren began, mentioning Fried, whom she described as “a deeply principled Republican.”

“We didn’t agree on much. I was far more liberal than he was,” Warren said.

Notably, Warren was a registered Republican 27 years ago. She did not change her party affiliation to Democrat until 1996.

“But he also was willing to listen to my work about what’s happening to America’s middle class, and Charles engaged with it over and over and ultimately is the person who made sure that I got the job,” Warren continued before pivoting to her Republican brothers.

“You know, I grew up out in Oklahoma. I have three older brothers. They all served in the military. Two of the three are still Republicans. I love all three of my brothers. And there are a lot of things that we’re divided on, but there are core things that we believe in together,” the presidential hopeful said.

She continued:

We want to see all of our children get a good start in life. We don’t want to see any of our friends or neighbors not get covered by health care. We’re willing to get out there for the things we believe in. Look, people across this country — whether they’re Democrats, independents, or Republicans — they know what’s broken. They know that we have an America that’s working better and better and better for a thinner and thinner and thinner slice at the top and leaving everyone else behind. People across this country, regardless of party, are ready to say, “No more. We want an America that works for everyone.”

“2020 is our moment in history. It’s a deep honor to be here to be in this fight. I know what’s broken. I know how to fix it, and we are building a grassroots movement to get it done that includes everyone,” she concluded."

However, the conflict in Yemen — which the Obama administration first began supporting Saudi Arabia in fighting — is a far bigger humanitarian crisis.

Trump this week withdrew about 1,000 U.S. forces from northern Syria in the face of an oncoming Turkish invasion into northern Syria.

Democrats accused the president of abandoning a U.S. ally, since U.S. forces fought alongside Syrian Democratic Forces to help defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in Syria.

According to Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, there have been 250,000 displaced by Turkey’s invasion, and at least 71 civilians killed since the beginning of the invasion.

However, the continuing conflict in Yemen — which the Obama administration first began supplying Saudi Arabia military support for — is a far bigger humanitarian crisis.

There are between one million to two million Kurds in Syria, according to the New York Times.

However, there are more than ten times the number of Yemenis who are in need of humanitarian assistance.

Approximately 24 million Yemenis — about 80 percent of the population — are in need of humanitarian assistance from the Saudi-led war in Yemen against the Iran-backed Houthis, and millions more have been displaced by the fighting in Yemen, according to the Voice of America.

The United Nations has called the crisis in Yemen “the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.”

The UN estimates that about 10 children die per day in Yemen from diseases caused by hunger, and there has been an outbreak of cholera resulting in more than a million cases and about 3,000 deaths since the fighting began in 2014.

Save the Children estimates that 85,000 Yemeni children under the age of 5 may have died of starvation.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) suggested that politicians cannot pretend to take on Big Tech and big pharmaceutical corporations after taking their donations — something Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) has continued to do throughout her run for president.

After Harris demanded that tech corporations like Twitter ban President Trump from their platforms, Warren touted that she, unlike Harris, has refused to take donations from Big Tech and Big Pharma.

Harris, despite claiming that she will fight Big Tech and Big Pharma companies if elected, has taken donor money from employees of the country’s biggest tech conglomerates and pharmaceutical executives, as Breitbart News has detailed.

In fact, Harris’s campaign has been almost exclusively propped up by a base of elite coastal donors with less than 40 percent of her funding coming from small-dollar donors giving $200 or less. The majority of Harris’s donations, more than 56 percent, have come from large-dollar donors giving $200 or more.

Harris’s top donors include lawyers from the Paul, Weiss, et al. law firm, which has represented Citigroup, as well as American job outsourcers and offshorers such as the Walt Disney Company; multinational communications services AT&T; Alphabet Inc., which is the parent corporation of Google; as well as Apple Inc.

In May, billionaire Gordon Getty of the Getty Oil dynasty hosted a fundraiser for Harris at his mansion in San Francisco, California, with Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA). Campaign records find that the billionaire Getty family has contributed thousands to Harris.

Likewise, though Harris’s campaign has claimed that she does not accept funding from Big Pharma, a number of pharmaceutical executives have gifted the California senator with campaign cash, The Intercept notes:

Donors include Therese Meaney, a vice president at Endo Pharmaceuticals, a company that manufacturers opioid painkillers, who has given $1,250 to the Harris campaign; Ted Love, the president and chief executive of Global Blood Therapeutics, a startup biopharmaceutical company, who gave $2,800; J. Dana Hughes, a vice president at Pfizer, gave $250; Damian Wilmot, an executive at Vertex Pharmaceuticals, gave $1,000; and Jeffrey Stein, the chief executive of Cidara Therapeutics, another drug startup, who gave $1,000.

Silicon Valley’s tech elites have been major contributors to Harris’s bid as she has campaigned against slapping tariffs on the foreign-made products of tech corporations.

Seven Facebook executives and employees have donated $1,000 or more to Harris’s campaign, while nearly 20 Google executives and employees have donated more than $1,000, four Twitter executives and employees have donated more than $1,000, and 71 Amazon executives and employees have donated anywhere from $5 to $2,000.

The Walt Disney Company’s Craig Hunegs, who heads Disney Television Studios, is one of Harris’s top donors, giving nearly $6,000 to her campaign. California real estate developer John Dinapoli, Coastal Healthcare Services President Quiana Mitchem, and New York Attorney Fraser Hunter Jr. have all donated more than $5,000 to Harris as well.

“At least Bernie’s being honest here in saying how he’s going to pay for this. Taxes are going to go up,” Klobuchar said. “I think we owe it to the American people as to where we send the invoice.”

Klobuchar explained to Warren that a public option is necessary to bring down healthcare premium costs of those covered and said that Warren’s plan fails to do that.

“The boldest idea here is not to trash Obamacare but to do what Obama wanted to do from the beginning, and that’s have a public option to bring down the cost of the premium and expand the cost of the covered and take on the pharmaceutical companies,” she said. “That is what we should be doing instead of kick 149 million people off their insurance in four years.”

“I appreciate Elizabeth’s work, but the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done,” she added.

Earlier in the debate, Warren was asked a yes or no question as to whether she would raise healthcare costs in her Medicare for All plan. She responded that costs will go up for the rich and down for those who are not.

So the story from Biden goes, gangster “Corn Pop” represented a serious threat to Biden when he was a lifeguard at a community pool. Corn Pop, who actually was real, supposedly carried a straight razor and after an altercation with young lifeguard Biden threatened to meet him in the parking lot later—so young Biden claims he threatened to wrap a chain around Corn Pop’s head.

The whole blowup was over Biden allegedly calling Corn Pop “Esther,” a derisive insult drawn from the swimmer Esther Williams that apparently was akin to calling the gangster a girl. But before things devolved into a razor-versus-chain race war in the parking lot later, Biden says he apologized to Corn Pop for the insult, which defused the situation—and the incident has become part of Biden’s political folklore storyline of being a grand negotiator who can calmly lead in tense political situations, especially those involving race.

Though it seems an incredible story, Biden included it in his 2007 autobiography and it was a central part of a dedication ceremony at a Delaware public pool at which Biden spoke in 2017. The NAACP even confirmed the details of Corn Pop and his existence for those questioning it.

So when moderator Anderson Cooper at the end of the CNN-New York Times debate on Tuesday night closed down the debate with a question about a unique and different friendship that has shaped their lives, one would have thought the moderators were teeing Biden up for a perfect Corn Pop moment.

Cooper said:

Last week, Ellen DeGeneres was criticized after she and former President George W. Bush were seen laughing together at a football game. Ellen defended their friendship, saying, we’re all different and I think that we’ve forgotten that that’s OK that we’re all different. So in that spirit, we’d like you to tell us about a friendship that you’ve had that would surprise us and what impact it’s had on you and your beliefs.

Cooper went to all 11 other candidates before getting to Biden, who closed it down at the end, giving Biden plenty of time to think about what he was going to say.

Instead of telling the story of Corn Pop, Biden opted for a more conventional and boring answer, and one already used by several of the other candidates: He talked about his friendship with the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ):

This is reassuring in the fact that we’re all acknowledging that we have to reach across the aisle, get things done. No other way to get anything done in this country. The two people maybe would surprise you the most were — he’s been mentioned twice, but John McCain. John McCain worked for me when he worked in the Navy, and he was — he was my assigned to me to travel around the world. We became close friends. He became very close friends with my wife, Jill. Visited our home. He was there with his children. And on his death bed, he asked me to do his eulogy. John, I would say to John, ‘John, you didn’t see a war you never wanted to fight.’ And he’d say, ‘You didn’t see a problem you never wanted to solve.’ But he was a great man of principle. He was honorable. He was honorable.

Biden finished with typical talking points from his stump speech about why he’s running for president—nothing remarkable, nothing outstanding, and nothing memorable.

Some pundits and observers on Twitter laughed about Biden leaving Corn Pop hanging in favor of the safer McCain story, mocking Biden for being unable to read the room.

Harris: Rand

Bernie: McCain

Missed opportunity to invoke Corn Pop — Ellen McGirt (@ellmcgirt) October 16, 2019

While this is more of a lighthearted ribbing of Biden, in an unserious and comedic manner—Corn Pop probably was not the right story anyway for the question—it does illustrate a larger problem with the sliding campaign of the former Vice President.

He again had no major memorable positive moments on a crowded debate stage for the fourth month in a row. Donald Trump, Jr., President Donald Trump’s eldest son, mocked Biden’s lackluster performance in a tweet by noting that, at least this time in the Ohio debate, Biden’s teeth didn’t nearly fall out—as they almost did in the previous debate.

On the bright side, at least Joe’s teeth didn’t fall out this time! — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 16, 2019

It seems cruel, but Biden’s teeth did slip and nearly fall out of his mouth in a previous debate, and in a forum his eye exploded, bleeding on live television. Another candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), suffered a heart attack less than two weeks before this debate, pushing health questions–like whether any of these Democrats are actually healthy enough to run for and serve as president–to the forefront of Americans’ minds heading into Tuesday night. Moderators even asked several of the candidates about these concerns in Ohio’s debate.

This all comes as it has been revealed by just-released Federal Election Commission (FEC) campaign finance reports that Biden’s campaign spent more than he raised in funds last quarter, and he keeps slipping in polls behind rivals Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and now lags in the fundraising race as well.

The bigger story that broke during the debate news cycle in its immediate aftermath is Biden spent nearly $2 million more than he raised last quarter—he raised $15.7 million and spent $17.6 million—while he had less than $9 million cash on hand at the end of September. That puts him at less than Sanders’ $33.7 million, less than Warren’s $25.7 million, less than Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s $23.4 million, and even less than the $10.5 million that the flaming-out Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) had.

NEWS: Joe Biden has $8.98 million cash on hand Sanders: $33.7 million

Warren: $25.7 million

Buttigieg: $23.4 million

Harris: $10.5 million — Shane Goldmacher (@ShaneGoldmacher) October 16, 2019

At a burn rate like Biden’s running, with not much gas in the tank, the former Vice President could be in some serious trouble in attempting to remain near the front of the pack. He’s already lost his frontrunner status, as Warren has pulled ahead of him in most national polling and in almost every early and battleground state except in the South. CNN’s Chris Cillizza called Biden’s funding lapses a “bombshell” revelation multiple times in a post about the matter, writing that it represents a “SIREN” for Biden’s campaign.

Factor that together with burgeoning attacks on his son Hunter Biden’s business dealings from the White House and President Donald Trump, as well as a media beginning to be receptive to the criticisms, and Joe Biden has a tougher-than-ever road ahead. Hunter Biden’s interview earlier on Tuesday on ABC did his father no favors by most accounts, and even CNN and JournoList founder Ezra Klein of Vox are now saying there is something to all the questions swirling around him and that Democrats need to be prepared to deal with this.

CNN published a fact check after the debate contrasting Biden’s claims he never discussed Hunter’s business dealings with his son with Hunter’s claims he did discuss them with his father.

Klein, meanwhile, laid out in a Vox article how Democrats are woefully unprepared on the Hunter Biden issue should Joe Biden win the nomination, urging Democrats to learn how to talk about it, even if they don’t want to discuss the problems. Klein wrote:

A few things are true about the Hunter Biden story. One is that there’s no evidence Joe Biden did what Donald Trump has accused him of doing: pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor to protect his son from investigation. But another is that Hunter Biden poses real problems for Joe Biden’s campaign, and if Democrats pretend otherwise, they’re making a mistake. Many Democrats consider raising the Hunter Biden question unfair to Joe Biden. Why should he have to answer for the legal actions of his adult son? But no one said politics was fair. And if Democrats avoid the issue, they can be certain Trump will not. Biden’s vulnerability here needs to be tested in the primary, when Democrats have other choices, rather than in the general, when they won’t.

The debate moderators and other candidates barely touched on Hunter Biden during the debate, and only to brush it aside as a non-concern. But Hunter Biden is hardly the only of Joe Biden’s problems after the debate on Tuesday.

There was a particularly memorable moment where, towards the end of the night, both Sanders and Warren extracted a pound of flesh from Biden from the left—significantly undermining his standing with Democrats.

Cooper asked Biden to respond to the broad visions of big, bold change that Warren and Sanders respectively have been laying out:

Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change. Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution. Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump?

Biden replied with a claim he is the only one who has gotten anything substantive actually “done” in Washington:

Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people, and I think a lot of what they have to say is really important. But, you know, Senator Warren said we can’t be running any vague campaigns. We’ve got to level with people. We’ve got to level with people and tell them exactly what we’re going to do, how we’re going to get it done, and if you can get it done. I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done, from the Violence Against Women Act to making sure that we pass the Affordable Care Act to being in a position where we, in fact, took almost a $90 billion act that kept us from going into a depression, making us — putting us in a position where I was able to end roe — excuse me, able to end the issue of gun sales in terms of assault weapons. And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who is going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how you’re going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade.

After a follow-up question from Cooper asking Biden to further specify exactly whom he said was being “vague,” he took a not-so-veiled shot at the Medicare-for-All vision put forward by Warren and Sanders.

Biden said:

Well, the senator said — she’s being vague on the issue of — actually, both are being vague on the issue of Medicare for all. No, look, here’s the deal. Come on. It costs $30 trillion. Guess what? That’s over $3 trillion — it’s more than the entire federal budget… If you eliminated the entire Pentagon, every single thing, plane, ship, troop, the buildings, everything, satellites, it would get you — it would pay for a total of four months. Four months. Where do you get the rest? Where does it come from?

That opened Sanders up to decimate Biden for “working with Republicans” to back endless wars in the Middle East and trade policies that hurt America’s working class:

Joe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what you also got done? And I say this as a good friend. You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA and PNTR, with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs. Now, let’s get to Medicare for all. Let’s be honest. We spend twice as much per person as do the people of any other major country on Earth. And the answer is, if we have the guts that I would like to see the Democratic Party have that guts, to stand up to the drug companies and the insurance companies and tell them that the function of health care is to guarantee care to all people, not to make $100 billion in profit.

After back-and-forth between Biden and Sanders in response to Sanders’ smack-down, Warren delivered another brutal blow to Biden. Warren’s reply focused on the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, with which she was intricately involved and for which she receives enormous credit among Democrats:

So you started this question with how you got something done. You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, don’t even try, because you will never get it passed. And sure enough, the big banks fought us. The Republicans fought us. Some of the Democrats fought us. But we got that agency passed into law. It has now forced big banks to return more than $12 billion directly to people they cheated. I served in the Obama administration. I know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it. In Congress, on the first day, I will pass my anti-corruption bill, which will beat back the influence of money and repeal the filibuster. And the third, we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight for the things that touch people’s lives.

Buttigieg, who had sparred all night with Warren, seemed to sense what was coming next for Biden and attempted to interrupt to spare the former vice president any more pain from the socialists on either side of him. But Biden didn’t take the life raft from South Bend’s mayor, opting instead to further engage with Warren on the 2008 financial crisis. Biden, after fighting the moderators to respond to Warren, attempted to take credit for whipping U.S. Senate votes for the legislation that created the CFPB.

“I agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes,” Biden said. “I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight, too.”

Big mistake for Biden, as evidenced by the leftists on Twitter ripping him for “yelling” at Warren, lecturing the former college professor on her subject of expertise and claiming she couldn’t have done it without his work whipping votes for her project.

The fight over the CFPB was my daily beat for basically a year. I don't remember Joe Biden being involved whatsoever. His adviser Jared Bernstein was a strong supporter but Biden was 100% AWOL.

The fact that Biden yelled at Warren, “I got you the votes!” speaks to everything we know about peak white male fragility. #DemDebate — Preston Mitchum (@PrestonMitchum) October 16, 2019

That set Warren up for the line of the night, when Cooper gave the spotlight back to her to reply to Biden.

“I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law,” Warren said.

Holy crap, Elizabeth Warren responds with Joe Biden snapping at her about his role in getting votes for the CFPB by thanking Obama. Whoosh.#DemocraticDebatepic.twitter.com/dAOtNuLvAL — Erick Fernandez (@ErickFernandez) October 16, 2019

Warren thanking former President Barack Obama, but not Biden, was brutal to Biden. Obama has not endorsed his former vice president in the 2020 Democrat presidential primary, deliberately not supporting his one-time wingman. That void for Biden and lack of support from the Democrats’ most popular star, the former president—despite Biden’s best efforts to closely associate himself with Obama at every turn—cuts like a dagger into his support.

It raises all sorts of questions among Democrats, including most importantly about Biden’s electability, about why they should vote for Biden if Obama won’t even endorse and campaign with him. Making matters worse for Biden is that, the morning after this debate, Obama turned around and endorsed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s re-election north of the border—but still refuses to back his own former right-hand guy.

I was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President. He's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term. — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) October 16, 2019

“You did a hell of a job in your job,” Biden interrupted Warren’s answer.

“Thank you,” Warren coolly replied to laughter from the audience. She continued:

But understand this. It was a dream big, fight hard. People told me, go for something little, go for something small, go for something that the big corporations will be able to accept. I said, no, let’s go for an agency that will make structural change in our economy.

“And President Obama said, I will fight for that, and he sometimes had to fight against people in his own administration,” Warren continued before Biden interrupted her again.

“Not me!” Biden protested, as Warren refused to credit him with any involvement in the response to the financial crisis.

Warren kept plowing through her answer, ignoring Biden’s protests.

“We have to be willing to make good, big, structural change,” she said.

By Wednesday, Biden seems to have realized just how bad Tuesday’s debate was for his campaign, as before he even left Ohio he was out ripping Sanders and Warren to anyone in the press who would listen, accusing them of “playing Trump’s game and trying to con the American people.”

He ripped Sanders and Warren for not being able to explain how they would pay for their mass increases in government benefits and claimed both were disingenuous.

Meanwhile, the establishment media keeps playing up Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) as candidates they say had big nights, as Democrats desperately look for someone to be able to effectively counter Warren’s and Sanders’ socialist vision—all while establishment-favorite blasts from the past like former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the 2016 Democrat nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton are discussed as potential Democrat saviors from the leftist socialist abyss."

The lack of questions on immigration to 2020 Democrats comes as swing voters are increasingly turned off by the candidates’ plans to bring millions of more foreign workers to the U.S.

Polling from Harvard/Harris reveals among all U.S. voters, and particularly with swing voters, that presidential candidates campaigning for immigration, illegal and legal, is the most unpopular policy position.

Amy Klobuchar (D-MN); and South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg — did well in the fourth Democrat debate on Tuesday evening.

However, even the “moderate” candidates support radical policies — such as extreme tax hikes, for example.

The moderators asked several candidates whether they would support a “wealth tax” — a tax on what Americans have saved after already paying other taxes, such as income taxes. (Neither CNN nor the New York Times hosts pointed to any authorization in the U.S. Constitution for a tax on wealth. The Sixteenth Amendment was needed merely to authorize taxes on income; a wealth tax is a direct tax not apportioned by state, and therefore illegal.

Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), recognized as the leaders in the “progressive” lane, have both proposed wealth taxes. But on Tuesday, so did most of the “moderate” candidates on the debate stage.

Buttigieg declared: “I’m all for a wealth tax.” Klobuchar answered: “I am open to it. It could work.”

Only Biden opposed it — but he pushed for a doubling of the capital gains tax, to 39.5% — which would make the U.S. tax rate on investments one of the highest in the world, pushing money offshore to less punitive countries.

It was left to Andrew Yang to point out that wealth taxes had failed everywhere: “It’s been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all those countries ended up repealing it because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue projected.

“We should not be looking to other countries’ mistakes,” Yang added.

Tulsi Gabbard’s (D-HI) pointed attack on Harris’s controversial prosecutorial record – jailing hundreds of people for marijuana violations and later making light of smoking marijuana – during the Democrat debate in July.

Harris signaled a switch in campaign strategies in September, telling a colleague that she is “f*cking moving to Iowa.”

“‘I’m f*cking moving to Iowa’ – Kamala Harris,” read an email following the presidential hopeful’s quip.

“She cut to the chase!” the email stated. “We’re doubling our organizers on the ground in Iowa and Kamala is ramping up her time on the trail there, beginning today in Cedar Rapids.”

The following month, Harris launched her “I feel your pain” tour across Iowa, which featured the presidential hopeful speaking to Iowans in more “intimate” settings, even helping some “prepare Sunday suppers.”

Despite the Iowa push, Harris continues to tank in the polls, with the latest Emerson Polling survey showing Harris garnering just two percent among Democrat caucus-goers in Iowa.

The poll, taken October 13-16, 2019 among 313 Democrat caucus voters, showed Joe Biden (D) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) topping the field with 23 percent support each. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) overtook Sanders for third place with 16 percent support to the Vermont senator’s 13 percent.

Andrew Yang (D) came in fifth place with five percent support, followed by Gov. Steve Bullock (D) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with four percent and three percent, respectively.

Harris, who once mocked Gabbard’s low poll numbers, tied with both the Hawaiian lawmaker and Tom Steyer (D), with two percent support. The margin of error is +/- 5.5 percent:

Harris mocked Gabbard following their contentious face-off in July’s debate, telling CNN’s Anderson Cooper:

This is going to sound immodest, but I’m obviously a top tier candidate, and so, I did expect that I would be on the stage and take hits tonight because there are a lot of people that are trying to make the stage for the next debate.

“Especially when people are at zero or one percent or whatever she might be at, and so, I did expect that I might take hits tonight,” she added, a direct reference to Gabbard:

Harris continues to struggle in national polls, dropping to fifth place with 5.2 percent in the current Real Clear Politics average, behind Biden, Warren, Sanders, and Buttigieg."

Cummings had not returned to work due to an unnamed medical procedure and had not participated in a roll call vote since September 11, according to the Baltimore Sun.

Tributes have been pouring in on social media, and several of the 2020 Democrat candidates remarked on the lawmaker’s unexpected passing.

The Washington Post stated Tuesday that Ocasio-Cortez is expected to announce her support for Sanders’s White House bid alongside the senator on Saturday at his first rally since suffering a heart attack two weeks ago.

“We’re looking forward to Saturday,” Ocasio-Cortez spokesperson Corbin Trent teased in a statement.

During tonight’s CNN-New York Times’ Democrat presidential debate, Sanders teased that he would have a “special guest” at his “Bernie’s back” rally in Queens, New York.

“The endorsement could be a blow for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who, like Sanders, is running on a platform of sweeping liberal change and who has emphasized her role as a female pioneer,” notes the Post.

Ocasio-Cortez worked as a volunteer organizer for Sanders’s 2016 campaign.

The development comes after Sanders said that he “misspoke” when he told reporters he may slow his frenetic campaigning pace after a recent heart attack.

The Vermont senator backtracked in an interview with NBC News just a day after indicating that health concerns would force him to change “the nature” of his campaign, in the short term, at least.

“We’re going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign,” Sanders told NBC, downplaying the impact of the heat attack, which required him to be rushed to the hospital where he received two stents to clear a clogged artery in his heart.

“People should think that I had a procedure which hundreds of thousands of people a year have,” Sanders continued. “People should think that according to the doctors I’m on the way to a full recovery.”

The 78-year-old self-described democratic socialist was hospitalized after experiencing chest discomfort while campaigning in Las Vegas last week. His staff initially said the stents were inserted for a blocked artery, revealing only two days later that he had had a heart attack.

Sanders told NBC it was “nonsense” to suggest his staff hadn’t been forthright about his condition. He said he was still talking to doctors and trying to understand what was going on.

2. Bernie Sanders as Putin?

Biden also unexpectedly gestured at Bernie Sanders when referring to Vladimir Putin.

“Excuse me,” Bernie Sanders interupted, “Vladimir Putin, here?”

3. Which son?

Biden defended his son Hunter Biden serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company but failed to differentiate him from his deceased son Beau Biden, who was the Attorney General of Delaware.

“Even when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware, we never discussed anything so that there would be no potential conflict,” he said, without naming Beau.

5. Ending Roe vs. Wade?

Biden also stumbled when saying he was “put in the position of ending Roe vs. Wade” before correcting himself to talk about gun sales.

6. Biden vague on the issue of being vague

Biden criticized his Democrat rival Elizabeth Warren for being vague, but ended up sounding more vague in the process. “Part of that requires you not being vague,” Biden said. When asked to explain what he meant, he meandered on for several seconds talking about the different costs of healthcare.

7. Age is wisdom

When asked about his age, Biden said that his advanced age gave him “wisdom” to be president.

“One of the reasons I’m running is because of my age and my experience,” he said. “With it comes wisdom. We need someone to take office this time around who on day one can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders.”

Biden struggled throughout the night to demonstrate that his advanced age made him more qualified to be president than any of the younger candidates."

The segment began when CNN host Anderson Cooper asked Biden about an interview that Hunter Biden gave to ABC on Tuesday where he admitted he “made a mistake and showed poor judgment” by accepting a position on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.

“My son did nothing wrong,” Biden declared. “I did nothing wrong.”

He explained:

“Look, the fact that George Washington on the first time he spoke after being elected, that we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections, it was the greatest threat to America. This president on three occasions, three occasions, has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous. Rudy Giuliani, the president and his thugs have already proven that they, in fact, are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn’t want me to be the candidate. He is going after me because he knows if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.”

In his attempt to recap Biden’s meandering answer, Noah said that he understood what Biden meant but that it “took a while for him to get there.”

“OK, one minute he’s talking about his son, then George Washington, then something about the seventeenth?” the Comedy Central host remarked. “Joe Biden is the only candidate who remixes his speech while he’s giving it.”

After mocking the number of candidates on the debate stage, Noah also described the “weirdest part of the night” as when Kamala Harris (D-CA) “started a real-life Twitter beef” with Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) over Twitter’s refusal to ban Trump from its platform.

“I’ll be honest, I kind of understand Warren’s point here,” he explained. “We need Trump on Twitter. It’s the only way we can monitor what he’s up to. Otherwise, he’s doing that shit in secret. You’ve got to think of Twitter as a presidential baby monitor. The whole time you’re looking, you’re like, ‘Hold on, he’s awake and wants to nuke a hurricane, I gotta go!’”

Tuesday’s debate was the fourth this year among those Democrats angling to win their party’s presidential nomination, and the ratings were the lowest of the year, even when you add the 449,000 live streams.

Back in July, far-left CNN hosted the second debate of the year, a two-night event that drew 8.7 million and 10.7 million viewers, for an average of 9.7 million. This was also a massive drop-off from the previous debate.

In June, the first Democrat debate of the year, hosted by NBC, MSNBC, and Telemundo, drew 15.3 million viewers on night one and 18.1 million viewers on night two, for an average of 16.7 million.

I supposed you could argue that people are already losing interest in the presidential campaign. But with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) surging into first place against former Vice President Joe Biden, that doesn’t make much sense. There’s a real horse race happening among the Democrats. This is an election in flux where anything can still happen, so I doubt interest is waning.

The problem appears to be … CNNLOL.

The first and third debates were hosted by NBC and ABC, respectively, and garnered gonzo ratings: 16.7 million and 14 million.

The third and fourth debates, hosted by CNNLOL, resulted in a mammoth collapse in viewers, around a 40 percent drop: 8.7 million and 8.3 million.

For those of you who might be under the mistaken belief a cable channel like CNN cannot compete with broadcast outlets like ABC and NBC, that’s just not true.

To begin with, CNN is available in nearly 80 million households. Secondly, during the 2016 presidential campaign, 15.5 million viewers watched the first debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders on CNN.

CNN hosted a Republican debate during the 2016 primary that attracted 23 million viewers.

So, at one time, CNN was able to compete with the broadcast networks. But now Democrat primary voters are turning away in droves whenever one of their debates airs on the far-left cable channel.

CNN must be the problem.

What other explanation is there?

CNN is not only the lowest rated (by far) and least trusted of the cable news networks, it is also staffed by the least interesting anchors in the business. You don’t have to like MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow or Chris Matthews to find them interesting, to see they are real people with minds of their own. But as we are learning through the Project Veritas reporting, everyone at CNN is a Jeff Zucker clone, a puppet repeating his talking points, expressing his far-left beliefs. As a result, the network is now predictable and dull; one note and blah.

CNN has changed A LOT since the 2016 presidential campaign, since the days when it could actually compete with Fox News and the broadcast network for debate viewers, even Republican debate viewers.

But since Trump’s election, CNN has worked overtime to whore out its credibility, and has done so just because the fake news outlet is too immature to accept the results of the 2016 presidential election. And in doing so, CNN has allowed Zucker to cast a gray pall over the entire enterprise, which makes it lifeless, tedious, and boring.

If Democrats want to attract a serious number of eyeballs, and I’m sure they do, they need to dump CNN as a debate partner.

Janis: Her Life and Music, scheduled to be released Oct. 22, claims that a young Johnson ruthlessly hounded the future singer by making crude sexual remarks, throwing pennies at her, and making fun of her hippie style, according to an early look obtained by The Daily Mail.

Both attended Thomas Jefferson High School in Port Arthur, Texas, during the late 50s. While Johnson was a student athlete who socialized primarily with jocks and cheerleaders, Joplin was more introverted and tended toward the arts.

Johnson would grow up to become a college and NFL coach, serving as head coach for the Cowboys and seeing the team to two Super Bowl victories. He later became head coach for the Miami Dolphins. Johnson currently serves as a commentator for Fox NFL Sunday.

The new book by Holly George-Warren alleges that Johnson nicknamed Joplin “Beat Weeds” in a crude reference to her pubic hair, according to the Mail.

Johnson has admitted on Twitter that he gave her the nickname. He also said that he “kidded” Joplin a lot, and that she was an “odd duck” who wore black leotards.

“@joeirrera: high school classmate of Janis Joplin! Your followers would love some inside info on that.”I gave her Nickname ""Beat Weeds""! — Jimmy Johnson (@JimmyJohnson) April 29, 2012

“@Dustin_Mattison: Your classmate Janis Joplin is 69 today. How well did you know her?”fairly well..kidded her alot — Jimmy Johnson (@JimmyJohnson) January 19, 2012

“@danks231: what was Janis Joplin like in high school?”odd duck..weed..black leotards.. — Jimmy Johnson (@JimmyJohnson) November 26, 2011

The new book claims that Johnson also tried to grope Joplin, along with his friends, and spread rumors that the future singer had slept with their friends.

By Joplin’s senior year, she had become “the image of everything the students disliked,” according to the book.

Janis Joplin rose to fame as a counter-culture icon, performing rock, folk and blues songs to great acclaim. She died at 27 in 1970 of a heroin overdose.

In fact, it’s a point that was popularized by Republicans, including his one-time Senate opponent Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX).

Speaking at the CNN Democrat presidential debate today, Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke echoed a talking point often made by Republican critics of Silicon Valley — that big tech platforms ought to be considered publishers if they are engaged in curating content rather than taking a hands-off approach.

“Right now we treat [big tech platforms] functionally as a utility,” said Rep. O’Rourke, “when in reality they’re more akin to a publisher. They curate the content that we see.”

“Our pictures and personal information that they share with others … We would allow no publisher to do what Facebook is doing, to publish that ad that Senator Warren has rightfully called out, that CNN has refused to air because it is untrue and tells lies about the Vice President.”

“Treat them like the publisher[s] that they are, that is what I will do as President, and we will be unafraid to break up big businesses if we have to do that.”

Congressman O’Rourke is right. Big tech platforms, often due to pressure from his fellow Democrats to pick and choose what content their users see, have moved into the role of content curators and publishers as opposed to neutral platforms in recent years.

This change in policy was acknowledged by Google’s own internal researchers in a document exclusively leaked to Breitbart News called “The Good Censor.” In one section of the document, the researchers acknowledged that Google and other big tech platforms have tilted towards the role of “editor” and “publisher” in their approach to user-generated content.

Other leaks have revealed tech companies using top-down interventions to curate political search results (Google/YouTube), and putting high-profile political figures on a “hate agent” watchlist for potential banning (Facebook). Tech companies have also banned a wide range of political figures and news sources — ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, Facebook banned the pages of over 800 independent news websites.

Facebook has also acknowledged its status as a publisher in two separate court filings, one from November 2018 and one from September 2019.

It has long been the position of many leading Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) that actions like those listed above have made it more appropriate to describe them as publishers rather than neutral platforms.

“If they’re not going to be neutral public forums, if they’re going to be active political speakers, favoring one point of view and disfavoring another, they have a first amendment right to do that, but they have no entitlement to a special congressionally-created immunity from liability that nobody else enjoys,” Sen. Cruz told Breitbart News last year."

Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) wealth tax has failed in other western countries that have tried it.

Yang said he agreed with Warren that we are living in the most “winner-take-all economy in history.”

“And a wealth tax makes a lot of sense in principle,” Yang said. “The problem is it’s been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all those countries ended up repealing it because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they projected.”

“If we can’t learn from the failed experiences of other countries what can we learn from?” Yang said. “We should not be looking to other countries’ mistakes. Instead we should be looking at what Germany, France, Denmark and Sweden still have, which is a Value Added Tax.”

Then Yang suggested those taxes would come from American corporations and other businesses.

“If we give the American people a tiny slice of every Amazon sale, every Google search, every robot truck mile, every Facebook ad we can generate hundreds of billions of dollars and then put it into our hands because we know best how to use it,” Yang said.

National Review reported on the countries that have indeed repealed their wealth tax.

Wealth-tax supporters do not seem concerned about the likely damage to economic growth. But they should know that from a practical standpoint, wealth taxes in other countries have raised little money and have been a beast to administer. More than a dozen European countries used to have wealth taxes, but nearly all of these countries repealed them, including Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Sweden. Wealth taxes survive only in Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. Before repeal, European wealth taxes — with a variety of rates and bases — tended to raise only about 0.2 percent of gross domestic product in revenue, based on Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development data. That is only 1/40th as much as the U.S. federal income tax raises.

Leftist economist and political commentator Robert Reich tweeted about VAT after Yang’s remarks and how it would hurt lower income Americans.

Can we get this straight? A VAT — value added tax — is a sales tax on every stage of production. A sales tax is regressive. It takes a bigger bite from lower-income pay than from higher-income. A VAT is the most regressive system of all. — Robert Reich (@RBReich) October 16, 2019

Some 2020 Democrats have embraced the move to automatically specify preferred pronouns. During CNN’s Equality Town Hall this month, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) walked onto the stage and announced her preferred pronouns as “she, her, and hers.”

CNN’s Chris Cuomo issued an awkward response, which ultimately triggered backlash.

“‘She,’ ‘her,’ and ‘hers’? Mine, too,” he said, later apologizing for the remark:

PLEASE READ: When Sen. Harris said her pronouns were she her and her's, I said mine too. I should not have. I apologize. I am an ally of the LGBTQ community, and I am sorry because I am committed to helping us achieve equality. Thank you for watching our townhall. — Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) October 11, 2019

Like Harris, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has publicly specified her preferred pronouns, listing “She/her” on her Twitter bio:

Preferred pronouns have become a topic of interest among far-left millennials and social justice warriors, particularly. Those who identify as part of the ultra-progressive group argue that gender is a social construct and should be viewed as a spectrum, hence the varying genders and accompanying pronouns. Preferred pronouns can range from the traditional “his” or “hers” to lesser-known terms such as “xem,” “hirself,” “xyrs,” or “zir.”"

Other points on which the Democrats came together in peace and harmony:

— Trump should be impeached.

— Abortion is great.

— Obamacare sucks.

At least we’re all finally agreed on Obamacare!

Obamacare has given us a system — to quote Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont — “which is dysfunctional, which is cruel, 87 million uninsured, 30,000 people dying every single year, 500,000 people going bankrupt for one reason, they came down with cancer.”

None of the Democrats disagreed with Sanders’ description of health care in American today, although they have slightly different solutions.

I don’t mean to be rude, but I thought Obamacare was supposed to fix health care.

Millions of us were thrown off our health insurance plans by Obamacare, and now I find out that it didn’t even make things better for anyone else. The government intervenes, everything goes to hell, then Democrats cite the hell they created to demand another massive government intervention.

The motto of all socialist schemes should be: “This time, it will be different.”

The Democrats’ universal answer to the drug problem — which is actually a “Mexico Is on Our Border” problem — is to say they’d go after the pharmaceutical companies and then, in the next breath, demand that we legalize drugs.

In the midst of their crusading anger at the pharmaceutical companies, not one Democrat mentioned Purdue Pharma. You know — the primary culprit in the prescription drug epidemic, at least according to dozens of state attorneys general and hundreds of private lawsuits accusing the company of aggressively marketing OxyContin and hiding its addictive nature.

It would be like vowing to go after “middle-aged men” to stop underage sex trafficking on Orgy Island — but not mentioning Jeffrey Epstein.

The Democrats are furious with pharmaceutical companies, “wealthy corporations” (Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s phrase) and “the rich” (any guy with an alarm clock). But not with a specific multibillion-dollar company that makes OxyContin, and the kazillionaire family that owns it, the Sacklers.

Speaking of which, last year, Beverly Sackler, the recently deceased matriarch of the company, made political contributions to both Sen. Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.

Some poor medical researcher working to find a cure for cancer will have to pay — but the Sacklers get off scot-free.

Another big policy disagreement concerned guns, specifically: Do we allow people to turn in their guns voluntarily or should the government confiscate them?

As with liberals’ comical inability to tell an AK-47 from a semiautomatic, the gun facts flying around Tuesday night were not always well-researched. Beto O’Rourke said, “This is a country that loses 40,000 of our fellow Americans every year to gun violence.”

Wow. Not even close. According to the CDC, the number was less than 15,000 in 2017.

To liven things up, at one point, a smug Pete Buttigieg snapped at O’Rourke, “And I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.” This was in response to remarks not at all about Buttigieg’s courage. That’s gonna get old, fast.

Vice President Joe Biden bragged that he was “the only one on this stage who has taken on the NRA and beat them, and beat them twice. We were able to get assault weapons off the streets …”

Yes, and in direct response to that assault weapons ban opposed by the NRA, Republicans swept Congress in the very next election, winning control of the House for the first time in nearly half a century.

If you weren’t alive that glorious autumn evening in 1994, it was better than the November 2016 election. All night, there was breaking news, as one powerhouse Democrat after another lost his seat to a Republican. Every 15 minutes the GOP would set some new, jaw-dropping record. Thomas Foley, D-Wash., became the first speaker of the House to lose his election in 134 years. Republicans marched through the South like William Tecumseh Sherman, finishing off the “southern Democrats.” Tennessee went all red, with Republicans replacing the Democratic governor and two Democratic senators — including the Senate seat previously held by Vice President Al Gore. Not one Republican incumbent lost his seat.

Please, Joe, promise to “beat” the NRA again!

BUTTIGIEG: “No, this is really important, OK? On guns, we are this close to an assault weapons ban.”

But President Donald Trump’s staff used the Democrat debate to tout the rising blue-collar wages in his economy.

The questioners from CNN and the New York Times asked about trade, abortion, monopolies, the opioid epidemic, guns, and much else, but did not ask the candidates how they could change government policy to help raise Americans’ wages, which have been stalled since roughly 1990.

The candidates promised indirect government aid to Americans, such as “Medicare for All,” free college, and a rollback of pharmaceutical monopolies. Sen. Bernie Sanders promised a “jobs guarantee,” Andrew Yang touted his “freedom dividend” — which would be a $1,000 monthly check for each American adult — and Sen. Elizabeth Warren urged higher wages for childcare workers and pre-school teachers.

In contrast, Trump’s team emailed reporters a list of favorable media quotes admitting that his lower-immigration economy is helping to raise wages after decades of minimal growth. The email, which was sent mid-debate, was headlined: “Blue-collar workers are seeing big benefits from the Trump economy,” and it said:

America’s historic low unemployment rate of 3.5%, the lowest in fifty years, is unlocking opportunities for working class Americans.

From the Chicago Tribune: “What’s most heartening is that this jobs boom is helping the less-educated, low-skill Americans who’ve missed out on other, weaker jobs recoveries. Mark this moment: Millions of American job seekers have prayed for it.” Meanwhile, wage growth has exceeded 3% for eight out of nine months in 2019, and February’s wage growth of 3.4% was the strongest growth in a decade. Moreover, for the first time since 2009, the benefits of wage growth are predominantly going to “workers at the lower end of the pay scale.” From the New York Times: “The decade-long recovery is at last delivering income gains to middle-class and low-income families.”

From the Washington Post: “The surge of minority women getting jobs has helped push the U.S. workforce across a historic threshold. For the first time, most new hires of prime working age (25 to 54) are people of color.”

From the Economic Policy Institute: “From 2017 to 2018, relatively fast growth continued at the top…but the 20th and 30th percentiles saw the strongest growth at 4.8 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively.”

The Census Bureau said on September 10 that men who work full time and year-round got an average earnings boost of 3.4 percent in 2018, pushing their median salaries up to $55,291. Women gained 3.3 percent in wages, bringing their median salaries to $45,097 for full time, year-round work.

CNN and the New York Times also choose to ignore the decisive issue of 2016 — immigration, which has cut Americans’ wages amid a post-1990 flood of cheaper labor.

For example, income growth is lagging for American graduates, partly because the federal government allows investors to keep roughly 1.5 million college-graduate visa workers in good jobs sought by American graduates.

White House touts modest wage-gains in Trump's Buy/Hire American economy. Puzzle #1: Wage gains for college-grads lag behind gains for non-college employees. Puzzle #2: Why do white-collar journos not investigate slowdown to their college peers' salaries? https://t.co/TYy7deCWQ8 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) August 15, 2019

Immigration Numbers:

Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or a university. This total includes about 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled degrees in business or health care, engineering or science, software, or statistics.

But the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants and refreshes a resident population of about 1.5 million white-collar visa workers — including approximately one million H-1B workers and spouses — and about 500,000 blue-collar visa workers. The government also prints more than one million work permits for new foreigners and rarely punishes companies for employing illegal migrants.

This policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth and stock values for investors. The stimulus happens because the extra labor ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions.

The federal policy of flooding the market with cheap, foreign white-collar graduates and blue-collar labor shifts wealth from young employees toward older investors. It also widens wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, reduces marriage rates, and hurts children’s schools and college educations.

The cheap-labor economic strategy also pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and it sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with drug addictions.

The labor policy also moves business investment and wealth from the Heartland to the coastal cities, explodes rents and housing costs, undermines suburbia, shrivels real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech, labor-intensive workplaces."

CNN and the New York Times opened the debate with a discussion on the partisan-based impeachment inquiry.

“Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support,” Anderson Cooper, one of the debate’s moderators, said.

“Sen. Warren, I want to start with you,” Cooper continued.

“You have said that there’s already enough evidence for President Trump to be impeached and removed from office. But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate?” he asked.

The Massachusetts senator said impeachment is necessary because the president broke the law “over and over.” She said she initially made the determination after reading the Mueller report and falsely claimed that Mueller had shown “that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly,” despite the fact that Mueller made no such determination.

Attorney General William Barr determined that Trump did not obstruct justice, explaining that the evidence was “not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense.”

“Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences,” Warren said, adding that impeachment is about Trump as well as “the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country.”

“The impeachment must go forward,” she proclaimed.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) concurred, repeating the false claim that Trump obstructed justice and calling him the “most corrupt president in the history of this country.”

“I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment because of the emoluments clause. This is a president who is enriching himself while using the Oval Office to do that, and that is outrageous,” he said, adding that he looks forward to a “speedy and expeditious impeachment process.”

“Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate,” he added.

While there are varying degrees of support, all of Warren and Sanders’ colleagues signaled support for the Democrat-led impeachment efforts.

Here are their most significant lines on impeachment:

Joe Biden (D):

I said from the beginning that if, in fact, Trump continued to stonewall what the Congress is entitled to know about his background, what he did, all the accusations in the Mueller report, if they did that, they would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information. This president — and I agree with Bernie, Sen. Sanders — is the most corrupt president in modern history and I think all of our history. And the fact is that this president of the United States has gone so far as to say, since this latest event, that, in fact, he will not cooperate in any way at all, will not list any witnesses, will not provide any information, will not do anything to cooperate with the impeachment. They have no choice but to move.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA):

But the reality of it is that I don’t really think this impeachment process is going to take very long, because as a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it. And he did it in plain sight. He has given us the evidence. And he tried to cover it up, putting it in that special server. And there’s been a clear consciousness of guilt. This will not take very long. Donald Trump needs to be held accountable. He is, indeed, the most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had.

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ):

Anybody who has criticisms about a process that is making all the facts bare before the American public, that works to build consensus, that’s what this nation needs, in what is a moral moment and not a political one. So I swore an oath to do my job as a senator, do my duty. This president has violated his. I will do mine.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN):

We can do two things at once. That’s our job. We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment, but we also can stand up for America, because this president has not been putting America in front of his own personal interests.

Julián Castro (D):

Not only that, what we have to recognize is that not only did the Mueller report point out ten different instances where the president obstructed justice or tried to, and he made that call to President Zelensky of the Ukraine, but he is in ongoingly — in an ongoing way violating his oath of office and abusing his power. We have to impeach this president. And the majority of Americans not only support impeachment, they support removal. He should be removed.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D):

Look, the president has left the Congress with no choice. And this is not just about holding the president accountable, for not just the things emerging in these investigations, but actions that he has confessed to on television. It’s also about the presidency itself, because a president ten years or 100 years from now will look back at this moment and draw the conclusion either that no one is above the law or that a president can get away with anything.

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI):

The serious issues that have been raised around this phone call that he had with the president of Ukraine and many other things that transpired around that are what caused me to support the inquiry in the House. And I think that it should continue to play its course out, to gather all the information, provide that to the American people, recognizing that that is the only way forward. If the House votes to impeach, the Senate does not vote to remove Donald Trump, he walks out and he feels exonerated, further deepening the divides in this country that we cannot afford.

Tom Steyer (D):

Two years ago, I started the Need to Impeach movement, because I knew there was something desperately wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, that we did have the most corrupt president in the country, and that only the voice and the will of the American people would drag Washington to see it as a matter of right and wrong, not of political expediency. So, in fact, impeaching and removing this president is something that the American people are demanding. They’re the voice that counts, and that’s who I went to, the American people.

Andrew Yang (D):

I support impeachment, but we shouldn’t have any illusions that impeaching Donald Trump will, one, be successful or, two, erase the problems that got him elected in 2016.

Beto O’Rourke (D):

And we have a responsibility to be fearless in the face of this president’s criminality and his lawlessness. The fact that as a candidate for the highest office in the land, he invited the participation, the invasion of a foreign power in our democracy. As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the FBI, tried to fire Mueller, head of the investigation, then invited President Zelensky to involve himself in our politics, as well as China, in exchange for favorable trade terms in an upcoming trade deal.

Trump reacted to the Democrat debate on Wednesday, writing, “You would think there is NO WAY that any of the Democrat Candidates that we witnessed last night could possibly become President of the United States.”

“Now you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal & absurd Impeachment of one of the most successful Presidents!” he exclaimed:

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced on Tuesday that the House will hold off on a House-wide vote on the impeachment inquiry.

“There’s no requirement that we have a vote, and at this time, we will not have a vote,” Pelosi said at a press conference on Tuesday.

“We’re not here to call bluffs. We’re here to find the truth, to uphold the Constitution of the United States,” she added. “This is not a game for us, this is deadly serious.”"

“Tuesday night’s debate was one more reminder that we are living through the death of the Democratic Party,” Gingrich declares, as we watch it mutate before our eyes into the “Democratic-Socialist Party.”

We are living in “a historic moment in which a once-great American party is transformed into an anti-American engine of radical change,” Gingrich observes. “In 2020, every Democratic candidate will be faced with the challenge of defending a national party which is now the Democratic-Socialist Party.”

In Tuesday’s debate, candidates were falling over each other to establish their far-left creds, leaving behind the platforms of the last two Democrat administrations as a vestige of relative moderation.

“Imagine that any candidate last night had had the courage (or lack of sense) to actively defend President Bill Clinton’s policies on welfare reform, capital gains tax cuts, balanced federal budgets, or his 1996 State of the Union assertion that ‘the era of Big Government is over,’” Gingrich muses.

The same goes for Barack Obama’s original 2008 position that “I believe marriage is between a man and a woman” or his stated opposition to “any limitation on the right to buy private insurance.”

“When the last two Democratic presidents are no longer defendable, something profound has happened,” Gingrich observes.

Imagine further that one of the candidates had said he or she were against abortion, Gingrich continues. “The result might have been a riot – and at a minimum an expulsion of the heretic.”

Or imagine if one of the candidates had argued that our schools “should not be centers of anti-American indoctrination dictated by left-wing unions,” he asserts. “They would be booed off the stage.”

Almost overnight the Old Democratic Party has given way to an almost unrecognizable radical caricature of itself, which is more and more overtly socialist and less and less democratic.

“Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is now the spiritual leader of House Democrats, and every major Democratic presidential candidate has endorsed radical Green New Deal-type proposals that would expand government, destroy the energy industry, radically change America, and plunge the economy into a depression,” Gingrich notes.

“The Democratic-Socialist Party wants to outlaw private health insurance, punish the successful (especially the wealthy), and expand government control over virtually everything,” he says.

Their proposals range from “wanting to confiscate guns” to “forcing the radical California gender curriculum in every state” to “removing the tax exception for every church, synagogue, and mosque that defines marriage as between a man and a woman,” he notes.

They also include providing taxpayer-funded health care to people living in the country illegally, open borders, and tax-paid sex-change operations in prison, he adds.

The dizzying pace at which the party has been revolutionized calls for thoughtful Americans to pause and ponder the historical significance of what is happening before our eyes, Gingrich suggests.

It is “a wrenching, defining moment for the party of FDR and JFK as it is conquered by the party of AOC, Sanders, and Warren,” he concludes.

Little clarity could be found on the subject during Tuesday night’s Democrat presidential debate , during which the candidates energetically criticized President Donald Trump, but grew vague and evasive when asked to describe the situation in Syria or explain how they would handle it.

Former Vice President Joe Biden boasted about how much time he spent in the White House on foreign policy and Syria for a while, then seemingly threatened to declare war on Turkey, something neither he nor any other Democrat would actually do if they became president:

I would not have withdrawn the troops and I would not have withdrawn the additional thousand troops who are in Iraq, which are in retreat now, being fired on by Assad’s people. And the president of the United States saying, if those ISIS folks escape from the prisons they’re in, they’ll only go to Europe and won’t affect us. It has been the most shameful thing that any president has done in modern history — excuse me, in terms of foreign policy. And the fact of the matter is, I’ve never seen a time — and I’ve spent thousands of hours in the Situation Room, I’ve spent many hours on the ground in those very places, in Syria and in Iraq, and guess what? Our commanders across the board, former and present, are ashamed of what’s happening here. What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where he’s going to have a problem — because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real lockdown conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done now. Pay that price.

Note that there is no evidence of the Syrian army firing at American troops, but Biden might have been confusing Syrian with Turkish forces, which have reportedly fired uncomfortably close to American positions in Iraq.

A real journalist would have pointed out to Biden that some of the Syrian groups his administration told us were reliable “white hat” military allies have joined the Turks to attack the Kurds and asked how he failed to discern the true nature of those groups during the “thousands of hours” he boasted of spending in the White House Situation Room, but fortunately for Biden, CNN does not employ anyone who would ask a question like that of a Democrat.

The only candidate who did not try to stuff herself into a war hawk costume at the debate was Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), who got to speak next, and challenged both Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Mayor Pete Buttigieg on their positions.

Gabbard has her own issues when it comes to Syria — which she attempted to deal with by denying that she has been a “Russian asset” or “Assad apologist” — and she professed to have qualms about President Trump’s sudden pullout from the Turkish border region, but she described the Turkish attack on the Kurds as “yet another negative consequence of the regime change war we’ve been waging in Syria,” a war the media was “championing and cheerleading” throughout the Obama administration.

Gabbard said she would take two steps on Syria: ending sanctions against the Assad regime “that are really a modern-day siege, the likes of which we are seeing Saudi Arabia wage against Yemen, that have caused tens of thousands of Syrian civilians to die and to starve,” and ending U.S. support for Syrian rebel forces, some of which are linked to terrorist groups like al-Qaeda. Neither of those steps would ameliorate Turkey’s concerns in any way or persuade it to halt its invasion of Syria.

Gabbard taunted Warren about living up to the anti-war stance she took so ostentatiously during the second Bush administration. Warren, boxed into a corner, had nothing meaningful to say beyond vague platitudes about getting out of the Middle East “the smart way” and complaints about Trump helping ISIS “get another foothold, a new lease on life.”

“I sit on the Armed Services Committee. I talk with our military leaders about this. I was in Iraq and went through the neighborhoods that ISIS destroyed. We need to get out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no military solution in this region,” Warren said.

Turkey certainly seems to think there is a “military solution” to its security concerns, having worked for years to obtain a “negotiated solution” without satisfactory results. Russia and Iran somehow found a “military solution” to the Syrian civil war.

CNN moved very quickly along to Buttigieg, who was allowed to simultaneously claim he opposes “endless wars” but also call for an endless American presence in the worst quagmire on the planet.

Buttigieg, a military veteran, abandoned years of Democrat Party dogma about Afghanistan being the “good war” to argue that Syria is the only place American troops should be stationed.

“Look, I didn’t think we should have gone to Iraq in the first place. I think we need to get out of Afghanistan. But it’s also the case that a small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we’re seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS,” he said.

Buttigieg claimed pulling out of Syria would be “taking away what makes America America” and would make “the world a more dangerous place,” which oddly enough is exactly the opposite of what Democrats said when they urged a pullout from Iraq. They used to get very angry at people who implied their criticism of the Iraq deployment would be “taking away what makes America America.” They routinely portrayed American soldiers in Iraq as helpless victims of the insurgency whose lives were being squandered.

Gabbard jumped in and called Buttigieg out on his claim to oppose endless wars while “continuing to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an indefinite period of time to continue this regime change war,” a policy that involves “providing arms in support to terrorist groups in Syria, like al-Qaeda, HTS, al-Nusra and others.”

Buttigieg never answered her question. Instead, he claimed he would not be able to look Afghan civilians or soldiers in the eye after Trump’s pullout from Syria, which is funny because not three minutes earlier he said he wanted to pull out from Afghanistan.

Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) refused to say whether he would support kicking Turkey out of NATO but insisted Turkey should no longer be seen as a U.S. ally “when they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter.” Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) evaded the same question about NATO membership, condemning Turkey’s actions as “outrageous” and a “horror” but advising continued engagement and negotiations with Turkey.

Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) said Trump endangered U.S. national security by “basically giving 10,000 ISIS fighters a get-out-of-jail-free card” and making the Islamic State one of the “big winners” in Syria, in addition to Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime. It appears to have escaped her notice that the latter three were already the “big winners” in Syria before Trump’s election, even though she boasted of sitting on the Senate Intelligence Committee, where such things are presumably discussed.

Biden came back to wrap up the Syria section of the debate with a characteristically disjointed rant about how Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan “understands if he’s out of NATO, he’s in real trouble,” but also efforts to break up NATO are the demonic work of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“And with regard to regime change in Syria, that has not been the policy we change the regime. It has been to make sure that the regime did not wipe out hundreds of thousands of innocent people between there and the Iraqi border,” Biden insisted, forgetting that President Obama explicitly stated Assad had to go, and a very large number of innocent people were indeed “wiped out” or driven out of Syria on his and Obama’s watch.

Biden’s rambling closer typifies the problem the Democrats face on Syria: All of them, with the exception of no-hope candidate Tulsi Gabbard, want to virtue-signal as loud as they can and slam President Trump as hard as possible, but none of them wants to discuss the details of what has been happening in Syria since 2011 or propose a cogent strategy for changing conditions on the ground in a meaningful way. None of them talked about an “exit strategy,” a phrase they were very big on during the Iraq operation.

None of the Democrats wanted to discuss Turkey’s claims of a severe security threat from northeastern Syria, discuss why the international community did nothing to address those claims, or explain why the United States was held solely responsible for preventing Turkey from taking action. They treated the notion of Russian and Syrian involvement against the Turkish assault as inherently outrageous without explaining why the Syrian government should not be held responsible for protecting its own citizens and securing its own borders. They complained about escaping ISIS prisoners without discussing why thousands of them were still parked in Kurdish prison camps and how long they should be left there.

None of the Democrats was asked to present a war plan for fighting Turkey or discuss how much the U.S. depends on Turkish bases for operations in the Middle East. None of them, not even Biden, was pressed on how the Obama administration set the table for current events. None of them acknowledged the difficulty of getting reliable information from any party involved in the savage Syrian civil war, although Gabbard came close when she pointed out how dodgy some of the groups supported by the Obama administration were.

And of course, CNN would not dream of asking the Democrat candidates — several of whom are sitting senators — why their caucus did not authorize military force against Turkey to protect the Kurds, instead spending all of its time on an impeachment crusade against President Trump. Trump said he wanted to pull troops out of Syria almost a year ago, and Erdogan was threatening to invade long before that. The Democrats had plenty of time to pass the appropriate congressional resolutions and send a strong message to Turkey, but that would have involved putting real political capital on the line instead of sniping from the sidelines."

Joe Biden (D) has been under fire in recent days after it was reported that his campaign dropped short of $1 million – $924,000 – on private jet usage in the third quarter (July 1 – September 30) alone. The expenses were attributed to the EJCR, LLC Dba Advanced Aviation Team, recent Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings show.

While Biden leads the pack, he is not alone in his exorbitant private air travel expenditures. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) reportedly spent just short of $500,000 – $479,000 – on private air travel. That is a $179,000 increase from his private air travel expenses in the previous quarter, according to the Hill.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) also put her climate change-related concerns aside, spending $253,000– $236,000 more than the $17,000 she spent in the previous three months.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) – who once described climate change as the “greatest threat to our national security” – spent $360,000 on private air travel in the third quarter. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) – who described climate change as an “existential crisis that threatens all of us” – also utilized private air travel, spending $132,000 in the third quarter. However, a campaign aide told the Hill that Warren makes an effort to offset her carbon output and gave $10,150 to Native Energy in the third quarter.

An outline of the Democrat-backed Green New Deal, released this year, lamented the existence of cows and air travel but admitted that neither could be totally eliminated.

The outline stated:

We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero.

The excessive air travel of the candidates calls their authenticity into question.

Warren has called climate change an “existential crisis that threatens all of us” and called for “bold action now to stop it before it’s too late”:

Biden – who spent nearly $1 million on private jet usage in a three-month span – warned that it is going to take “leadership” to combat the “climate crisis”:

Harris has called climate change an “imminent threat to our planet,” while Buttigieg warned that the threat “isn’t theoretical”:

Climate change isn't theoretical. Parts of California are on fire, in Florida they're talking about sea level rise.

Donald Trump believes climate change is a hoax. Donald Trump is an idiot. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) August 10, 2019

Nevertheless, critics argue that Democrats are demonstrating that they are not taking the matter seriously, as their actions do not always coincide with their rhetoric.

For instance, Democrats came under fire last month after attending the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry, which featured thousands of steaks. While climate change alarmists argue that red meat consumption is contributing to the “crisis,” several Democrat candidates happily assisted in grilling the juicy cuts of meat, despite some of the presidential hopefuls previously floating limiting beef consumption in order to curb the looming threat:

(CNN) Within the first 10 minutes of Tuesday's fourth presidential debate, you could tell something fundamental had changed in the race: Elizabeth Warren is the new front-runner.

The Massachusetts senator was attacked from all sides from the get-go -- on how she planned to fund her ""Medicare for All"" plan, on the ""punitive"" nature of her policy solutions, and on her supposed claims to be the only one in the field who had bold ideas.

By our count, at least seven other candidates on the stage attacked Warren at some point during the three-hour debate. That dynamic ensured that the fourth debate wouldn't be as successful for Warren as the previous three -- no one can take that amount of incoming and emerge unscathed -- but also proved, very clearly, that no matter what the polls show, her rivals believe her to be the one to beat in this race.

We've reflected that changed reality in our latest 2020 rankings. Below, the 10 men and women with the best chance of emerging as the Democratic nominee in 2020.

Her rising 2020 polling numbers are also striking fear in the heart of Big Oil.,2019-10-17,CNN,How Elizabeth Warren could 'vaporize' America's oil boom,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/17/business/elizabeth-warren-oil-fracking-ban/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Elizabeth Warren doesn't just pose a threat to Wall Street. Her rising 2020 polling numbers are also striking fear in the heart of Big Oil.

Warren, currently the odds-on favorite to be the Democratic presidential nominee, wants to ban fracking ""everywhere."" And the Massachusetts senator pledged to immediately sign an executive order to stop all new offshore drilling leases. Both steps go further than her main rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.

It would be wildly bullish for crude oil prices. We'd be heading back to triple-digit prices very fast.""

Warren's aggressive plan for fighting the climate crisis could have profound consequences for the oil and gas industry. Although an outright fracking ban seems unlikely to get through Congress and the courts, such a move would halt America's historic shale oil boom in its tracks, drive up gasoline prices, threaten good-paying jobs and make the nation more dependent on foreign oil.

""It would vaporize the oil and gas boom in the United States,"" said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, a consulting firm that advises energy companies and investors. ""There is palpable concern in the oil and gas industry.""

Wall Street analysts are already warning shareholders about the potential hit to the share prices of oil companies, which remain widely held in portfolios despite the climate crisis.

Pioneer Natural Resources PXD ExxonMobil XOM Chevron CVX ""We think the greatest risk to energy companies would occur if Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren wins,"" RBC Capital Markets wrote in a report published on Monday. The firm said it would be ""very bearish"" for a wide range of oil companies, including drillers such as, oilfield service firms and even integrated companies likeand

Warren's campaign declined to comment. But the candidate has defended her aggressive stance by arguing the world doesn't have the luxury of playing it safe.

""Taking bold action to confront the climate crisis is as important — and as urgent — as anything else the next president will face. We cannot wait,"" Warren wrote in a Medium post last month.

The best-case scenario for the oil industry could be the reelection of President Donald Trump, a climate skeptic who has actively supported the fossil fuel industry by slashing environmental regulations and promoting energy exports.

Democrats have taken a much more skeptical approach towards Big Oil than Trump as they pledge to tackle climate change. The leading candidates have called for ending fossil fuel subsidies

Besides Warren, Democratic presidential nominees Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker have also pushed to ban fracking , the controversial drilling technique that involves shooting water, sand and other compounds underground to release trapped oil and gas. Fracking has sparked concerns of contaminated drinking water, methane emissions and even earthquakes.

That's why environmental groups strongly support a fracking ban.

""A clean energy economy built to tackle the climate crisis cannot include fracked gas, which is a bridge to climate disaster,"" Ariel Hayes, national political director at the Sierra Club, said in a statement to CNN Business.

'Wildly bullish' for oil prices

Fracking, which gained popularity in the early 2000s, has made the United States the world's leading producer of natural gas and, more recently, the top oil producer . In 2016, fracking accounted for more than two-thirds of all oil and natural gas wells drilled in the United States, according to the Energy Information Administration

Driven by the shale revolution, US oil production has more than doubled over the past decade to about 12 million barrels per day. That surge of oil has cushioned the blow from recent events, including oil barrels sidelined by the attack on Saudi Aramco and US sanctions on Iran and Venezuela.

An outright fracking ban would probably send crude oil prices soaring because the United States produces more oil than any other country on the planet. The world is relying on US oil shale oil as the main source of growth for the next several years.

""It would be wildly bullish for crude oil prices. We'd be heading back to triple-digit prices very fast,"" said McNally, a former energy official under President George W. Bush.

Oil jobs at risk

But it wouldn't be bullish for the oil industry. That's because the fracking ban would probably cause highly leveraged US shale oil producers to go bankrupt, or at least have limited financial firepower to take advantage of high prices.

""They will have been regulated out of business,"" McNally said. ""And the US oil companies that remain will get blamed for high oil prices.""

A fracking ban could wipe out countless good-paying jobs in the oil and gas industry.

""You'd have layoffs, everything from the field hands up to the C-Suite,"" said Jeff Bush, president of oil and gas recruiting firm CSI Recruiting.

A 2017 study paid for by the American Petroleum Institute found that a fracking ban would cause the loss of nearly 6 million jobs and lift household energy spending by $4,500 a year.

Warren has pledged to create new jobs to help workers who are hurt by the transition to a greener economy.

Senator Elizabeth Warren has pledged to immediately put a stop to new fossil fuel leases for drilling offshore and on public lands.

""We will no longer force workers to make the impossible choice between fossil fuel industry jobs with superior wages and benefits and green economy jobs that pay far less,"" Warren wrote in the Medium post.

A fracking ban might not have a large impact on prices if oil demand weakened because of a rapid shift towards electric vehicles

However, most forecasters expect the world's appetite for oil will rise for many years, if not decades. And even Warren's own energy plan doesn't call for 100% zero emissions for new vehicles until 2030.

That means diminished domestic oil production would likely make America more dependent on foreign crude, undoing its strides toward energy independence.

""It's not going to reduce consumption,"" said Bush. ""It just means we'd be buying more oil from overseas. I don't think anybody wants that.""

An outright fracking ban also would require an act of Congress, according to analysts.

Such legislation would be unlikely to get through Congress because Republicans are widely expected to maintain control of the Senate. Even if the Senate flipped, moderate Democrats in oil-producing states such as Colorado and New Mexico would face pressure to oppose such a ban.

""There is no real clean path towards a fracking ban,"" said Josh Price, senior analyst at Height Capital Markets. ""It seems completely unrealistic, close to impossible.""

Federal drilling ban could slow oil boom

Still, Warren could take regulatory and executive actions aimed at discouraging fracking.

For instance, RBC said Warren would probably be able to ban fracking and all output on federal lands. Oil output on federal lands is about 2.7 million barrels per day, or 22% of total output.

If such a ban took effect in early 2021, it would slash US oil production by about 300,000 barrels per day that year, RBC said. And by 2025, the firm's US oil production forecast would decline by 1.2 million barrels per day.

The loss of US barrels would drive global oil prices $5 to $10 higher, lifting gasoline prices by 10 cents to 25 cents a gallon, according to RBC. And federal oil and gas revenue would tumble by up to $20 billion.

In sum, even though energy investors might respond negatively to a Warren victory, her proposed crackdown on Big Oil would face enormous challenges, from court fights and economic pressure to a potential political backlash.

""The market could overreact,"" RBC analysts wrote, ""which may provide fundamental buying opportunities.""

In other words, Warren's bark may be tougher than her bite, at least when it comes to oil."

Zuckerbe… [+1595 chars]","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is set to deliver what he says is his most ""comprehensive take"" yet on freedom of expression Thursday in Washington, amid a roiling controversy over how the company handles political speech.",2019-10-17,CNN,Mark Zuckerberg giving speech on freedom of expression,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/17/tech/mark-zuckerberg-free-expression-speech-georgetown/index.html,"Washington (CNN Business) Facebook ( FB ) CEO Mark Zuckerberg sought to recast the challenges facing his company in a historical light on Thursday, describing social media as a kind of ""Fifth Estate"" and describing politicians' calls to clamp down on tech companies as an effort to restrict the freedom of expression.

In a speech citing landmark Supreme Court cases and historical figures such as Frederick Douglass, Zuckerberg told an audience at Georgetown University that during times of social upheaval, policymakers have instinctively sought to limit the freedom of speech.

""The impulse is to pull back from free expression,"" he said. But, he continued, ""We are at a crossroads. We can either stand for free expression ... or we can decide the cost is simply too great. We must continue to stand for free expression.""

Zuckerberg had said in a Facebook post Wednesday that the speech would reflect his lengthy, ""unfiltered"" views on threats to free speech worldwide and the speech-related problems that the internet has created.

Speaking with a tinge of wonder and amazement in his voice, Zuckerberg offered soaring assessments of social media's promise, citing powerful movements that organized digitally such as #MeToo and Black Lives Matter — the latter of which, he said, first became a hashtag on Facebook itself.

But invoking civil rights icons like Martin Luther King, Jr. and historic cultural uprisings didn't sit well with Zuckerberg's critics in the civil rights community. Alicia Garza, a cofounder of Black Lives Matter, said Thursday that Zuckerberg had co-opted the organization's name to make a point.

""If he wants to use our movement to claim support for Black communities, then Black lives have to matter more than his bottom line,"" Garza tweeted

Color of Change, a civil rights advocacy group, said Facebook needs to be held to a higher standard.

""Facebook's ultimate hypocrisy,"" it said, ""is touting the platform's contributions to social justice movements like Black Lives Matter, but simultaneously rejecting any of the rules or regulations that would actually protect Black lives.""

Last spring, the largest Black Lives Matter page on Facebook was shut down after CNN revealed that the page was a scam tied to a middle-aged white man in Australia. The page helped raise thousands of dollars for the movement, but at least some of the money was later transferred to Australian bank accounts. Black Lives Matter had contacted Facebook about the page months earlier, suspecting it was a scam, but Facebook did not suspend the page until CNN's reporting.

During the speech, Zuckerberg pushed back on criticism of Facebook's handling of political advertising, saying he briefly considered banning political ads entirely from Facebook.

""From a business perspective,"" he said, ""the controversy certainly is not worth the very small part of our business that they make up."" But he ultimately decided against a ban, he said, concluding that political ads ""can be an important part of voice"" and that even if Facebook eliminated political ads from its platform, other types of ads could come under scrutiny as well, and it would be difficult to draw a line.

""I don't think most people want to live in a world where you can only post things that tech companies judge to be 100 percent true,"" Zuckerberg said.

Zuckerberg went on to discuss how tech companies — including his — pose a potential threat to freedom of expression, and returned to a familiar argument: That independent bodies should be responsible for developing rules and norms surrounding content.

He then pivoted to argue for his company's forthcoming oversight board , which will give users the ability to appeal Facebook's content decisions to a panel of outside experts.

Zuckerberg also reiterated another claim: That efforts to restrict US tech companies could lead to unintended consequences such as allowing Chinese competitors to dictate the terms of speech and innovation.

""If another nation's platforms set the rules, our nation's discourse could be set by a completely different set of values,"" he said. ""We should be proactive and write policies that help free expression triumph around the world.""

The entrepreneur said his concerns about freedom of expression extend beyond the United States, underscoring how Zuckerberg views himself and his company as being at the center of an epic struggle of ideas that has stretched on for centuries.

""Increasingly, we're seeing countries try to impose their speech restrictions beyond their country,"" Zuckerberg said during a question-and-answer session with students. He slammed a recent ruling by the European Court of Justice holding that Facebook can be required to delete content worldwide that is considered illegal in individual European countries.

""This is incredibly problematic and troubling,"" Zuckerberg added, saying there will undoubtedly be future litigation that Facebook will participate in seeking to establish how that ruling should be implemented.

Faced with two questions — one about allegations of Facebook's bias against conservatives and one about Facebook's outreach to conservatives — Zuckerberg quipped, to laughter: ""I think it would be hard to be biased against both sides.""

Facebook has recently found itself at the center of a debate about truthfulness in political ads after Facebook declined to remove an ad by President Trump's campaign that contained unfounded allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden. The result has been an uproar over Facebook's policy allowing politicians to lie in their campaign advertisements.

Bill Russo, a spokesman for Biden's campaign, accused Zuckerberg on Thursday of having ""attempted to use the Constitution as a shield for his company's bottom line.""

""His choice to cloak Facebook's policy in a feigned concern for free expression,"" he added, ""demonstrates how unprepared his company is for this unique moment in our history and how little it has learned over the past few years.""

Facebook and many legal experts have defended the company's right not to censor political candidates, but some critics including Sen. Elizabeth Warren have slammed the company for running what Warren termed a ""disinformation-for-profit machine.""

Asked about calls by politicians including Warren for the breakup of Facebook, Zuckerberg referred to a previously leaked recording of his remarks at a companywide meeting at which he'd acknowledged that a Warren presidency could mean an antitrust lawsuit filed by the US seeking that breakup. Zuckerberg at first said he didn't have much more to add. But in the event of a lawsuit to break up the company, he said, ""of course we'll stand up for ourselves and for what we believe is right.""

Despite the companies' efforts, concerns about the tech industry's handling of offensive speech and disinformation have continued to mount as the 2020 election cycle gets underway.

Google GOOG Facebook has launched a civil rights task force to monitor for election and census interference, andhas hired some 10,000 employees worldwide to tackle content moderation.

But skeptics say the companies have dragged their feet for too long. At a congressional hearing Wednesday, Oregon Republican Rep. Greg Walden said social media companies have been too ""slow to clean up"" their platforms while too quick to claim legal immunity for content under a law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.

""Many of our concerns can be readily addressed if companies just enforce their terms of service,"" said Walden."

She is active in coalition efforts to reform our private retirement system to ensure an adequate, secure, and affordable retirement for all workers. She is a member of the National Academy of Social Insurance. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.

(CNN) America is facing a looming crisis as generations of workers who mostly participated in do-it-yourself savings plans — or no plan at all — approach retirement.

Though a few high-income households have amassed small fortunes in tax-favored retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s and IRAs, at least half of working households are expected to see a steep drop in their living standards once they retire due to the decline of traditional pensions, a lack of savings and cuts to Social Security. That not only poses big risks for America's seniors, but it threatens the US economy as well.

Members of Congress are waking up to the problem and proposing a flurry of Social Security expansion plans that could help alleviate the crisis. One of the most promising bills , championed by Rep. John Larson, would expand benefits by 2% for most workers — more for low earners. It would raise enough revenue to fund these benefits and to close a projected shortfall by slowly increasing the payroll tax rate and by taxing earnings above $400,000. Earnings above $132,900 aren't currently subject to Social Security tax, but most expansion plans, like Larson's, would scrap or amend this cap to raise revenue. So far, Larson's proposal has garnered a lot of support from fellow Democrats, with more than 200 sponsors.

The latest proposal, from Sen. Elizabeth Warren , goes even further. Warren's plan provides for an extra $200 per month for beneficiaries — a roughly 15% increase for the average beneficiary and a nearly 25% increase for low-income seniors. Her plan, like some of her predecessors', also includes targeted benefits for caregivers, surviving spouses and college and vocational students with a parent who has a disability or has died.

The combination of targeted and across-the-board benefits would reduce the number of seniors in poverty by almost 5 million while also helping many younger and better-off beneficiaries. To pay for these benefits and extend the solvency of the program, Warren would impose a slightly higher payroll tax rate on earnings over $250,000 and tax investment income received by high-income taxpayers. Warren's plan shares some features with an earlier proposal by Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Peter DeFazio that would scrap the cap for earnings above $250,000 and tax investment income in order to raise benefits by 5% for average retirees and more for low earners.

Both of these plans would improve Social Security's finances and restore some of the benefits Congress cut in 1983, when Social Security was facing an imminent funding crisis. Behind these commonalities are differences in emphasis. Larson's plan would eliminate the entire 75-year projected shortfall but provide more modest benefit increases. Warren's plan would provide bigger and more progressive benefit increases, but would only extend the system's solvency through 2054.

The latest tactic used against expansion is feigning concern for the economy. Expanding Social Security, some claim , would slow the economy by discouraging work and redistributing income from higher-income households (who save) to lower-income households (who spend), thus supposedly starving business, government and households of funds needed for investment. But as we pointed out in a critique of a Penn Wharton Budget Model analysis, taxing earnings has an ambiguous effect on work effort. And raising the income of beneficiaries increases consumer demand and boosts economic growth except when the economy is already operating at full employment.

Though the unemployment rate is historically low today — which in the past might have signaled an economy running at capacity and threatening to overheat — people are still entering the workforce at a healthy clip, blunting upward pressure on wages and prices. Many prominent economists argue persuasively that the biggest macroeconomic problem we face in the 21st century isn't a lack of investment capital or willing workers, but a global savings glut and chronically weak spending. As John Maynard Keynes and other economists have long recognized, what might be prudent for the individual can harm the economy if it saps consumer demand for goods and services.

Without Social Security and other pay-as-you-go social insurance programs that reduce the need for private saving and modestly favor low-income beneficiaries, interest rates would have to be negative to prevent the economy from contracting, wrote former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers in The Washington Post last spring. In other words, Social Security isn't dragging down the economy, it's helping keep it afloat.

Reasonable people can differ about how to bolster Social Security's finances, but either of the plans currently before Congress would leave future retirees — and the economy — much better off."

The comment appears to be directed at Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard , who has been accused of being cozy with Russia in the past.

""I'm not making any predictions, but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,"" Clinton said, speaking on a podcast with former Obama adviser David Plouffe. ""She's the favorite of the Russians.""

Clinton never names Gabbard, but there are only five women running for President -- Gabbard, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and author Marianne Williamson -- and none of the other woman have been accused of being boosted by Russia.

Clinton did not provide proof about how Russia is ""grooming"" Gabbard. She and her team pointed to allegations that Russian news and propaganda sites often report on Gabbard's campaign and that moments in Gabbard's campaign have been reportedly amplified by trolls and bots on Twitter with ties to Russia. Gabbard has denied those allegations.

""They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far,"" Clinton said.

Clinton's team also noted that some of Gabbard's foreign policy views align closely with Russian interests.

Gabbard responded on Twitter Friday afternoon to Clinton's comments.

""Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain,"" she tweeted.

""From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a concerted campaign to destroy my reputation,"" she added. ""We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know — it was always you, through your proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose.""

""It's now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don't cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly.""

Responding to Gabbard's attacks, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said, ""Divisive language filled with vitriol and conspiracy theories? Can't imagine a better proof point than this.""

Asked earlier if the former secretary of state was referring to Gabbard in her comment, Merrill told CNN, ""If the nesting doll fits.""

""This is not some outlandish claim. This is reality,"" Merrill said. ""If the Russian propaganda machine, both their state media and their bot and troll operations, is backing a candidate aligned with their interests, that is just a reality, it is not speculation.""

On Friday evening, after Clinton's comments drew considerable criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, Merrill backed away from the former secretary of state's allegation, tweeting, ""She doesn't say the Russians are grooming anyone. It was a question about Republicans.""

Gabbard, in a late August interview with CNN, ruled out a third-party bid.

""I will not,"" the Hawaii Democrat told CNN. ""No, I have ruled that out.""

Gabbard has tried to fight off the charge that she is being pushed by Russian interests.

""Just two days ago, the New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears,"" Gabbard said, referring to a recent story that said she is being backed by Russians on Twitter. ""This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.""

Clinton also accused Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate in both the 2012 and 2016 elections, of being a ""Russian asset.""

""That's assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not, because she's also a Russian asset,"" Clinton said. ""Yes, she's a Russian asset, I mean, totally. They know they can't win without a third-party candidate.""

Stein's campaign, which earned nearly 1.5 million votes in the 2016 election, was part of Russia's meddling efforts, according to a host of congressional reports, including a Senate Intelligence Committee report that indicated Russian social media efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election included messaging in support of Stein.

summation of the report's findings on ""comprehensive anti-Hillary Clinton operations"" said while the group's assumed Twitter personas had some pro-Clinton content, ""the developed Left-wing Twitter personas were still largely anti-Clinton and expressed pro-Bernie Sanders and pro-Jill Stein sentiments.""

Stein, who had dinner with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2015, has also compared Russian interference in the 2016 election to American overseas efforts.

""I think it would be naive to think that Russia did not try to interfere."" But, she said, ""Certainly that's what the United States does,"" though she added, ""that's not to justify it.""

""Interference is wrong and it's an assault against democracy, and it should be pursued, but (the United States) should pursue it knowing that we do it, too.""

In November, GM announced plans to close Lordstow… [+3637 chars]","The deal to end the month-long strike at General Motors will not save an assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, and two other transmission plants, according to a person familiar with the agreement.",2019-10-17,CNN,Deal to end GM strike won't save Lordstown plant,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/17/business/gm-strike-uaw-lordstown-plant/index.html,"Detroit (CNN Business) The deal to end the month-long strike at General Motors will not save an assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, and two other transmission plants, according to the United Auto Workers union.

In November, GM announced plans to close Lordstown as well as transmission plants in Warren, Michigan, and Baltimore, Maryland and Hamtramck, in Detroit. Under the proposed labor deal reached Wednesday, Hamtramck will get a new lease on life, with a chance to build electric trucks. But the company was offering that even before the union went on strike on Sept. 16.

""It is with sadness that, with this agreement, three of those four facilities will close,"" said the union's summary of the deal's terms.

The union said it did win enhanced retirement and buyout packages for affected employees. It also disclosed that GM plans to close a parts distribution center outside of Los Angeles sometime during the life of this contract. It has 31 hourly workers.

During contract negotiations, the United Auto Workers union had demanded GM bring some of the trucks it builds in Mexico to the US plants.

There were more than 3,000 union jobs at the four plants when plans to close them were announced in November. GM said it found jobs for about 2,300 of the workers at the four plants, although many had to relocate

On Thursday morning a group of workers from Lordstown were outside the meeting room where union officials were considering the proposed four year contract deal . They were chanting ""No product, no vote,"" to union officials as they entered the room, trying to push them one last time to demand that GM bring back a vehicle to build in Lordstown.

""It's depressing because so many people depend on it, and so many people left the community with the thought in their mind that, you know what? Our union's strong and our union's going to get us back to work in Lordstown one day,"" said Tommy Wolikow, a former Lordstown worker.

Wolikow is still with GM, having transferred to a GM plant in Flint, Michigan not long before the Lordstown plant stopped building cars. He said many workers from Lordstown who moved to other states to take GM jobs left their families behind, but did so with the expectation that they would be able to move back to Lordstown to be with their families again.

""To hear this news that we might not get another General Motors product, it's just devastating,"" he said.

A striking member of the UAW outside the Lordstown, Ohio, plant on the first day of the strike. Despite hopes of some employees, the deal to end the strike will not revive the plant that halted production in March.

The 32-day walkout by 50,000 GM workers centered on issues including a path to permanent work for temporary workers, pay raises or lump sum payments for UAW members and promises of investment at US plants.

GM agreed to eventually start building a new electric truck at the Hamtramck assembly plant, the company's last remaining plant within Detroit city limits. But GM has yet to reveal a prototype of the truck, known as a concept vehicle in industry parlance.

That means construction of the truck is likely more than a year in the future. Since GM plans to halt production of the sedans it now builds at Hamtramck early next year, the plant will likely be dark for an extended period.

GM also agreed to invest in some new plants in the Lordstown area, including one that would build lithium ion batteries to power electric cars. And it is looking at a possible sale of the Lordstown plant to a company that may build electric vehicles there. But it is not clear how many jobs those plants will produce, and they are unlikely to pay what veteran autoworkers at GM now earn.

The tentative agreement needs the approval of both union leadership as well as the rank-and-file union members at GM before it can take effect. The union's National GM Council, made up of those who represent GM workers nationwide, was meeting to consider the agreement Thursday."

Warren – who claimed to possess Native American heritage, Cherokee, specifically, over the course of her academic career – deleted the infamous tweet announcing the results of her DNA test after PJ Media columnist Jim Treacher wrote a post titled, “Happy Anniversary to Elizabeth Warren’s DNA Test!” on Tuesday:

SHARE SO IT LIVES FOREVER: pic.twitter.com/jeHQPynzic — Benny (@bennyjohnson) October 16, 2019

The DNA results did not bode well for Warren, despite her initial victory lap. The results showed that she possessed between 1/64th and 1/1024th Native American ancestry, or between 0.1 percent to 1.56 percent. Additionally, the results indicated that Warren’s minuscule Native American links were not associated with tribes in the United States, further casting doubt on her claims of Cherokee heritage.

President Trump pounced on the results.

“Pocahontas (the bad version), sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren, is getting slammed,” he wrote on October 16, 2018.

“She took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be 1/1024, far less than the average American. Now Cherokee Nation denies her, ‘DNA test is useless.’ Even they don’t want her. Phony!” he added:

Now Cherokee Nation denies her, “DNA test is useless.” Even they don’t want her. Phony! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2018

“A DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship,” Cherokee Nation Secretary of State Chuck Hoskin Jr. said. “Current DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person’s ancestors were indigenous to North or South America”:

Using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong. It makes a mockery out of DNA tests and its legitimate uses while also dishonoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens, whose ancestors are well documented and whose heritage is prove. Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage.

The results followed Warren’s years of false Native American claims. She listed herself as a minority professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and Harvard Law School and claimed Native American heritage on her Texas Bar registration card.

She continued to tout false claims of Native American heritage into her 2012 senatorial bid, telling a reporter that she had pictures that reflected her Native American heritage but added, “I have plenty of pictures. They’re not for you,” leaving the purported evidence shrouded in mystery:

That same year, Warren told the story of her parents, claiming that her father’s parent’s disapproved of her mother because she – as Warren claimed – was part Cherokee and Delaware.

“If your family heritage had an African American like you have, the grandfather or great grandparent who was a Cherokee, would you call yourself a black, and expect African Americans to accept that?” New England Cable News’s Jim Braude asked Warren.

“If that same ancestor was black and not Cherokee,” he added.

“If my Father’s parents had said, ‘You can’t marry her because she’s black, and that had been part of our family growing up, that we had two different families?” Warren said.

“You would be comfortable with saying you’re black?” Braude asked.

“It would be part of identification,” Warren quipped:

Elizabeth Warren says her parents had to elope because she was part Cherokee and part Delaware. This entire situation is worse than I had thought. pic.twitter.com/E87HDB3Qqo — 🌹 (@AlytaDeLeon) September 28, 2019

While Warren has failed to offer an explicit and thorough explanation for her years of misleading claims, she has vaguely apologized for making a “mistake” and admitted that she is “not a person of color” and “not a citizen of a tribe.”

“Like anyone who’s been honest with themselves, I know that I have made mistakes,” Warren said at the Native American Presidential Forum in Sioux City, Iowa, in August. “I am sorry for harm I have caused”:

Warren’s campaign deleted the results of her DNA test from her campaign website in August."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is making strides with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and is expected to meet with the group’s fundraising arm, making her and Joe Biden the only Democrat 2020 candidates to do so, according to Axios.

Warren is expected to meet with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) Bold PAC on Thursday, following what many consider to be a solid debate performance on Tuesday evening.

According to Axios, much of the discussion will revolve around immigration reform – a topic that was virtually ignored at the CNN/New York Times-hosted Democrat debate in Westerville, Ohio.

“We want to make sure whoever the nominee is doesn’t waffle on this,” Bold PAC political director Gisel Aceves said, according to Axios.

“Our members are acutely aware of how important and consequential this election is obviously to the country, but also how the Hispanic community has been attacked by this administration,” Aceves added.

While some of the 38 CHC Bold PAC members have endorsed a 2020 candidate, the caucus as a whole has not. The fundraising wing has only met with one other candidate: former vice president Joe Biden. He reportedly met with the CHC Bold PAC during the summer, around the same time he was dominating national polls. However, the political landscape has drastically shifted since their meeting in July, with Warren steadily making her way to the top and leading Biden in several national and early primary and caucus state polls.

The Massachusetts senator has broadly outlined her vision for immigration reform, expressing support for a full open borders policy at the U.S.-Mexico border and vowing in a tweet this month to stop “unnecessarily” detaining illegal border crossers:

Too many immigrants have died in ICE custody. We need to ensure asylum seekers are welcomed, treated humanely, receive the medical care they need, and are not detained unnecessarily. I have a plan to rebuild a more humane immigration system. https://t.co/v3OZZHeGPd — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 3, 2019

As Breitbart News reported:

Warren’s statement came in response to a report that a Cameroon national detained by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency had died while in custody. Unmentioned, though, is that migrant deaths under the Trump administration are 20 percent lower than the rate of migrant deaths under former President Obama.

Warren’s essential call for open borders follows the speech she delivered to the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) union in September. She, inexplicably, told union members that granting amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants currently residing in the United States would be “good for all workers,” even though the move would “immediately drive up foreign competition in the labor market for America’s working and blue-collar class,” as Breitbart News noted.

“We need a pathway to citizenship for the people who are here and here to stay. They are our neighbors; they are our brothers and sisters. They are here,” Warren said during the speech.

“We need a path — not just for DREAMers — but also a path for grandmas, and for little kids, and for people who came here to work on farms, and for students who overstayed their visas. We need a path that is fair and achievable. Bring people out of the shadows,” she continued.

“It is good for all workers, and we need to get them into our unions,” she added."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Joe Biden (D) in head to head matchups in the Hawkeye State, Iowa Emerson College poll results released this week show.

The poll – taken October 13-16, 2019, among 888 registered voters in Iowa – showed the president leading both Warren and Biden in hypothetical general election matchups in Iowa, besting both candidates 51 percent to 49 percent.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), however, appeared to hold an advantage in a hypothetical matchup, leading the president by two points– 51 percent to Trump’s 49 percent. The margin of error is +/-3.2 percent, indicating that the race is in flux:

Sanders’ lead against the president comes in spite of the fact that he is not leading the Democrat field in the Hawkeye State. Rather, Warren and Biden are tied with 23 percent support each, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who garnered 16 percent support. Sanders fell to fourth place with 13 percent support, followed by Andrew Yang (D), Gov. Steve Bullock (D), and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with five percent, four percent, and three percent, respectively.

The results outlined the most trouble for Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who has tried to revive her floundering campaign by focusing on Iowa.

As Breitbart News detailed:

Harris signaled a switch in campaign strategies in September, telling a colleague that she is “f*cking moving to Iowa.” “‘I’m f*cking moving to Iowa’ – Kamala Harris,” read an email following the presidential hopeful’s quip. “She cut to the chase!” the email stated. “We’re doubling our organizers on the ground in Iowa and Kamala is ramping up her time on the trail there, beginning today in Cedar Rapids.” The following month, Harris launched her “I feel your pain” tour across Iowa, which featured the presidential hopeful speaking to Iowans in more “intimate” settings, even helping some “prepare Sunday suppers.”

Despite those efforts, she was only able to garner two percent support in the state, alongside Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and Tom Steyer (D):

The poll also showed that more Iowans oppose impeachment than support it, 48 percent to 42 percent:

IOWA POLL: Do you support or oppose #Impeachment of @realDonaldTrump? 48% Oppose

42% Support

10% Unsurehttps://t.co/CIjFwBESSE — Emerson Polling (@EmersonPolling) October 17, 2019

Impeachment does not appear to be a top priority among Iowans across the board, with only six percent considering it an important factor in choosing whom to support for president. Thirty-three percent said the economy, 19 percent said health care, and ten percent chose “social issues.”

“The Democrats have some work to do in Iowa convincing voters that impeachment is a top priority of Congress; 67% of Democrats in Iowa support impeaching the president, but only 10% identify it as the most important issue in deciding their vote for president,” Emerson Polling Director Spencer Kimball said."

Trump's response: ""He didn't say that at all.""

While we can't know what Erdogan might have told US officials in private, his public comments were unequivocal.

Trump's inaccurate denial was one of at least 12 false claims he made to reporters during an Oval Office meeting and subsequent joint press conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella.

Here's what we found:

The troops and Syria, part 1

Touting his decision to remove troops from northern Syria, Trump said, ""We're bringing our soldiers back home, and we've done a great job.""

Facts First: The soldiers are not being brought ""home,"" at least not yet. Trump : The soldiers are not being brought ""home,"" at least not yet. Trump announced Monday that ""United States troops coming out of Syria will now redeploy and remain in the region to monitor the situation and prevent a repeat of 2014, when the neglected threat of ISIS raged across Syria and Iraq."" He also announced last week that 1,800 more troops would be deployed to Saudi Arabia.

The troops and Syria, part 2

Trump said that the US military deployment to Syria was initially supposed to last just ""one month.""

Facts First: There was never any specific timeline for the US military's involvement in Syria, much less a timeline of a mere 30 days.

""There was never a 30-day timetable on the US presence in Syria,"" said Syria expert Steven Heydemann, a professor of government and director of the Middle East Studies program at Smith College. ""The previous administration, and officials serving in this administration, have never offered a fixed timetable for the US mission. Official statements have emphasized that the presence of US forces would be short, limited in scope, and small. But beyond general comments along those lines, there has been no statement indicating it would end after 30 days.""

The Ukraine conspiracy

Trump repeated his debunked allegations about a Ukrainian conspiracy related to the Democratic National Committee computer servers that were hacked in 2016.

""Where is the server? I want to see the server. Let's see what's on the server. So the server, they say, is held by a company whose primary ownership individual is from Ukraine. I'd like to see the server,"" he said.

Facts First: Trump appeared to be referring to : Trump appeared to be referring to CrowdStrike , a publicly traded cybersecurity firm that was hired to investigate the hack of DNC servers in 2016. The company was co-founded by Dmitri Alperovitch, an American citizen who was born in Russia, not Ukraine . There is no evidence that any physical DNC server is currently being ""held"" by CrowdStrike; such companies do not typically take possession of the actual servers to conduct their analysis.

CrowdStrike -- which, like former special counsel Robert Mueller, attributed the hack to Russia -- said in a previous statement: ""With regards to our investigation of the DNC hack in 2016, we provided all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI. As we've stated before, we stand by our findings and conclusions that have been fully supported by the US Intelligence community.""

The company has been hired by Republicans as well as Democrats. It has been paid during Trump's presidency by the National Republican Congressional Committee and National Republican Senatorial Committee, public records show.

The whistleblower

Trump claimed again that the whistleblower who filed a complaint about his July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was inaccurate, saying, ""The whistleblower's report was totally wrong. The whistleblower didn't know what he was talking about or was given false information or was even worse than that.""

Facts First: As we've : As we've explained repeatedly, the whistleblower's account of the call was proven highly accurate by the rough transcript released by the White House.

Stock market ownership

""If you look at people's stocks, their 401(k)s, if you look at anything you want to look at, they're far better off now than they probably ever have been in this country. Record stock markets. And don't forget, stock market is not just rich people. It's all people. Because all people own in the stock markets,"" Trump said.

Facts First: Trump was right that it's not only rich people who own stocks, but it's not true that ""all"" people own stocks. Roughly : Trump was right that it's not only rich people who own stocks, but it's not true that ""all"" people own stocks. Roughly half of Americans owned stocks as of 2017, according to academic studies and polls.

Wealthy people own a disproportionate share of stocks. A 2017 paper by New York University economist Edward Wolff found that the top 10% of households owned 84% of stocks in 2016.

The Soviet Union's ""downsizing""

Warning of the perils of getting involved in unwinnable wars, Trump said, ""You know, Russia was involved in Afghanistan. It used to be called the Soviet Union -- now it's called Russia for a reason. Because they lost so much money in Afghanistan that they had to downsize. A very big downsizing.""

Facts First: This was an exaggeration. Experts say the Soviet Union's failed war in Afghanistan was far from the only reason for its collapse, though it did contribute to it. (We'll ignore Trump's use of the term ""downsizing"" to describe the dissolution of the Soviet Union.) You can read a longer fact check : This was an exaggeration.

(We'll ignore Trump's use of the term ""downsizing"" to describe the dissolution of the Soviet Union.) You can read a longer fact check here

""Corruption""

Trump recited his usual complaints about how he was treated by US intelligence officials involved in investigating his campaign's relationship with Russia, including former FBI Director James Comey and former deputy director Andrew McCabe. This time, he accused former President Barack Obama of being involved in the supposed ""corruption.""

""There was a lot of corruption. Maybe it goes right up to President Obama. I happen to think it does,"" Trump said.

Facts First: There is simply no evidence of Obama corruption.

Military spending

Trump said, ""I spent $2.5 trillion over the last almost three years rebuilding our military.""

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. As noted by Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, total defense spending for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 was $2.05 trillion -- and that includes more than three-and-a-half months of Obama's tenure, since the 2017 fiscal year began in October 2016.

Harrison said he thinks Trump must have been including military funding for the 2020 fiscal year to get to ""$2.5 trillion"" figure -- but the 2020 fiscal year has just started, and ""the actual appropriations bills for FY20 are still pending in Congress.""

The nuclear arsenal

Trump said of the US nuclear arsenal: ""Our nuclear has been totally updated and in some cases new.""

Facts First: Experts say that Trump has not yet implemented significant changes to the US nuclear arsenal. ""I am not aware that Trump can claim to have done anything for the state of the nuclear arsenal -- but nothing urgent needed to be done anyway,"" said Scott Kemp, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Nuclear Security and Policy, who served as a State Department adviser on arms control early in the Obama administration.

You can read a longer fact check here

NATO contributions

Trump took credit for NATO member states increasing their defense spending, saying that Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg is ""going around saying that President Trump was able to raise over $100 billion last year, which is true.""

Facts First: This is at least a slight exaggeration -- and one Stoltenberg gently tried to correct when he met with Trump in April. Though Stoltenberg has indeed given Trump credit for pressuring NATO countries into boosting spending, he has said, to Trump and in other forums, that the extra $100 billion the countries will spend on their own militaries will come : This is at least a slight exaggeration -- and one Stoltenberg gently tried to correct when he met with Trump in April. Though Stoltenberg has indeed given Trump credit for pressuring NATO countries into boosting spending, he has said, to Trump and in other forums, that the extra $100 billion the countries will spend on their own militaries will come by the end of 2020 , not that it happened ""last year.""

Democrats and borders

As usual, Trump claimed of Democrats, ""They want open borders.""

Facts First: Even 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests.

Here are some claims we can't definitively call false at the moment but are either dubious or require more context:

Facebook and the election

Trump appeared to refer to a flawed study that dubiously alleged that Google bias was sufficiently bad to have shifted at least 2.6 million votes away from Trump in the 2016 presidential election -- except he said somebody had found he lost two million votes or more ""because of Facebook.""

Facts First: The study in question was about Google in particular. While the author, Robert Epstein, did criticize Facebook in congressional The study in question was about Google in particular. While the author, Robert Epstein, did criticize Facebook in congressional testimony in July, he did not find that Facebook cost Trump 2 million votes.

Trump was vague here, saying that ""somebody"" said he had lost 2 million votes or more, so it is possible he was referring to something else. Regardless, there is no evidence for Trump's repeated claim that he was robbed of millions of votes in some manner or another.

The Kurds and ISIS prisoners

Trump expressed his hope that ISIS prisoners in Syria will continue to be guarded, accusing the Kurds of having ""opened up a couple doors to make us look as bad as possible"" and to ""create more havoc.""

Facts First: US officials : US officials told CNN last week that the Kurds have not intentionally released ISIS prisoners to embarrass the US. In a statement to Foreign Policy, the political wing of the Syrian Democratic Forces also denied having done so.

The SDF has had to remove troops guarding prisons and camps holding ISIS fighters and those displaced by the fight against ISIS.

""We already did not have professional jails or professional prisons to keep those prisoners in,"" SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said. ""The Turkish invasion to our region is going to leave a huge space, because we are forced to pull out some of our troops from the prisons and from the (displaced people) camps to the border to protect our people.""

Since it's at least possible Trump was referring to intelligence information not known to the public, we won't flatly declare that the claim isn't true. But no evidence has emerged to suggest it is.

Ammunition levels

Trump repeated a story he has been telling over the last week about the condition of the military early in his presidency.

""When I was thinking about having to do something,"" he said, ""one of our generals came in to see me and said, 'Sir, we don't have ammunition.' I said, 'That's a terrible thing you just said.' He said, 'We don't have ammunition.'""

Facts First: We can't be sure what a general might have privately told Trump, so we'll give Trump leeway to recount this supposed story without repeating the claim in his own words, but it's clearly not true that the world's most powerful military didn't have ammunition, period, when he was inaugurated in January 2017.

However, there are some real facts underlying the dubious tale. The US did have a shortage of certain precision-guided bombs at the time, according to military officials. You can read our full fact check here

The WTO decision

Trump took credit for a World Trade Organization decision to give the US permission to impose $7.5 billion in tariffs on European products in response to European subsidies to airplane manufacturer Airbus.

""Nobody else but me would have gotten that $7.5 billion back for the taxpayers of the United States,"" Trump said."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is topping presidential rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in support among Democrat college students, the latest College Pulse/Chegg Election tracker results show.

College Pulse and Chegg surveyedover 1,500 college students weekly in order to get a finger on the pulse of the presidential preferences of college students across the country. The results, based on Democrat and Democratic-leaning undergraduates, are updated once a week.

Students were asked, “Regardless of who you may support in the upcoming 2020 presidential election, who would you most like to be the Democratic nominee for President?”

The latest update, on October 15, showed Warren leaping to first place with 32 percent to Sanders’ 27 percent. This is significant, as Sanders has dominated as the frontrunner since the tracker’s formal launch in March. On March 26, Warren only had six percent support in the poll compared to Sanders’ 33 percent.

The “gender gap” on the two candidates is hitting an “all-time high,” according to College Pulse. Among female college students, Warren leads 34 percent to 27 percent, while Sanders leads among male college students with 31 percent to Warren’s 21 percent.

No other candidate comes close to Warren or Sanders, with Joe Biden (D) falling to a distant third with just ten percent support among Democrat and Democrat-leaning college students– a long fall from the 22 percent he garnered in March.

Andrew Yang (D) falls closely behind Biden with nine percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), Beto O’Rourke (D), and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), with seven percent, four percent, and three percent, respectively. The margin of error was not immediately available.

Harris’s three percent support marks an “all-time low” for the candidate,” College Pulse assessed.

The poll also found that the majority of college students, 54 percent, have an unfavorable view of Biden. Only 45 percent have a favorable view of the former vice president, whose role in the questionable foreign business dealings of his son has been a topic of controversy in recent weeks.

The vast majority of Democrat and Democrat-leaning college students, 89 percent, have a favorable view of Warren and Sanders, the survey showed."

A tax on the wealth of the richest Americans would raise far less money than its proponents claim and would likely exacerbate any problems with the wealthy exercising too much influence over politics, Summers said Thursday at an event at the Peterson Institute for Interna

Summers was Treasury Secretary in Bill Clinton’s administration and a top economic adviser to Barack Obama. That makes his critique of the wealth tax proposals from Warren and Sanders particularly relevant for Democrats.

Summers said the data put forth by a pair of economists, Berkeley professors Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, to support the case for a wealth tax is “substantially misleading” and “substantially inaccurate.”

He argued on Thursday that it was likely that the wealthy could avoid much of the tax by spreading their wealth around to relatives and by donating it to organizations that would pursue their goals. This could increase their political influence because some of those organizations would likely lobby for policies their donors approve of, Summers said.

“If you had a successful wealth tax that forced people to react the way they normally would by giving away their money to organizations that share their values and spent money in pursuit of their values, you would in all likelihood increase, rather than decrease, the influence of the views of the wealthy,” Summers argued.

Warren has proposed a 2 percent tax on wealth that exceeds $50 million, and 3 percent on the amount above $1 billion.

“The arguments around political power have almost no validity,” Summers said. “The truth is you can become one of the most powerful money people around the Democratic Party or the Republican Party for four or five million dollars a year. Nothing in this world is going to be able stop the wealthiest people in America from being able to come up with a vast multiple of that.”"

So the story from Biden goes, gangster “Corn Pop” represented a serious threat to Biden when he was a lifeguard at a community pool. Corn Pop, who actually was real, supposedly carried a straight razor and after an altercation with young lifeguard Biden threatened to meet him in the parking lot later—so young Biden claims he threatened to wrap a chain around Corn Pop’s head.

The whole blowup was over Biden allegedly calling Corn Pop “Esther,” a derisive insult drawn from the swimmer Esther Williams that apparently was akin to calling the gangster a girl. But before things devolved into a razor-versus-chain race war in the parking lot later, Biden says he apologized to Corn Pop for the insult, which defused the situation—and the incident has become part of Biden’s political folklore storyline of being a grand negotiator who can calmly lead in tense political situations, especially those involving race.

Though it seems an incredible story, Biden included it in his 2007 autobiography and it was a central part of a dedication ceremony at a Delaware public pool at which Biden spoke in 2017. The NAACP even confirmed the details of Corn Pop and his existence for those questioning it.

So when moderator Anderson Cooper at the end of the CNN-New York Times debate on Tuesday night closed down the debate with a question about a unique and different friendship that has shaped their lives, one would have thought the moderators were teeing Biden up for a perfect Corn Pop moment.

Cooper said:

Last week, Ellen DeGeneres was criticized after she and former President George W. Bush were seen laughing together at a football game. Ellen defended their friendship, saying, we’re all different and I think that we’ve forgotten that that’s OK that we’re all different. So in that spirit, we’d like you to tell us about a friendship that you’ve had that would surprise us and what impact it’s had on you and your beliefs.

Cooper went to all 11 other candidates before getting to Biden, who closed it down at the end, giving Biden plenty of time to think about what he was going to say.

Instead of telling the story of Corn Pop, Biden opted for a more conventional and boring answer, and one already used by several of the other candidates: He talked about his friendship with the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ):

This is reassuring in the fact that we’re all acknowledging that we have to reach across the aisle, get things done. No other way to get anything done in this country. The two people maybe would surprise you the most were — he’s been mentioned twice, but John McCain. John McCain worked for me when he worked in the Navy, and he was — he was my assigned to me to travel around the world. We became close friends. He became very close friends with my wife, Jill. Visited our home. He was there with his children. And on his death bed, he asked me to do his eulogy. John, I would say to John, ‘John, you didn’t see a war you never wanted to fight.’ And he’d say, ‘You didn’t see a problem you never wanted to solve.’ But he was a great man of principle. He was honorable. He was honorable.

Biden finished with typical talking points from his stump speech about why he’s running for president—nothing remarkable, nothing outstanding, and nothing memorable.

Some pundits and observers on Twitter laughed about Biden leaving Corn Pop hanging in favor of the safer McCain story, mocking Biden for being unable to read the room.

Cooper: Who were your surprise friends Klobuchar: McCain

Harris: Rand

Bernie: McCain

Missed opportunity to invoke Corn Pop — Ellen McGirt (@ellmcgirt) October 16, 2019

While this is more of a lighthearted ribbing of Biden, in an unserious and comedic manner—Corn Pop probably was not the right story anyway for the question—it does illustrate a larger problem with the sliding campaign of the former Vice President.

He again had no major memorable positive moments on a crowded debate stage for the fourth month in a row. Donald Trump, Jr., President Donald Trump’s eldest son, mocked Biden’s lackluster performance in a tweet by noting that, at least this time in the Ohio debate, Biden’s teeth didn’t nearly fall out—as they almost did in the previous debate.

On the bright side, at least Joe’s teeth didn’t fall out this time! — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 16, 2019

It seems cruel, but Biden’s teeth did slip and nearly fall out of his mouth in a previous debate, and in a forum his eye exploded, bleeding on live television. Another candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), suffered a heart attack less than two weeks before this debate, pushing health questions–like whether any of these Democrats are actually healthy enough to run for and serve as president–to the forefront of Americans’ minds heading into Tuesday night. Moderators even asked several of the candidates about these concerns in Ohio’s debate.

This all comes as it has been revealed by just-released Federal Election Commission (FEC) campaign finance reports that Biden’s campaign spent more than he raised in funds last quarter, and he keeps slipping in polls behind rivals Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and now lags in the fundraising race as well.

The bigger story that broke during the debate news cycle in its immediate aftermath is Biden spent nearly $2 million more than he raised last quarter—he raised $15.7 million and spent $17.6 million—while he had less than $9 million cash on hand at the end of September. That puts him at less than Sanders’ $33.7 million, less than Warren’s $25.7 million, less than Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s $23.4 million, and even less than the $10.5 million that the flaming-out Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) had.

NEWS: Joe Biden has $8.98 million cash on hand Sanders: $33.7 million

Warren: $25.7 million

Buttigieg: $23.4 million

Harris: $10.5 million — Shane Goldmacher (@ShaneGoldmacher) October 16, 2019

At a burn rate like Biden’s running, with not much gas in the tank, the former Vice President could be in some serious trouble in attempting to remain near the front of the pack. He’s already lost his frontrunner status, as Warren has pulled ahead of him in most national polling and in almost every early and battleground state except in the South. CNN’s Chris Cillizza called Biden’s funding lapses a “bombshell” revelation multiple times in a post about the matter, writing that it represents a “SIREN” for Biden’s campaign.

Factor that together with burgeoning attacks on his son Hunter Biden’s business dealings from the White House and President Donald Trump, as well as a media beginning to be receptive to the criticisms, and Joe Biden has a tougher-than-ever road ahead. Hunter Biden’s interview earlier on Tuesday on ABC did his father no favors by most accounts, and even CNN and JournoList founder Ezra Klein of Vox are now saying there is something to all the questions swirling around him and that Democrats need to be prepared to deal with this.

CNN published a fact check after the debate contrasting Biden’s claims he never discussed Hunter’s business dealings with his son with Hunter’s claims he did discuss them with his father.

FACT CHECK: Joe Biden claims he never discussed Ukraine dealings with his son. But his son indicated otherwise. #DemDebate https://t.co/YMbj1PNtcE pic.twitter.com/boHZmIW3Eb — CNN (@CNN) October 16, 2019

Klein, meanwhile, laid out in a Vox article how Democrats are woefully unprepared on the Hunter Biden issue should Joe Biden win the nomination, urging Democrats to learn how to talk about it, even if they don’t want to discuss the problems. Klein wrote:

A few things are true about the Hunter Biden story. One is that there’s no evidence Joe Biden did what Donald Trump has accused him of doing: pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor to protect his son from investigation. But another is that Hunter Biden poses real problems for Joe Biden’s campaign, and if Democrats pretend otherwise, they’re making a mistake. Many Democrats consider raising the Hunter Biden question unfair to Joe Biden. Why should he have to answer for the legal actions of his adult son? But no one said politics was fair. And if Democrats avoid the issue, they can be certain Trump will not. Biden’s vulnerability here needs to be tested in the primary, when Democrats have other choices, rather than in the general, when they won’t.

The debate moderators and other candidates barely touched on Hunter Biden during the debate, and only to brush it aside as a non-concern. But Hunter Biden is hardly the only of Joe Biden’s problems after the debate on Tuesday.

There was a particularly memorable moment where, towards the end of the night, both Sanders and Warren extracted a pound of flesh from Biden from the left—significantly undermining his standing with Democrats.

Cooper asked Biden to respond to the broad visions of big, bold change that Warren and Sanders respectively have been laying out:

Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change. Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution. Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump?

Biden replied with a claim he is the only one who has gotten anything substantive actually “done” in Washington:

Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people, and I think a lot of what they have to say is really important. But, you know, Senator Warren said we can’t be running any vague campaigns. We’ve got to level with people. We’ve got to level with people and tell them exactly what we’re going to do, how we’re going to get it done, and if you can get it done. I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done, from the Violence Against Women Act to making sure that we pass the Affordable Care Act to being in a position where we, in fact, took almost a $90 billion act that kept us from going into a depression, making us — putting us in a position where I was able to end roe — excuse me, able to end the issue of gun sales in terms of assault weapons. And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who is going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how you’re going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade.

After a follow-up question from Cooper asking Biden to further specify exactly whom he said was being “vague,” he took a not-so-veiled shot at the Medicare-for-All vision put forward by Warren and Sanders.

Biden said:

Well, the senator said — she’s being vague on the issue of — actually, both are being vague on the issue of Medicare for all. No, look, here’s the deal. Come on. It costs $30 trillion. Guess what? That’s over $3 trillion — it’s more than the entire federal budget… If you eliminated the entire Pentagon, every single thing, plane, ship, troop, the buildings, everything, satellites, it would get you — it would pay for a total of four months. Four months. Where do you get the rest? Where does it come from?

That opened Sanders up to decimate Biden for “working with Republicans” to back endless wars in the Middle East and trade policies that hurt America’s working class:

Joe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what you also got done? And I say this as a good friend. You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA and PNTR, with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs. Now, let’s get to Medicare for all. Let’s be honest. We spend twice as much per person as do the people of any other major country on Earth. And the answer is, if we have the guts that I would like to see the Democratic Party have that guts, to stand up to the drug companies and the insurance companies and tell them that the function of health care is to guarantee care to all people, not to make $100 billion in profit.

After back-and-forth between Biden and Sanders in response to Sanders’ smack-down, Warren delivered another brutal blow to Biden. Warren’s reply focused on the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, with which she was intricately involved and for which she receives enormous credit among Democrats:

So you started this question with how you got something done. You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, don’t even try, because you will never get it passed. And sure enough, the big banks fought us. The Republicans fought us. Some of the Democrats fought us. But we got that agency passed into law. It has now forced big banks to return more than $12 billion directly to people they cheated. I served in the Obama administration. I know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it. In Congress, on the first day, I will pass my anti-corruption bill, which will beat back the influence of money and repeal the filibuster. And the third, we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight for the things that touch people’s lives.

Buttigieg, who had sparred all night with Warren, seemed to sense what was coming next for Biden and attempted to interrupt to spare the former vice president any more pain from the socialists on either side of him. But Biden didn’t take the life raft from South Bend’s mayor, opting instead to further engage with Warren on the 2008 financial crisis. Biden, after fighting the moderators to respond to Warren, attempted to take credit for whipping U.S. Senate votes for the legislation that created the CFPB.

“I agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes,” Biden said. “I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight, too.”

Big mistake for Biden, as evidenced by the leftists on Twitter ripping him for “yelling” at Warren, lecturing the former college professor on her subject of expertise and claiming she couldn’t have done it without his work whipping votes for her project.

The fight over the CFPB was my daily beat for basically a year. I don't remember Joe Biden being involved whatsoever. His adviser Jared Bernstein was a strong supporter but Biden was 100% AWOL.

That set Warren up for the line of the night, when Cooper gave the spotlight back to her to reply to Biden.

“I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law,” Warren said.

Holy crap, Elizabeth Warren responds with Joe Biden snapping at her about his role in getting votes for the CFPB by thanking Obama. Whoosh.#DemocraticDebatepic.twitter.com/dAOtNuLvAL — Erick Fernandez (@ErickFernandez) October 16, 2019

Warren thanking former President Barack Obama, but not Biden, was brutal to Biden. Obama has not endorsed his former vice president in the 2020 Democrat presidential primary, deliberately not supporting his one-time wingman. That void for Biden and lack of support from the Democrats’ most popular star, the former president—despite Biden’s best efforts to closely associate himself with Obama at every turn—cuts like a dagger into his support.

It raises all sorts of questions among Democrats, including most importantly about Biden’s electability, about why they should vote for Biden if Obama won’t even endorse and campaign with him. Making matters worse for Biden is that, the morning after this debate, Obama turned around and endorsed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s re-election north of the border—but still refuses to back his own former right-hand guy.

I was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President. He's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term. — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) October 16, 2019

“You did a hell of a job in your job,” Biden interrupted Warren’s answer.

“Thank you,” Warren coolly replied to laughter from the audience. She continued:

But understand this. It was a dream big, fight hard. People told me, go for something little, go for something small, go for something that the big corporations will be able to accept. I said, no, let’s go for an agency that will make structural change in our economy.

“And President Obama said, I will fight for that, and he sometimes had to fight against people in his own administration,” Warren continued before Biden interrupted her again.

“Not me!” Biden protested, as Warren refused to credit him with any involvement in the response to the financial crisis.

Warren kept plowing through her answer, ignoring Biden’s protests.

“We have to be willing to make good, big, structural change,” she said.

By Wednesday, Biden seems to have realized just how bad Tuesday’s debate was for his campaign, as before he even left Ohio he was out ripping Sanders and Warren to anyone in the press who would listen, accusing them of “playing Trump’s game and trying to con the American people.”

He ripped Sanders and Warren for not being able to explain how they would pay for their mass increases in government benefits and claimed both were disingenuous.

Meanwhile, the establishment media keeps playing up Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) as candidates they say had big nights, as Democrats desperately look for someone to be able to effectively counter Warren’s and Sanders’ socialist vision—all while establishment-favorite blasts from the past like former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the 2016 Democrat nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton are discussed as potential Democrat saviors from the leftist socialist abyss."

The Hill reported Friday:

Spending on private flights by Democratic presidential candidates soared over the past three months, from roughly $680,000 in the second quarter to more than $2.2 million in the third fundraising period of the year. Topping the spending list was former Vice President Joe Biden, who dropped about $924,000 on private air travel … South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg spent nearly $479,000 on private flights over the past three months, up from roughly $300,000 in the second quarter. And Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) used about $253,000 in campaign cash to charter flights, significantly more than the $17,000 she spent in the second quarter. The Democratic primary field’s leading progressives, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), also saw their private air travel spending swell in the three-month fundraising period. … Other candidates who dropped campaign cash on private flights include Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who spent about $40,500; Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who spent about $23,000; and former tech executive Andrew Yang, who spent just under $26,000.

Biden, Buttigieg, Harris, Sanders, Warren, Klobuchar, and Yang all support the “Green New Deal,” a plan introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) in February that calls for the elimination of fossil fuels by 2030. Of those listed above, only Bullock opposes the plan, calling it “resolution aspiration” at the second debate.

A typical private jet flight on a Cessna Citation XLS jet seating seven passengers would burn just under one ton of carbon per person — about 20% of the average annual global per capita consumption, and about one third of what the total annual per capita consumption of carbon ought to be, according to calculations by the Sierra Club in 2015.

During the Democrat debate on Tuesday, Biden and his two main competitors, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (D-VT), traded barbs about who was best prepared to be commander in chief and what sort of vision was required to defeat President Donald Trump. Warren, in particular, cited her tenure, pushing for creation of the CFPB as proof she knew how to use “executive authority” to further her political agenda.

Biden, who earlier in the debate claimed to be the “only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done,” attempted to counter the argument by highlighting his own role in the creation of the CFPB.

“I agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it,” the former vice president said. “So let’s get those things straight, too.”

Despite the rhetoric, however, official scheduling records from the Obama-era White House dispute Biden’s claims of having rallied support for the legislation. In fact, as the Intercept has reported, on the day of the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act—which created the CFPB—the former vice president’s schedule notes he was not on the floor of the U.S. Senate.

Records show that on the day the bill passed by a vote of 60-39, Biden only had one meeting with a member of Congress’s upper chamber, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC). It is unlikely, though, that Biden was attempting to sway Graham’s vote on the bill because, at the time, the senator was one of the bill’s leading opponents. Biden’s schedule for the rest of the day shows meetings regarding issues such as Iraq and the then-stimulus spending program, but nothing about Dodd-Frank:

Joe Biden told @ewarren: ""I went on the floor and got you votes."" Okay, well, here's his schedule from the day the CFPB passed. He wasn't in the Senate. So when did this happen? (Unless this 2 1/2 hour meeting with Lindsey Graham was a failed effort to win his vote.) pic.twitter.com/sdEund4cMZ — Ryan Grim (@ryangrim) October 17, 2019

As the Intercept noted, not only is there scant evidence to back up Biden’s claim of going to the “floor,” but several of those involved in Dodd-Frank’s passage also have no recollection of the former vice president playing a role. Former Rep. Brad Miller (D-NC), who helped author the bill, even went so far as to say he “cannot recall ever hearing” Biden’s name mentioned as Dodd-Frank moved through Congress:

I talked to Michael Barr once or twice, and had maybe a bootleg conversation or two with Eric Stein, whom I had known for almost 25 years but who was not approved to talk to Congress. I had no contact with Biden and cannot recall every hearing his name mentioned by anyone. — Brad Miller (@BMillRep) October 16, 2019

This is not the first time the former vice president has inflated his role in a particular event for political gain. As Breitbart News reported in August, Biden has repeatedly inflated his role in the civil rights movement of the 1960s."

Kamala Harris (D-CA) is tanking in Iowa – despite a switch in campaign strategies to blitz the state, sarcastically telling a colleague in September that she is “f*cking moving” to the Hawkeye State – Emerson Polling results released this week reveal.

The California senator has experienced a steady decline in both national and early primary and caucus state polls in recent weeks. The trend was seemingly sparked by Rep. Tulsi Gabbard’s (D-HI) pointed attack on Harris’s controversial prosecutorial record – jailing hundreds of people for marijuana violations and later making light of smoking marijuana – during the Democrat debate in July.

Harris signaled a switch in campaign strategies in September, telling a colleague that she is “f*cking moving to Iowa.”

“‘I’m f*cking moving to Iowa’ – Kamala Harris,” read an email following the presidential hopeful’s quip.

“She cut to the chase!” the email stated. “We’re doubling our organizers on the ground in Iowa and Kamala is ramping up her time on the trail there, beginning today in Cedar Rapids.”

The following month, Harris launched her “I feel your pain” tour across Iowa, which featured the presidential hopeful speaking to Iowans in more “intimate” settings, even helping some “prepare Sunday suppers.”

Despite the Iowa push, Harris continues to tank in the polls, with the latest Emerson Polling survey showing Harris garnering just two percent among Democrat caucus-goers in Iowa.

The poll, taken October 13-16, 2019 among 313 Democrat caucus voters, showed Joe Biden (D) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) topping the field with 23 percent support each. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) overtook Sanders for third place with 16 percent support to the Vermont senator’s 13 percent.

Andrew Yang (D) came in fifth place with five percent support, followed by Gov. Steve Bullock (D) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with four percent and three percent, respectively.

Harris, who once mocked Gabbard’s low poll numbers, tied with both the Hawaiian lawmaker and Tom Steyer (D), with two percent support. The margin of error is +/- 5.5 percent:

Harris mocked Gabbard following their contentious face-off in July’s debate, telling CNN’s Anderson Cooper:

This is going to sound immodest, but I’m obviously a top tier candidate, and so, I did expect that I would be on the stage and take hits tonight because there are a lot of people that are trying to make the stage for the next debate.

“Especially when people are at zero or one percent or whatever she might be at, and so, I did expect that I might take hits tonight,” she added, a direct reference to Gabbard:

Harris continues to struggle in national polls, dropping to fifth place with 5.2 percent in the current Real Clear Politics average, behind Biden, Warren, Sanders, and Buttigieg."

Tributes have been pouring in on social media, and several of the 2020 Democrat candidates remarked on the lawmaker’s unexpected passing.

Biden first used the phrase in late September when he snapped at a reporter who asked about President Donald Trump suggesting Ukraine look into allegations of corruption against him and his son, Hunter Biden.

“I know Trump deserves to be investigated. He’s violating every basic norm of a president,” Biden told Fox News Channel correspondent Peter Doocy.

“You should be asking him the question, why is he on the phone with a foreign leader trying to intimidate a foreign leader,” the former vice president continued. “Trump is doing this because he knows I will beat him like a drum. He’s using abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me.”

“Ask the right questions,” he then demanded of Doocy.

During Tuesday evening’s Democrat presidential debate, Biden once again made the pledge to beat President Trump “like a drum” while defending Hunter against accusations of nepotism and corruption related to his son’s work in Ukraine and China.

“My son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine,” Biden said. “The president and his thugs are lying. He doesn’t want me to be the candidate. If I’m the candidate, he knows I will beat him like a drum.”

While the t-shirt demonstrates the Biden campaign is confident it will win the Democrat party, it still has to fend off the insurgent campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who is leading the former vice president in several statewide polls.

Although the Biden has latched onto the phrase, it appears Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) used it in 2016 when (erroneously) predicting what then-Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton would do to then-candidate Trump in the general election.

“I’d hold my nose and vote for him but we’d get killed. Hillary Clinton would beat him like a drum,” he told CNN."

“We think people should be able to hear what politicians have to say,” said Zuckerberg. “I don’t think it’s right for tech companies to censor politicians in a democracy.”

However, more than one politician is still banned on Zuckerberg’s social network.

Laura Loomer, a Republican congressional candidate in Florida, was blacklisted by Facebook in May this year, with the social network branding her a “dangerous” individual. Her campaign is currently waging a defamation lawsuit against the tech company over the “dangerous” label, and recently filed an opposition to Facebook’s motion to dismiss the case.

Earlier in the year, Facebook also banned British right-wing activist Tommy Robinson, who went on to become a candidate for the UK Independence Party in the European Parliamentary elections last year (EXCLUSIVE: Facebook ‘Hate Agents’ List Includes British Candidates For European Election).

Zuckerberg did not mention either of these high-profile bans during his speech at Georgetown. Not did he mention the platform’s decision, in 2018, not to run a series of Republican and pro-Trump ads for the midterm elections of that year, including an ad from the Trump campaign addressing crime and illegal immigration.

In his speech, Zuckerberg indicated that he would not ban political ads in the future. “Banning political ads favors incumbents and whoever the media chooses to cover,” he said.

“While I certainly worry about erosion of truth, I don’t want to live in a world where people can only post content that tech companies judge to be true.”

The Facebook CEO’s comments come amid mounting pressure from Democrats, including the DNC, Elizabeth Warren, and the Biden campaign, to censor material from the Trump campaign drawing attention to corruption allegations against the former Vice President related to his dealings with the Ukrainian government.

Facebook has, so far, refused to cave in to this pressure.

Tuesday’s debate was the fourth this year among those Democrats angling to win their party’s presidential nomination, and the ratings were the lowest of the year, even when you add the 449,000 live streams.

Back in July, far-left CNN hosted the second debate of the year, a two-night event that drew 8.7 million and 10.7 million viewers, for an average of 9.7 million. This was also a massive drop-off from the previous debate.

In June, the first Democrat debate of the year, hosted by NBC, MSNBC, and Telemundo, drew 15.3 million viewers on night one and 18.1 million viewers on night two, for an average of 16.7 million.

I supposed you could argue that people are already losing interest in the presidential campaign. But with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) surging into first place against former Vice President Joe Biden, that doesn’t make much sense. There’s a real horse race happening among the Democrats. This is an election in flux where anything can still happen, so I doubt interest is waning.

The problem appears to be … CNNLOL.

The first and third debates were hosted by NBC and ABC, respectively, and garnered gonzo ratings: 16.7 million and 14 million.

The third and fourth debates, hosted by CNNLOL, resulted in a mammoth collapse in viewers, around a 40 percent drop: 8.7 million and 8.3 million.

For those of you who might be under the mistaken belief a cable channel like CNN cannot compete with broadcast outlets like ABC and NBC, that’s just not true.

To begin with, CNN is available in nearly 80 million households. Secondly, during the 2016 presidential campaign, 15.5 million viewers watched the first debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders on CNN.

CNN hosted a Republican debate during the 2016 primary that attracted 23 million viewers.

So, at one time, CNN was able to compete with the broadcast networks. But now Democrat primary voters are turning away in droves whenever one of their debates airs on the far-left cable channel.

CNN must be the problem.

What other explanation is there?

CNN is not only the lowest rated (by far) and least trusted of the cable news networks, it is also staffed by the least interesting anchors in the business. You don’t have to like MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow or Chris Matthews to find them interesting, to see they are real people with minds of their own. But as we are learning through the Project Veritas reporting, everyone at CNN is a Jeff Zucker clone, a puppet repeating his talking points, expressing his far-left beliefs. As a result, the network is now predictable and dull; one note and blah.

CNN has changed A LOT since the 2016 presidential campaign, since the days when it could actually compete with Fox News and the broadcast network for debate viewers, even Republican debate viewers.

But since Trump’s election, CNN has worked overtime to whore out its credibility, and has done so just because the fake news outlet is too immature to accept the results of the 2016 presidential election. And in doing so, CNN has allowed Zucker to cast a gray pall over the entire enterprise, which makes it lifeless, tedious, and boring.

If Democrats want to attract a serious number of eyeballs, and I’m sure they do, they need to dump CNN as a debate partner.

“Tuesday night’s debate was one more reminder that we are living through the death of the Democratic Party,” Gingrich declares, as we watch it mutate before our eyes into the “Democratic-Socialist Party.”

We are living in “a historic moment in which a once-great American party is transformed into an anti-American engine of radical change,” Gingrich observes. “In 2020, every Democratic candidate will be faced with the challenge of defending a national party which is now the Democratic-Socialist Party.”

In Tuesday’s debate, candidates were falling over each other to establish their far-left creds, leaving behind the platforms of the last two Democrat administrations as a vestige of relative moderation.

“Imagine that any candidate last night had had the courage (or lack of sense) to actively defend President Bill Clinton’s policies on welfare reform, capital gains tax cuts, balanced federal budgets, or his 1996 State of the Union assertion that ‘the era of Big Government is over,’” Gingrich muses.

The same goes for Barack Obama’s original 2008 position that “I believe marriage is between a man and a woman” or his stated opposition to “any limitation on the right to buy private insurance.”

“When the last two Democratic presidents are no longer defendable, something profound has happened,” Gingrich observes.

Imagine further that one of the candidates had said he or she were against abortion, Gingrich continues. “The result might have been a riot – and at a minimum an expulsion of the heretic.”

Or imagine if one of the candidates had argued that our schools “should not be centers of anti-American indoctrination dictated by left-wing unions,” he asserts. “They would be booed off the stage.”

Almost overnight the Old Democratic Party has given way to an almost unrecognizable radical caricature of itself, which is more and more overtly socialist and less and less democratic.

“Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is now the spiritual leader of House Democrats, and every major Democratic presidential candidate has endorsed radical Green New Deal-type proposals that would expand government, destroy the energy industry, radically change America, and plunge the economy into a depression,” Gingrich notes.

“The Democratic-Socialist Party wants to outlaw private health insurance, punish the successful (especially the wealthy), and expand government control over virtually everything,” he says.

Their proposals range from “wanting to confiscate guns” to “forcing the radical California gender curriculum in every state” to “removing the tax exception for every church, synagogue, and mosque that defines marriage as between a man and a woman,” he notes.

They also include providing taxpayer-funded health care to people living in the country illegally, open borders, and tax-paid sex-change operations in prison, he adds.

The dizzying pace at which the party has been revolutionized calls for thoughtful Americans to pause and ponder the historical significance of what is happening before our eyes, Gingrich suggests.

It is “a wrenching, defining moment for the party of FDR and JFK as it is conquered by the party of AOC, Sanders, and Warren,” he concludes.

As of Friday night, only 24 House Republicans have yet to cosponsor the bill. H. Res. 604 would condemn Schiff for reading a fictional phone call between Zelensky and Trump into the record.

Schiff also allegedly lied about having never spoken to the Ukrainian intelligence officer “whistleblower.”

Rep. Biggs wanted to force a vote on the legislation this week but delayed the move after House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-MD) passed away. The Arizona conservative will reportedly force the vote Monday night.

The legislation to condemn Rep. Schiff has quickly gained support from House GOP across the political spectrum. House Freedom Caucus conservatives, moderates, and House Republican leadership have all cosponsored the legislation.

Since Biggs introduced the legislation in late September, the bill quickly gained 18 cosponsors. Now, the bill features support from 88 percent of the House Republican Conference.

Texas and Hurricane Harvey

Touting the ""billions and billions of dollars"" in relief money he authorized for Texas in the wake of Hurricane Harvey in 2017 -- and teasing Texas lawmakers over their requests for him to spend more -- Trump said, ""You made a fortune on the hurricane.""

Facts First: Texas did not make money from Hurricane Harvey.

Harvey created costs of $125 billion, the federal government estimates. The government says Texas has been allocated $26.6 billion in federal disaster funds since 2017.

The Texas Department of Insurance estimated in April that personal and commercial insurance payouts related to Harvey would total $19.6 billion.

The Dallas Morning News described Trump's claim as a joke, but we don't think his intentions were clear enough to brush off the comment as comedy. Texas' Democratic Party did not find it funny, saying on Twitter : ""Texans lost everything after Hurricane Harvey. Shame on you, Donald Trump.""

Harvey rescues

Trump exaggerated the number of people rescued by the Coast Guard in response to Hurricane Harvey, saying, as he has before, that they saved ""16,000 lives.""

Facts First: The Coast Guard : The Coast Guard says the correct number is 11,022 people rescued.

The Bidens

Trump conflated his accusations against former Vice President Joe Biden and son Hunter Biden -- railing against Hunter Biden's business dealings, then saying that Joe Biden ""takes a billion-five"" from China and ""allows China to rip us off."" He added, ""So the Bidens got rich while America got robbed.""

Facts First: There is no evidence Joe Biden has received large sums of money from China or has otherwise gained wealth as a result of his son's business dealings abroad.

Trump has previously made the ""billion-five"" accusation against Hunter Biden. While a conservative author has used this figure , it has not been proven. A lawyer for Hunter Biden, George Mesires, says the investment company in which Hunter Biden has an equity stake was capitalized with a total of about $4.2 million at today's exchange rates, ""not $1.5 billion."" Even this investment was not a direct payment to Hunter Biden; Hunter Biden holds a 10% stake in the firm, Mesires says , and has not made a profit to date.

Obama and AIDS

Vowing to end the AIDS epidemic in the US within a decade, Trump said the Obama administration spent ""no money on that.""

Facts First: The Obama administration spent $10.8 billion on domestic HIV/AIDS research between the 2013 fiscal year and 2016 fiscal year alone, according to a The Obama administration spent $10.8 billion on domestic HIV/AIDS research between the 2013 fiscal year and 2016 fiscal year alone, according to a review by the Kaiser Family Foundation, and $85.1 billion more on domestic HIV/AIDS care, housing and prevention programs in those four years. It also spent $26 billion on international HIV/AIDS initiatives of various kinds over the same time period.

Democrats and undocumented immigrants

Trump noted that all of the 10 Democratic presidential candidates at a debate in June raised their hand to say they would extend health care coverage to undocumented immigrants, then claimed that the Democrats ""want to give more to illegal aliens than they give to American citizens.""

Facts First: This is false. The Democrats want to give these immigrants the same access to care that citizens have, not more.

The Turkey deal

Hailing his Thursday deal with Turkey, in which Turkey agreed to suspend military operations in northeast Syria for five days to allow Kurdish fighters to leave the area, Trump claimed that others had been unable to make a deal for 15 years or 20 years.

Facts First: Experts Experts told CNN that it is not true that previous presidents had sought any such deal. The deal was narrowly tailored to a Turkish offensive that only began this month; previous presidents had not sought to give Turkish forces control over a part of Syria; and Syria's civil war had not even begun 15 or 20 years ago.

The whistleblower

Trump said again that the whistleblower who complained about his dealings with Ukraine ""got it all wrong.""

Facts First: The whistleblower's The whistleblower's account of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was highly accurate -- as the rough transcript released by the White House confirms.

Schiff's comments

Trump suggested that he had ""caught"" Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff by doing ""the unexpected"" and releasing the rough transcript of the call, thus proving Schiff's exaggerated account of the call was inaccurate.

Facts First: Schiff delivered his rendition of the call the day after Trump released the transcript, not before. Trump initially recounted the timeline correctly, Schiff delivered his rendition of the call the day after Trump released the transcript, not before. Trump initially recounted the timeline correctly, then adopted this incorrect timeline

The Internal Revenue Service

Trump said, ""I will never allow the IRS to be used as a political weapon -- except in the case of myself, where they use it against me.""

Facts First: There is no basis for Trump's claim that he is allowing the IRS to be used against himself. The IRS is run by a Trump appointee, Charles Rettig, and there is no evidence it is being used against Trump; Democrats are seeking access to his tax returns, but that is not the same thing.

Pre-existing conditions

Trump repeated his promise to ""always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.""

Facts First: The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump is currently supporting a Republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of Obamacare void. He has not issued a plan to reinstate the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions if the suit succeeds.

Obama and judicial vacancies

Trump claimed that President Barack Obama left him ""142"" judicial vacancies.

Facts First: There were 104 vacancies on January 1, 2017, just before Trump was inaugurated, according to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments.

The history of judicial vacancies

Mocking Obama's record on appointing judges, Trump claimed that presidents before him were ""always"" left zero judicial vacancies to fill.

Facts First: According to Wheeler, there were 53 vacancies on January 1, 2009, just before Barack Obama took office; 80 vacancies on January 1, 2001, just before George W. Bush took office; 107 vacancies on January 1, 1993, just before Bill Clinton took office. So Trump had the most judges to appoint since Clinton, but, clearly, other presidents also had appointing to do.)

Veterans Choice

Trump took credit for passing the Veterans Choice program, saying that others had tried and failed to do so for almost ""50 years.""

Facts First: Obama signed the Choice program into law in 2014. Trump signed a law in 2018, the VA MISSION Act, to expand and change the program.

The unemployment rate

Trump exaggerated as usual on the impressive unemployment rate, saying it was the lowest in ""51 years.""

Facts First: The September The September rate , 3.5%, was the lowest since December 1969, just under 50 years ago.

Energy production

Trump claimed to have ended ""the war"" on American energy, then boasted of the US ""now"" being the world's ""number one production of oil and natural gas.""

Facts First: The US has not just ""now"" become the world's top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump's policies: it took the top spot The US has not just ""now"" become the world's top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump's policies: it took the top spot in 2012 , under the very president he has accused of perpetuating the""war."" The US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump's tenure.

Wind energy

Trump told his usual semi-comedic story about how, if ""windmills"" are used for energy as he said Democrats want, people's televisions will go out if the wind is not presently blowing.

Facts First: Democrats support the use of wind turbines. Using wind power as part of a mix of power sources does not cause power outages even when the wind isn't blowing, as the federal Department of Energy Democrats support the use of wind turbines. Using wind power as part of a mix of power sources does not cause power outages even when the wind isn't blowing, as the federal Department of Energy explains on its website. ""Studies have shown that the grid can accommodate large penetrations of variable renewable power without sacrificing reliability, and without the need for 'backup' generation,"" the Department of Energy says.

The World Trade Organization

Trump claimed the US did not win ""any cases"" at the World Trade Organization before he came along -- ""anything for years, practically.""

Facts First: Trump's own Council of Economic Advisers Trump's own Council of Economic Advisers noted in a February report that the US had won 86% of the cases it had brought since 1995. Like other countries, the US tends to win when it brings the cases, lose when cases are brought against it.

China's agricultural spending

Trump claimed China had never spent more than $20 billion in a year on US agricultural products.

Facts First: China spent $25.9 billion in 2012, according to figures from the Department of Agriculture.

The trade deficit with China

Trump claimed the US trade deficit with China has long been $500 billion per year.

Facts First: Through 2018, there has never been a $500 billion trade deficit with China. The 2018 deficit was $381 billion last year when counting goods and services, $420 billion when counting goods alone.

China and tariffs

Trump said again that his tariffs on imported Chinese products have ""cost us nothing,"" claiming China has ""eaten"" the cost.

Facts First: A bevy of economic studies have found that Americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs, and Americans make the actual tariff payments.

Mexican troops

Trump claimed that there are 27,000 Mexican soldiers ""on our border"" to help with migration issues.

Facts First: Acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan told reporters in September that 10,000 of the approximately 25,000 Mexican troops deployed were on Mexico's own southern border: ""They've created a new national guard within their country: 10,000 troops to the southern border; 15,000 troops to the northern border with the United States,"" he Acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan told reporters in September that 10,000 of the approximately 25,000 Mexican troops deployed were on Mexico's own southern border: ""They've created a new national guard within their country: 10,000 troops to the southern border; 15,000 troops to the northern border with the United States,"" he said

Defense spending

Trump claimed to have spent ""more than $2.5 trillion"" on the armed forces, increasing this number from the straight ""$2.5 trillion"" he had cited last week

Facts First: Defense spending for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 was $2.05 trillion, and that includes more than three-and-a-half months of Obama's tenure, since the 2017 fiscal year began in October 2016.

Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he thinks Trump must have been including military funding for the 2020 fiscal year to get to ""$2.5 trillion"" figure -- but since the 2020 fiscal year has just started, and Harrison noted that the defense appropriation has not yet been approved by Congress.

Democrats and borders

Trump claimed Democrats support ""open borders.""

Facts First: Even the most liberal of Democratic presidential candidates do not advocate unrestricted migration.

The wall

Trump said his wall on the Mexican border is ""going up rapidly.""

Facts First: As of September 30, no additional miles of border wall had been built during Trump's presidency in places where barriers had not existed before, according to a fact sheet from Customs and Border Protection. Over Trump's tenure in office, 69 miles of barriers had been constructed in places where ""dilapidated and outdated"" barriers had existed before; that's a pace of about half a mile of replacement barrier per week.

Democrats and the wall

Trump repeated his claim that ""almost"" all of the Democrats wanted a wall on the Mexican border five years ago.

Facts First: Democrats did support Republican demands for fencing in the comprehensive immigration reform bill six years ago, but that was fencing -- and Democrats agreed to endorse it only in exchange for Republican support for their own preferred policies, like a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

The crowd

Urging the fire marshal to let more supporters into the arena, Trump claimed that there were ""close to 30,000"" outside.

Facts First: Trump's estimate was not even close. ""We didn't have 30K outside. Probably had upward of 5K outside,"" Dallas Police Department spokesman Sgt. Mitchell Warren told CNN in an email."

The responses were humbling and show there are no easy answers.",2019-10-19,CNN,Opinion: Your pregnancy discrimination stories prove there are no easy answers,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/19/opinions/elizabeth-warren-pregnancy-discrimination-reader-response-carr/index.html,"(CNN) ""Back then, you had to be married for nine months before delivering your baby or your maternity insurance wouldn't kick in.""

That's what BJ, who was living in Connecticut in 1971 and working as a bank teller, remembers about her first pregnancy. After she started to show, she had to work at a back desk away from the customers, she writes. Now living in North Carolina, BJ is one of the hundreds of women and men who wrote to us after CNN Opinion invited readers to share their experiences with pregnancy discrimination. When thinking about her own life and those of her three daughters and their pregnancies, she said, ""We have come a long way.""

When it emerged that Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren may have faced job discrimination over a pregnancy, the backlash against the claim was swift. One reason Warren's story of pregnancy discrimination prompted such an outcry from Americans on social media earlier this month and from so many of you in response to our call for stories is that for many American women -- and men -- the Pregnancy Discrimination Act feels too much like a historical footnote and little else. The Act amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to ""prohibit sex discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbrth, or related medical conditions."" Before it was signed into law in 1978, it was perfectly legal to refuse to hire, or to fire, a woman because of pregnancy.

Women who, like BJ, were working parents in the 1960s and 1970s, described what it was like seeking work as a woman of childbearing years before 1978; they recalled having to show prospective employers their birth control pills or disclose the dates of their last period to prove they weren't pregnant or wouldn't try to get pregnant if hired. Other women shared heartbreaking stories with us, ones not consigned to the pre-1978 past. Companies denying benefits after a stillbirth, demanding employees return to work one week after delivery.

For those women, it might come as no surprise to consider that as recently as this year, federal courts have been called upon to adjudicate pregnancy discrimination cases; in 2015, UPS lost a pregnancy discrimination case before the Supreme Court (in a decision that united Ruth Bader Ginsburg with Samuel Alito, two justices with very different judicial worldviews).

As recently as 2007, Melanie K. -- who worked for a staffing company and was a 39-year-old mother herself -- reported a client telling her, ""Don't bring me any women who are going to have kids."" When she asked in disbelief for clarification, her client -- a national company seeking IT professionals-- reiterated: ""Avoid any woman of child-bearing age.""

Several years after Melanie's experience, Becca K., of Cleveland, recalled her boss's words to her when she returned from maternity leave after her second child. She needed to ""dial it back to basics while getting back into the swing of things"" because ""changing diapers for three months isn't the same thing as managing a multimillion-dollar business."" For Laura Astorino of Massachusetts, the comments came from a founding partner at the firm where she worked (and where she was told she couldn't have a raise since she was going on maternity leave): he called employees with children ""breeders.""

For women today, pregnancy discrimination is ""is real, it is harrowing, and it is wrong,"" wrote our op-ed contributor Kara Alaimo

These stories of pregnancy discrimination weren't just about pregnancy -- they were also about miscarriage. They were also about adoption. They were also about supporting a pregnant partner.

I was told by my CEO that I couldn't use any of my sick leave because I wasn't theoretically 'sick'. (I was pregnant with twins and would likely have a Cesarean.) I asked the CEO if a man who has back surgery is considered 'sick'. He backed down. — Linda Avey (@lindaavey) October 9, 2019

Angela from Oklahoma, wrote: ""I adopted my daughter at birth and I was basically told I wasn't going to get FMLA [12 unpaid weeks for employees who qualify under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993] for a decision I was making. However, the company policy would have allowed me to take time off if I had a drug problem, etc. Just not to take care of my child, because I CHOSE to have her, because I didn't give birth to her. I also CHOSE to leave that company.""

""She's taken full advantage""

In 1996, I was a 4th year attorney starting a new job with a well-respected boutique firm in Houston. On my first day, one of the named partners took me to lunch. As we were entering the elevator, a visibily pregnant woman was exiting and the partner introduced her to me as one of their associates. Once on the elevator, he snidely said to me, ""This is Catherine's third child. She's taken full advantage of our maternity leave program."" I've never forgotten that comment or his tone and it definitely was in mind when I had my first, and only, child a few years later while still at the firm. I felt pressured to do a fair amount of work remotely during my 3 months of leave, so as to not damage my chance at partnership, which I eventually got. Catherine never made partner and eventually left, as I did in 2007.

I'm due in January. Things need to change

In 2011, I discovered I was pregnant after starting a new job. I work in a male-dominated field, and my pregnancy seemed to confuse my male bosses. My employer's response was, ""I've been in this industry for 10 years and I've never heard of such a thing!"" I assure you, my reproductive system works the same way as any other woman's. They didn't want to work with me on appointments. They didn't understand why I needed to miss hours for glucose tolerance testing, an amniocentesis, my anatomy scan. They were upset I could no longer lift 50 pounds or more.

I live in a state that isn't really pro-women's rights. I'd been on the job for 6 months when I was placed on modified bed rest for the last 4 weeks of my pregnancy. My company kept my job open. However, when I finally delivered, I was expected to return to work just two weeks later. I had a difficult delivery, and my doctor wouldn't authorize a return to work until 8 weeks postpartum. I didn't qualify for FMLA.

I lost that position. I was a single parent. The loss of income was devastating. I had to put my children on Medicaid to insure them. We went on SNAP for a while. In the end, I spent 18 months as a stay-at-home parent, and I cherish that time. But I'd rather have been employed.

Now, in 2019, seven years later, I find myself in the exact same position. I started a new job and discovered I was pregnant. Nothing has changed. If anything, the current environment is even more hostile to mothers in the workplace. I work for a really good company, so that helps, but I still find myself with no job protection. I still don't qualify for FMLA. My state still has no provision for pregnant women. Health care costs have skyrocketed, and as have the costs of having a baby.

I'm due in January. Things need to change. This country is lacking in women's rights. Many mothers would love to stay home with their new baby for a year [as other countries mandate in terms of paid leave]. We simply can't afford to. At the very least, we need a maternity program that isn't dependent on how long you've been working. Let us collect Social Security during that time. If our employers can't afford to hold our jobs, which is especially hard for smaller companies, let us collect unemployment. Humanity literally depends on women having babies. It's time for this country to realize that.

Men are also punished

When my wife was pregnant with our third child, we had some significant health scares for the baby requiring weekly ultrasounds. I didn't miss more work than I had sick time, but I used my accrued sick leave to help take care of my wife and children when needed. When the opportunity for promotion came up, my supervisor told me that they needed someone more dependable and that because I had taken so much time off to care for my family, I wouldn't be eligible. (I also never took time off for this without finding someone to cover as well.) I am sure that it is worse for the women who are pregnant, but men who actually take time off for pregnancy/paternity leave are also punished.

Discrimination isn't the problem. Entitlement is

Having a child as a working parent is difficult. I know because I have two children. Both were delivered via Caesarian and I was fortunate to have eight weeks with each baby after delivery. Before deciding to have children, consideration was given to the time and effort required to raise a child. It became glaringly apparent that parenting would not come without sacrifice. Never did my employer indicate that pregnancy, nursing or parenting would impact my job. Had they suggested that, I would not have blamed them. I spent 9 months mostly in the office bathroom vomiting (pre-delivery) and a significant amount of time pumping when I returned from maternity leave. Guess what, my male cohorts didn't.

I am not denying that there are ignorant people out there, but I think the prevalent problem facing us is that of entitlement. We want to be successful career women, but don't want to sacrifice having children. We want to have children, but expect to be given advantages, excuses, for sub-par performance. The reality is that life is about choices. I have made mine after careful consideration. Lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine. This is my experience. Please consider it as valid before dismissing it because it doesn't align with your storyline.

Pregnant? You still have to lift a Labrador retriever

I worked as a veterinary technician and was told that while they understood I could no longer assist with X-rays, I was expected to continue lifting dogs up to 75 lbs by myself and that I would not be allowed extra breaks or time off during my pregnancy. I considered quitting, but felt certain that another veterinary establishment would choose not to hire me if they knew I was pregnant.

What it was like the year the Pregnancy Discrimination Act became law

In 1978, I was a 21-year-old female interviewing for my first management position after college. I remember, distinctly, making it to the final round of interviews with four different corporations in which the hiring manager doing the final interview was always a white male. In three of the four interviews, I was asked when I was planning to get married and have children. My response was I wasn't in a relationship and couldn't see that happening for many years to come. After convincing them my career was my priority, each of these men followed up with a sentiment similar to, ""Of course you understand why we have to ask that question. Training new management recruits and investing in their careers is expensive. If you were to go off and start having babies, you wouldn't be able to give us the same level of commitment."" I was offered a position with all four corporations; I accepted a position with the corporation that never approached that question.

You're forced to choose and live with the consequences

I was a married PhD student. When my dissertation director found out I was expecting my first child, he was furious. ""You can't have a baby AND write a dissertation. It can't be done,"" he said. I did both, but had even more resistance about being a new mom when I defended my dissertation -- this time by the women on my committee. Even though they teach, higher ed is NOT mom-friendly. And this was in 2006!

I had another discriminatory incident when I gave birth to my second child. I was adjunct teaching at the university level and had my course load cut in half when my second child was born. I was told the cut would only last a semester, to accommodate my schedule, but the program director never reassigned the courses next semester. So my salary was permanently cut in half. I knew something like that would happen, and came back to work 3 weeks after giving birth to try to protect my job. Obviously, that didn't work.

This is the reality for women in America's higher education system. You're forced to choose, and live with the consequences. I just don't understand why Warren's comment is even a question. It happens every day.

With a baby in the NICU, I lost my job

I went into the hospital with pregnancy complications at 29 weeks and was [put on] 24-hour bed rest. I delivered my daughter 6 weeks early at 34 weeks. I notified my employer of her birth per being told to a few days later. I was then informed that I only had 2 weeks of leave left and would need to return to work after or be terminated. They ran my short-term disability and FMLA concurrently without telling me so I used up 6 out of the 8 weeks while on bed rest. I asked if I could work from home because I physically couldn't come back in two weeks (C-section delivery). It was up to my supervisor to approve and he denied stating he didn't believe I would truly work. With a new baby in the NICU and fresh from surgery, I was terminated from my job.

I never forgot the fear I had from my first pregnancy

I am Elizabeth Warren's vintage. Interviewing for my first professional job In 1978, I was pregnant but did not disclose it. Part of the hiring process was passing a physical. I actually prayed it would not disclose the pregnancy, knowing I would not get hired. After many months of working to make myself indispensable (and still hiding my pregnancy), I told my manager I would need a maternity leave. Annoyed, he said if he'd known I was pregnant he would not have hired me. Nevertheless, he did not fire me and I returned to work after a six-week leave. Four years later, I again became pregnant. My manager was then a VP and I was then a director. By that time, it was assumed I would take a leave and return to work, which I did. But I never forgot the fear I had from my first pregnancy.

""You better not be pregnant""

I was working at a law firm in 2014 and was called into my boss' office and he inappropriately told me that another attorney had just told him she was pregnant, so his direct quote to me was, ""She is pregnant so you better not be."" He then went on to tell me that only one of us could be pregnant on the team at once and that we all better coordinate that. The truth was I had just found out the day before that I was pregnant and was then completely terrified. I unfortunately suffered a miscarriage with that pregnancy, but knew that I would never be able to have a healthy pregnancy at that office. I had seen them fire a pregnant woman and also fire a woman who came back to work post pregnancy who was then hospitalized for severe postpartum depression. She was fired while still out on leave for her postpartum. I had also been told that my career would be ruined if I got pregnant. Rather than continue my career as a law firm attorney and continue in that environment, I chose to take a corporate job where I remain today, happily the mom of 2.

I've been one of the ""lucky"" ones

I went for an interview at 10 weeks pregnant. I had 2 previous consistent miscarriages, so I didn't feel comfortable disclosing I was pregnant. After I reached 16 weeks, out of joy and need for emotional support, I told my supervisor and the owner of the business I was pregnant. A week later, I was fired because ""I just wouldn't be happy there due to personality conflicts."" It took me 4 months, without unemployment benefits (which means all of our bills, rent and car payments fell way behind and my husband was pulling 12- to 14-hour shifts, 7 days a week, as well as being threatened with eviction every month) to find another place to work. By that time, my pregnant belly was already showing, and I had very limited choices since I would obviously need maternity leave within a few months. I've been one of the lucky ones who found an office full of new and experienced moms and I was hired and still work there now.

Three of my colleagues stood up for me

In 1998, I was the only female doctor in a medical clinic. When I got pregnant with my first child, the director told me I should find another job because managing a primary care practice after having a baby was not going to be possible. Fortunately for me the clinic nurse manager, a woman, and two of my male colleagues stood up for me. I had to make concessions and be in clinic 5 days a week in order to keep my job though. Twelve years later, I became the clinic director. By then the majority of our physicians were women and motherhood was not only accommodated but celebrated.

I am a better person today because I had kids

I became pregnant with my first daughter in 2015. I was working at a rapidly growing tech company in the Midwest, and I was quickly excelling in my career. The company was mostly male but still had some female representation. The problem was that I was the FIRST female to have a baby (while working there). As soon as I told my boss and HR I was pregnant, fear set in with everyone it seemed. How do we handle this? Where will she be able to pump that's private and NOT a bathroom (which is legally required)? I also learned that the company had a paternity leave policy but NO maternity leave. I could take unpaid FMLA but no paid leave -- I couldn't even save up vacation time to use after having the baby.

Once the management team was aware, I was told to announce this to the team. After the announcement, crickets. I was on an island now. No one knew what to do with me or how to work with me. The first question was, ""Are you leaving?"" At first, I said ""No!"" That answer quickly changed. I ended up quitting that job and staying home with my baby and working as a part-time freelancer for about 3 years. It was wonderful. I will never regret that decision. However, I am now managing a growing agency (based on continuous business growth from freelancing) and I will NEVER put one of my team members in that position. I want flexibility and freedom for moms and dads that I work with. I never want to lose talent and potential because someone chooses to have a child. I know I am a better person today than I was before I had kids. I work harder. I work smarter. And I credit a lot of that to being a mom AND a bad ass businesswoman.

(CNN) Tuesday's Democratic debate featured something we have never witnessed before on a presidential debate stage: 15 full minutes of open back-and-forth about how the government should contend with the increasing power of Silicon Valley .

At the center of the exchange was a tussle between Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has been pushing for the break-up of tech giants like Facebook and Google, and Sen. Kamala Harris, who pointedly asked whether Warren would join her in demanding that Twitter suspend President Donald Trump's account on the platform.

This debate moment set the stage for what will doubtless be an election-long spat over what form regulations against internet companies should take.

This is a highly-charged and heavily politicized question, particularly for Democratic candidates. Last month, Facebook formalized a bold new policy that shocked many observers, announcing that the company would not seek to fact-check or censor politicians -- including in the context of paid political advertising, and even during an election season.

Over the past few days, this decree has pushed US political advertising into something like the Wild West: President Donald Trump, who will likely face the Democratic candidate in next year's general election, has already taken the opportunity to spread political lies with no accountability.

A frightening new world of political communication

In the aftermath of Facebook's announcement, Trump's presidential campaign disseminated an advertisement on Facebook's platform claiming that 2020 Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden had used his power as vice president to try to influence Ukraine to help his son, Hunter Biden.

The ""facts"" behind the Trump advertisement implicating Biden — which has been viewed on Facebook no fewer than five million times — have been definitively debunked , and CNN declined to air the ad for that reason.

This new Facebook policy opens a frightening new world for political communication — and for national politics. It is now the case that leading politicians can openly spread political lies without repercussion. Indeed, the Trump campaign was already spreading other falsehoods through online advertising immediately before Facebook made its announcement — and as one might predict, most of those advertisements have not been removed from the platform.

Should our politicians fail to reform regulations for internet platforms and digital advertising, our political future will be at risk. The 2016 election revealed the tremendous harm to the American democratic process that can result from coordinated misinformation campaigns ; 2020 will be far worse if we do nothing to contain the capacity for politicians to lie on social media.

The same capabilities by which political campaigns sliced up audience segments in 2016 via Facebook's advertisements will continue to exist in 2020. The difference will be that this time, the lies can be distributed by agents of the Trump campaign, instead of shell accounts operated by the Russian government and others.

Facebook's derogation of fact-checking will thus only lend greater credibility to coordinated disinformation operations — as in the case of the recent Trump campaign ad.

Warren responded to the Trump ad with a cheeky point: In an ad she has circulated over Facebook, she claims that ""Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election."" Later in the ad, she acknowledges this is a falsehood, and contends that ""what [Mark] Zuckerberg has done is given Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform — and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.""

Warren's mockery of the ad — and of the underlying policy that allowed its dissemination — helps illuminate how Facebook's new policy will have grave implications for our political future. Facebook's decision not to take down the Trump ad amounts to knowingly enabling the insidious political manipulation of American voters.

Facebook's power and ""free expression""

The irony is that Facebook already censors advertisements -- including those placed by presidential campaigns in the United States -- for a host of reasons. One investigation found that the company had taken down paid content from four of the Democratic candidates, including 117 ads that had been placed by the Biden campaign, for reasons ranging from the use of profanity to the display of fake buttons.

It is disconcerting to think that by fiat, Facebook can deem a political ad to be dishonest because it contains fake buttons (which can deceive the viewer into clicking on a survey button when in fact there is no interactive feature in the ad), but the company will refuse to take action against ads containing widely-debunked political lies, even during an American presidential election.

This perilous inconsistency in Facebook's policy decisions is a sign that its corporate power has grown too great. Concern for the public interest and the health of our democracy should compel us to action. And the only entity that has the power to do anything to improve the situation for the American people is Congress.

Facebook has one principal counterargument against regulation: that the company must maintain strong commitments to free speech and freedom of political expression. This came across in Mark Zuckerberg's speech at Georgetown University on Thursday, in which he described social media as a kind of ""Fifth Estate"" and characterized politicians' calls to take action as an attempt to restrict freedom of expression. Quoting at times from Frederick Douglass and Supreme Court jurisprudence, Zuckerberg said ""we are at a crossroads"" and asserted: ""When it's not absolutely clear what to do, we should err on the side of free expression.""

Unfortunately for Facebook, this argument holds little water. If you determine that an ad containing a fake button is non-compliant because it ""[entices] users to select an answer,"" then you certainly should not knowingly broadcast ads that entice voters to unwittingly consume publicly-known lies -- whether they are distributed by the President or any other politician. Indeed, as one official in Biden's presidential campaign has noted , Zuckerberg's argumentation amounts to an insidious ""choice to cloak Facebook's policy in a feigned concern for free expression"" to ""use the Constitution as a shield for his company's bottom line.""

Behind what the company claims to be a commitment to free speech lies a commercial convenience.

Regulatory policy is the way forward

If Facebook cannot take appropriate action and remove paid political lies from its platform, the only answer must be earnest regulation of the company -- regulation that forces Facebook to be transparent about the nature of political ads and prevents it from propagating political falsehoods, even if they are enthusiastically distributed by President Trump.

Our nation has always aspired to place the interests of our democratic purpose over the interests of markets. Silicon Valley should be no exception."

Joe Biden (D) has been under fire in recent days after it was reported that his campaign dropped short of $1 million – $924,000 – on private jet usage in the third quarter (July 1 – September 30) alone. The expenses were attributed to the EJCR, LLC Dba Advanced Aviation Team, recent Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings show.

While Biden leads the pack, he is not alone in his exorbitant private air travel expenditures. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) reportedly spent just short of $500,000 – $479,000 – on private air travel. That is a $179,000 increase from his private air travel expenses in the previous quarter, according to the Hill.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) also put her climate change-related concerns aside, spending $253,000– $236,000 more than the $17,000 she spent in the previous three months.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) – who once described climate change as the “greatest threat to our national security” – spent $360,000 on private air travel in the third quarter. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) – who described climate change as an “existential crisis that threatens all of us” – also utilized private air travel, spending $132,000 in the third quarter. However, a campaign aide told the Hill that Warren makes an effort to offset her carbon output and gave $10,150 to Native Energy in the third quarter.

An outline of the Democrat-backed Green New Deal, released this year, lamented the existence of cows and air travel but admitted that neither could be totally eliminated.

The outline stated:

We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero.

The excessive air travel of the candidates calls their authenticity into question.

Warren has called climate change an “existential crisis that threatens all of us” and called for “bold action now to stop it before it’s too late”:

Climate change is an existential crisis that threatens all of us—and we need to take bold action now to stop it before it's too late. That's why we need to have a #ClimateDebate. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) August 24, 2019

Biden – who spent nearly $1 million on private jet usage in a three-month span – warned that it is going to take “leadership” to combat the “climate crisis”:

It’s critical to have a plan to combat climate change, but it’s going to take more than plans — it’s going to take leadership. I have the experience and relationships necessary to rally the world to meet the urgency of this climate crisis. #ClimateTownHall pic.twitter.com/aXvhwUDHMq — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 5, 2019

Harris has called climate change an “imminent threat to our planet,” while Buttigieg warned that the threat “isn’t theoretical”:

Climate change is an imminent threat to our planet unless we correct course. It’s within our power to do so. Now is the time. pic.twitter.com/q1mToVv6GE — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) February 18, 2019

Climate change isn't theoretical. Parts of California are on fire, in Florida they're talking about sea level rise. In South Bend I had to activate the emergency operation center twice in two years: the first time was a 1000-year flood, the next was a 500-year flood. #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/xx7SFoImuv — Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) June 28, 2019

Sanders, who unveiled a $16 trillion climate change proposal in August, called President Trump an “idiot” for not taking climate change seriously:

Donald Trump believes climate change is a hoax. Donald Trump is an idiot. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) August 10, 2019

Nevertheless, critics argue that Democrats are demonstrating that they are not taking the matter seriously, as their actions do not always coincide with their rhetoric.

For instance, Democrats came under fire last month after attending the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry, which featured thousands of steaks. While climate change alarmists argue that red meat consumption is contributing to the “crisis,” several Democrat candidates happily assisted in grilling the juicy cuts of meat, despite some of the presidential hopefuls previously floating limiting beef consumption in order to curb the looming threat:

That's what BJ, who was living in Connecticut in 1971 and working as a bank teller, remembers about her first pregnancy. After she started to show, she had to work at a back desk away from the customers, she writes. Now living in North Carolina, BJ is one of the hundreds of women and men who wrote to us after CNN Opinion invited readers to share their experiences with pregnancy discrimination. When thinking about her own life and those of her three daughters and their pregnancies, she said, ""We have come a long way.""

When it emerged that Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren may have faced job discrimination over a pregnancy, the backlash against the claim was swift. One reason Warren's story of pregnancy discrimination prompted such an outcry from Americans on social media earlier this month and from so many of you in response to our call for stories is that for many American women -- and men -- the Pregnancy Discrimination Act feels too much like a historical footnote and little else. The Act amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to ""prohibit sex discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbrth, or related medical conditions."" Before it was signed into law in 1978, it was perfectly legal to refuse to hire, or to fire, a woman because of pregnancy.

Women who, like BJ, were working parents in the 1960s and 1970s, described what it was like seeking work as a woman of childbearing years before 1978; they recalled having to show prospective employers their birth control pills or disclose the dates of their last period to prove they weren't pregnant or wouldn't try to get pregnant if hired. Other women shared heartbreaking stories with us, ones not consigned to the pre-1978 past. Companies denying benefits after a stillbirth, demanding employees return to work one week after delivery.

For those women, it might come as no surprise to consider that as recently as this year, federal courts have been called upon to adjudicate pregnancy discrimination cases; in 2015, UPS lost a pregnancy discrimination case before the Supreme Court (in a decision that united Ruth Bader Ginsburg with Samuel Alito, two justices with very different judicial worldviews).

As recently as 2007, Melanie K. -- who worked for a staffing company and was a 39-year-old mother herself -- reported a client telling her, ""Don't bring me any women who are going to have kids."" When she asked in disbelief for clarification, her client -- a national company seeking IT professionals-- reiterated: ""Avoid any woman of child-bearing age.""

Several years after Melanie's experience, Becca K., of Cleveland, recalled her boss's words to her when she returned from maternity leave after her second child. She needed to ""dial it back to basics while getting back into the swing of things"" because ""changing diapers for three months isn't the same thing as managing a multimillion-dollar business."" For Laura Astorino of Massachusetts, the comments came from a founding partner at the firm where she worked (and where she was told she couldn't have a raise since she was going on maternity leave): he called employees with children ""breeders.""

For women today, pregnancy discrimination is ""is real, it is harrowing, and it is wrong,"" wrote our op-ed contributor Kara Alaimo

These stories of pregnancy discrimination weren't just about pregnancy -- they were also about miscarriage. They were also about adoption. They were also about supporting a pregnant partner.

I was told by my CEO that I couldn't use any of my sick leave because I wasn't theoretically 'sick'. (I was pregnant with twins and would likely have a Cesarean.) I asked the CEO if a man who has back surgery is considered 'sick'. He backed down. — Linda Avey (@lindaavey) October 9, 2019

Jeff from Provo, Utah -- now a stay-at-home dad and a writer -- was a college student when his wife lost the baby she was carrying. He described being told by one of his professors that he could only take time away from class if he provided his wife's medical documentation.

Angela from Oklahoma, wrote: ""I adopted my daughter at birth and I was basically told I wasn't going to get FMLA [12 unpaid weeks for employees who qualify under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993] for a decision I was making. However, the company policy would have allowed me to take time off if I had a drug problem, etc. Just not to take care of my child, because I CHOSE to have her, because I didn't give birth to her. I also CHOSE to leave that company.""

CNN Opinion reached out to you because Elizabeth Warren put pregnancy discrimination in the public eye and we wanted to know how you felt about it. Your willingness to share your most intimate, painful experiences humbled and honored us. Your responses showed us that for so many Americans -- past and present -- who are working to bring families into the world and support them, there are no easy answers.

""She's taken full advantage""

In 1996, I was a 4th year attorney starting a new job with a well-respected boutique firm in Houston. On my first day, one of the named partners took me to lunch. As we were entering the elevator, a visibily pregnant woman was exiting and the partner introduced her to me as one of their associates. Once on the elevator, he snidely said to me, ""This is Catherine's third child. She's taken full advantage of our maternity leave program."" I've never forgotten that comment or his tone and it definitely was in mind when I had my first, and only, child a few years later while still at the firm. I felt pressured to do a fair amount of work remotely during my 3 months of leave, so as to not damage my chance at partnership, which I eventually got. Catherine never made partner and eventually left, as I did in 2007.

I'm due in January. Things need to change

In 2011, I discovered I was pregnant after starting a new job. I work in a male-dominated field, and my pregnancy seemed to confuse my male bosses. My employer's response was, ""I've been in this industry for 10 years and I've never heard of such a thing!"" I assure you, my reproductive system works the same way as any other woman's. They didn't want to work with me on appointments. They didn't understand why I needed to miss hours for glucose tolerance testing, an amniocentesis, my anatomy scan. They were upset I could no longer lift 50 pounds or more.

I live in a state that isn't really pro-women's rights. I'd been on the job for 6 months when I was placed on modified bed rest for the last 4 weeks of my pregnancy. My company kept my job open. However, when I finally delivered, I was expected to return to work just two weeks later. I had a difficult delivery, and my doctor wouldn't authorize a return to work until 8 weeks postpartum. I didn't qualify for FMLA.

I lost that position. I was a single parent. The loss of income was devastating. I had to put my children on Medicaid to insure them. We went on SNAP for a while. In the end, I spent 18 months as a stay-at-home parent, and I cherish that time. But I'd rather have been employed.

Now, in 2019, seven years later, I find myself in the exact same position. I started a new job and discovered I was pregnant. Nothing has changed. If anything, the current environment is even more hostile to mothers in the workplace. I work for a really good company, so that helps, but I still find myself with no job protection. I still don't qualify for FMLA. My state still has no provision for pregnant women. Health care costs have skyrocketed, and as have the costs of having a baby.

I'm due in January. Things need to change. This country is lacking in women's rights. Many mothers would love to stay home with their new baby for a year [as other countries mandate in terms of paid leave]. We simply can't afford to. At the very least, we need a maternity program that isn't dependent on how long you've been working. Let us collect Social Security during that time. If our employers can't afford to hold our jobs, which is especially hard for smaller companies, let us collect unemployment. Humanity literally depends on women having babies. It's time for this country to realize that.

Men are also punished

When my wife was pregnant with our third child, we had some significant health scares for the baby requiring weekly ultrasounds. I didn't miss more work than I had sick time, but I used my accrued sick leave to help take care of my wife and children when needed. When the opportunity for promotion came up, my supervisor told me that they needed someone more dependable and that because I had taken so much time off to care for my family, I wouldn't be eligible. (I also never took time off for this without finding someone to cover as well.) I am sure that it is worse for the women who are pregnant, but men who actually take time off for pregnancy/paternity leave are also punished.

Discrimination isn't the problem. Entitlement is

Having a child as a working parent is difficult. I know because I have two children. Both were delivered via Caesarian and I was fortunate to have eight weeks with each baby after delivery. Before deciding to have children, consideration was given to the time and effort required to raise a child. It became glaringly apparent that parenting would not come without sacrifice. Never did my employer indicate that pregnancy, nursing or parenting would impact my job. Had they suggested that, I would not have blamed them. I spent 9 months mostly in the office bathroom vomiting (pre-delivery) and a significant amount of time pumping when I returned from maternity leave. Guess what, my male cohorts didn't.

I am not denying that there are ignorant people out there, but I think the prevalent problem facing us is that of entitlement. We want to be successful career women, but don't want to sacrifice having children. We want to have children, but expect to be given advantages, excuses, for sub-par performance. The reality is that life is about choices. I have made mine after careful consideration. Lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine. This is my experience. Please consider it as valid before dismissing it because it doesn't align with your storyline.

Pregnant? You still have to lift a Labrador retriever

I worked as a veterinary technician and was told that while they understood I could no longer assist with X-rays, I was expected to continue lifting dogs up to 75 lbs by myself and that I would not be allowed extra breaks or time off during my pregnancy. I considered quitting, but felt certain that another veterinary establishment would choose not to hire me if they knew I was pregnant.

What it was like the year the Pregnancy Discrimination Act became law

In 1978, I was a 21-year-old female interviewing for my first management position after college. I remember, distinctly, making it to the final round of interviews with four different corporations in which the hiring manager doing the final interview was always a white male. In three of the four interviews, I was asked when I was planning to get married and have children. My response was I wasn't in a relationship and couldn't see that happening for many years to come. After convincing them my career was my priority, each of these men followed up with a sentiment similar to, ""Of course you understand why we have to ask that question. Training new management recruits and investing in their careers is expensive. If you were to go off and start having babies, you wouldn't be able to give us the same level of commitment."" I was offered a position with all four corporations; I accepted a position with the corporation that never approached that question.

You're forced to choose and live with the consequences

I was a married PhD student. When my dissertation director found out I was expecting my first child, he was furious. ""You can't have a baby AND write a dissertation. It can't be done,"" he said. I did both, but had even more resistance about being a new mom when I defended my dissertation -- this time by the women on my committee. Even though they teach, higher ed is NOT mom-friendly. And this was in 2006!

I had another discriminatory incident when I gave birth to my second child. I was adjunct teaching at the university level and had my course load cut in half when my second child was born. I was told the cut would only last a semester, to accommodate my schedule, but the program director never reassigned the courses next semester. So my salary was permanently cut in half. I knew something like that would happen, and came back to work 3 weeks after giving birth to try to protect my job. Obviously, that didn't work.

This is the reality for women in America's higher education system. You're forced to choose, and live with the consequences. I just don't understand why Warren's comment is even a question. It happens every day.

With a baby in the NICU, I lost my job

I went into the hospital with pregnancy complications at 29 weeks and was [put on] 24-hour bed rest. I delivered my daughter 6 weeks early at 34 weeks. I notified my employer of her birth per being told to a few days later. I was then informed that I only had 2 weeks of leave left and would need to return to work after or be terminated. They ran my short-term disability and FMLA concurrently without telling me so I used up 6 out of the 8 weeks while on bed rest. I asked if I could work from home because I physically couldn't come back in two weeks (C-section delivery). It was up to my supervisor to approve and he denied stating he didn't believe I would truly work. With a new baby in the NICU and fresh from surgery, I was terminated from my job.

I never forgot the fear I had from my first pregnancy

I am Elizabeth Warren's vintage. Interviewing for my first professional job In 1978, I was pregnant but did not disclose it. Part of the hiring process was passing a physical. I actually prayed it would not disclose the pregnancy, knowing I would not get hired. After many months of working to make myself indispensable (and still hiding my pregnancy), I told my manager I would need a maternity leave. Annoyed, he said if he'd known I was pregnant he would not have hired me. Nevertheless, he did not fire me and I returned to work after a six-week leave. Four years later, I again became pregnant. My manager was then a VP and I was then a director. By that time, it was assumed I would take a leave and return to work, which I did. But I never forgot the fear I had from my first pregnancy.

""You better not be pregnant""

I was working at a law firm in 2014 and was called into my boss' office and he inappropriately told me that another attorney had just told him she was pregnant, so his direct quote to me was, ""She is pregnant so you better not be."" He then went on to tell me that only one of us could be pregnant on the team at once and that we all better coordinate that. The truth was I had just found out the day before that I was pregnant and was then completely terrified. I unfortunately suffered a miscarriage with that pregnancy, but knew that I would never be able to have a healthy pregnancy at that office. I had seen them fire a pregnant woman and also fire a woman who came back to work post pregnancy who was then hospitalized for severe postpartum depression. She was fired while still out on leave for her postpartum. I had also been told that my career would be ruined if I got pregnant. Rather than continue my career as a law firm attorney and continue in that environment, I chose to take a corporate job where I remain today, happily the mom of 2.

I've been one of the ""lucky"" ones

I went for an interview at 10 weeks pregnant. I had 2 previous consistent miscarriages, so I didn't feel comfortable disclosing I was pregnant. After I reached 16 weeks, out of joy and need for emotional support, I told my supervisor and the owner of the business I was pregnant. A week later, I was fired because ""I just wouldn't be happy there due to personality conflicts."" It took me 4 months, without unemployment benefits (which means all of our bills, rent and car payments fell way behind and my husband was pulling 12- to 14-hour shifts, 7 days a week, as well as being threatened with eviction every month) to find another place to work. By that time, my pregnant belly was already showing, and I had very limited choices since I would obviously need maternity leave within a few months. I've been one of the lucky ones who found an office full of new and experienced moms and I was hired and still work there now.

Three of my colleagues stood up for me

In 1998, I was the only female doctor in a medical clinic. When I got pregnant with my first child, the director told me I should find another job because managing a primary care practice after having a baby was not going to be possible. Fortunately for me the clinic nurse manager, a woman, and two of my male colleagues stood up for me. I had to make concessions and be in clinic 5 days a week in order to keep my job though. Twelve years later, I became the clinic director. By then the majority of our physicians were women and motherhood was not only accommodated but celebrated.

I am a better person today because I had kids

I became pregnant with my first daughter in 2015. I was working at a rapidly growing tech company in the Midwest, and I was quickly excelling in my career. The company was mostly male but still had some female representation. The problem was that I was the FIRST female to have a baby (while working there). As soon as I told my boss and HR I was pregnant, fear set in with everyone it seemed. How do we handle this? Where will she be able to pump that's private and NOT a bathroom (which is legally required)? I also learned that the company had a paternity leave policy but NO maternity leave. I could take unpaid FMLA but no paid leave -- I couldn't even save up vacation time to use after having the baby.

Once the management team was aware, I was told to announce this to the team. After the announcement, crickets. I was on an island now. No one knew what to do with me or how to work with me. The first question was, ""Are you leaving?"" At first, I said ""No!"" That answer quickly changed. I ended up quitting that job and staying home with my baby and working as a part-time freelancer for about 3 years. It was wonderful. I will never regret that decision. However, I am now managing a growing agency (based on continuous business growth from freelancing) and I will NEVER put one of my team members in that position. I want flexibility and freedom for moms and dads that I work with. I never want to lose talent and potential because someone chooses to have a child. I know I am a better person today than I was before I had kids. I work harder. I work smarter. And I credit a lot of that to being a mom AND a bad ass businesswoman.

The law that established the CFPB says the President may not remove the director except for ""inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.""

But critics -- including the Trump administration, current director Kathleen Kraninger , as well as a law firm fighting a CFPB-led investigation -- argue in court briefs that a restriction on the President's authority to remove the director at will, including over policy disagreements, ""violates the Constitution's separation of powers.""

In a move that could prove critical, the court also said it will entertain the question of whether the provision of the Dodd-Frank Act that created the bureau should also be struck.

That move ""radically ratchets up the stakes of what was already a high-stakes separation-of-powers dispute,"" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.

In Thursday's letter, Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz blasted Facebook for what he called a ""deeply flawed"" policy, saying it gives ""blanket permission"" for candidates to use the platform to ""mislead American voters all while Facebook profits from their advertising dollars."" The ad was paid for by a political action committee called The Committee to Defend the President.

Schultz wrote that the campaign will continue to mount challenges, saying, ""In the coming days and weeks, Facebook will be hearing from us about these concerns, which are shared by countless other candidates, citizens, and organizations that prioritize the health of American democracy.""

In an email obtained by CNN from Facebook's head of global elections policy, Katie Harbath, Facebook replied that the ad in question is not currently active on the platform.

Bernie Sanders returned to the campaign trail in New York on Saturday for a rally with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who delivered to him one of the most sought-after endorsements in progressive politics and called for a ""mass mobilization"" of young, working class voters in 2020.

""It wasn't until I heard of a man by the name of Bernie Sanders that I began to question and assert and recognize my inherent value as a human being who deserves health care, housing, education and a living wage,"" Ocasio-Cortez said, as she traced her trailblazing path from ""sexually harassed waitress"" across the river, in downtown Manhattan, to the halls of the United States Congress.

The ""Bernie's Back"" rally in Queensbridge Park, just outside the border of the congressional district Ocasio-Cortez was elected to represent last November, comes days after word that she and ""Squad"" ally Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota would endorse Sanders. Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan is expected to join them soon, potentially at an event later this month in her home district.

Speaking in the shadow of the Ravenswood Generating Station smokestacks, Ocasio-Cortez pointed to the site of the event as ""ground zero"" in the fight for ""environmental justice"" and, with the Queensbridge Houses, the largest development of its kind in the United States, to her left, public housing in America. The proximity of the plant to the apartment buildings, Sanders said later, was an example of the ""environmental racism"" his Green New Deal is designed to combat.

In her first public remarks since news of her endorsement spread, Ocasio-Cortez also praised the current field of Democratic presidential candidates as among the most progressive the party has ever seen -- and credited Sanders for paving the way. He returned the favor minutes later, as the pair clasped hands and raised their arms in triumph.

""I've been around politics a few years and it is hard to believe the degree to which in less than one year, this woman, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, it is hard to believe the degree to which she has transformed politics in America,"" Sanders said, praising Ocasio-Cortez as ""a fierce defender of the working class of our country"" and describing her as ""an inspiration to millions of young people, not just here in New York, but across this country, who now understand the importance of political participation and standing up for justice.""

Ocasio-Cortez told Sanders she would back him in a phone call while he was still in a Nevada hospital after a heart attack less than three weeks ago, aides to both confirmed, and news of her decision has been greeted as a welcome -- and validating -- shot of adrenaline inside a campaign that has stalled in most polling and was rattled, many on a very personal level, by Sanders' heart attack.

'I am more than ready'

Sanders and the surrogates who joined him made a point of hitting back against suggestions that he might be too old, or insufficiently fit, to win the White House next year. The 78-year-old Vermont independent was, per usual, particularly direct.

""I am happy to report to you that I am more than ready, more ready than ever to carry on with you the epic struggle that we have today,"" Sanders, who came onstage to AC/DC's ""Back in Black,"" said. ""I am more than ready to assume the office of President of the United States. I am more than ready to take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elites and their apologists ... To put it bluntly, I am back.""

A diverse crowd of Sanders supporters began to fill a stretch of the park in Northwest Queens, a hub of the progressive activism that helped scuttle Amazon's plans to build a new headquarters, here in Long Island City, hours before Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez took the stage.

Sanders' wife, Jane, declared her husband ""healthy"" and ""more than ready to continue his life-long struggle to fight for the working people of America. She was followed at the mic by filmmaker Michael Moore, who endorsed Sanders while scorning media coverage of the campaign.

""The only heart attack we should be talking about,"" Moore blared, ""is the one that Wall Street is going to have when Bernie Sanders is president.""

Sanders made his in-person return to the primary stage at Tuesday's CNN/The New York Times debate in Ohio . While Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, his fellow Senate progressive and leader in a number of recent polls, seemed to be at the center of every skirmish and the focal point of increasingly blunt attacks from the contest's centrist candidates, Sanders delivered one of his sharpest debate performances -- a showing that, at least for now, has seemed to quiet concerns over his health.

Saturday's rally, though, was something entirely different -- as Ocasio-Cortez, who had Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez have campaigned together before, during the summer of 2018, for progressive Democratic primary candidates.Saturday's rally, though, was something entirely different -- as Ocasio-Cortez, who had publicly weighed endorsing either Sanders or Warren, committed herself to his second crusade for the Democratic nomination.

Her endorsement underscored an argument the campaign has been making for months, which contends that Sanders is uniquely positioned to forge, as his campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, described it earlier this week, ""the multiracial working class coalition we need to win.""

Ari Rabin-Havt, Sanders' chief of staff, told CNN after the debate -- just a few hours after The Washington Post first reported on the endorsement -- that Ocasio-Cortez's decision would give new fuel to the ""movement"" that Sanders hopes will sweep him into the White House.

""This isn't about Bernie Sanders. This is about us,"" Rabin-Havt said. ""And this is what these endorsements are about. These are people who want a movement for change in this country. A movement for 'Medicare for All,' a movement for a Green New Deal, a movement on these issues. And you know, when Bernie Sanders says, 'Not me, us,' I think that message resonates with members of Congress who believe strongly in a movement.""

The endorsement, Justice Democrats Executive Director Alexandra Rojas said on the eve of the New York rally, is ""significant in the sense that it shows that the Bernie campaign is important to progressives and Democratic voters.""

""I know that Justice Democrats and myself (in this role) wouldn't even exist if it hadn't been for Bernie's 2016 presidential run,"" Rojas said. ""He has a young, racially diverse, totally working-class base of support, which is the same people that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez represents. She looks so much more like the grassroots base of the Democratic Party than Chuck Schumer, than Nancy Pelosi. And I think that's why the endorsement was so important for Bernie.""

Ocasio-Cortez had indicated in previous months that she could hold off in choosing a presidential candidate to support until later in the year, or even into the primaries, which begin in February with the Iowa caucuses. But rumors that she might get involved sooner heated up after a late September visit to Burlington, Vermont, where she, Sanders and a couple of close aides met for dinner, according to a source familiar with discussions, and then again the next day for brunch.

Shakir said Tuesday night that those conversations, while they did not lead to any kind of firm commitment, were ""a very key step in the process.""

""And then we, obviously, our teams worked together on a lot of details,"" Shakir said, referencing a rollout that had begun earlier that day when the campaign began teasing the appearance of a ""special guest"" at the New York rally.

Less than a week later, with Ocasio-Cortez watching on, Sanders looked ahead: ""I look forward,"" he said, ""to traveling with her all over this country.""

The comment appears to be directed at… [+3342 chars]","Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said Friday the Russians are currently ""grooming"" a Democrat running in the presidential primary to run as a third-party candidate and champion their interests.",2019-10-18,CNN,Hillary Clinton appears to suggest Russians are 'grooming' Tulsi Gabbard for third-party run,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/18/politics/hillary-clinton-tulsi-gabbard/index.html,"(CNN) Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said Thursday the Russians are currently ""grooming"" a Democrat running in the presidential primary to run as a third-party candidate and champion their interests.

The comment appears to be directed at Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard , who has been accused of being cozy with Russia in the past.

""I'm not making any predictions, but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,"" Clinton said, speaking on a podcast with former Obama adviser David Plouffe. ""She's the favorite of the Russians.""

Clinton never names Gabbard, but there are only five women running for President -- Gabbard, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and author Marianne Williamson -- and none of the other woman have been accused of being boosted by Russia.

Clinton did not provide proof about how Russia is ""grooming"" Gabbard. She and her team pointed to allegations that Russian news and propaganda sites often report on Gabbard's campaign and that moments in Gabbard's campaign have been reportedly amplified by trolls and bots on Twitter with ties to Russia. Gabbard has denied those allegations.

""They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far,"" Clinton said.

Clinton's team also noted that some of Gabbard's foreign policy views align closely with Russian interests.

Gabbard responded on Twitter Friday afternoon to Clinton's comments.

""Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain,"" she tweeted.

""From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a concerted campaign to destroy my reputation,"" she added. ""We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know — it was always you, through your proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose.""

""It's now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don't cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly.""

Responding to Gabbard's attacks, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said, ""Divisive language filled with vitriol and conspiracy theories? Can't imagine a better proof point than this.""

Asked earlier if the former secretary of state was referring to Gabbard in her comment, Merrill told CNN, ""If the nesting doll fits.""

""This is not some outlandish claim. This is reality,"" Merrill said. ""If the Russian propaganda machine, both their state media and their bot and troll operations, is backing a candidate aligned with their interests, that is just a reality, it is not speculation.""

On Friday evening, after Clinton's comments drew considerable criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, Merrill backed away from the former secretary of state's allegation, tweeting, ""She doesn't say the Russians are grooming anyone. It was a question about Republicans.""

Gabbard, in a late August interview with CNN, ruled out a third-party bid.

""I will not,"" the Hawaii Democrat told CNN. ""No, I have ruled that out.""

Gabbard has tried to fight off the charge that she is being pushed by Russian interests.

""Just two days ago, the New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears,"" Gabbard said, referring to a recent story that said she is being backed by Russians on Twitter. ""This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.""

Clinton also accused Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate in both the 2012 and 2016 elections, of being a ""Russian asset.""

""That's assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not, because she's also a Russian asset,"" Clinton said. ""Yes, she's a Russian asset, I mean, totally. They know they can't win without a third-party candidate.""

Stein's campaign, which earned nearly 1.5 million votes in the 2016 election, was part of Russia's meddling efforts, according to a host of congressional reports, including a Senate Intelligence Committee report that indicated Russian social media efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election included messaging in support of Stein.

summation of the report's findings on ""comprehensive anti-Hillary Clinton operations"" said while the group's assumed Twitter personas had some pro-Clinton content, ""the developed Left-wing Twitter personas were still largely anti-Clinton and expressed pro-Bernie Sanders and pro-Jill Stein sentiments.""

Stein, who had dinner with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2015, has also compared Russian interference in the 2016 election to American overseas efforts.

""I think it would be naive to think that Russia did not try to interfere."" But, she said, ""Certainly that's what the United States does,"" though she added, ""that's not to justify it.""

""Interference is wrong and it's an assault against democracy, and it should be pursued, but (the United States) should pursue it knowing that we do it, too.""

Mr. Trump accelerated the movement of working-class voters into the Republican Party, creating a GOP that now represents more middle- and lower-income Americans … He has reframed much of the Republican agenda to appeal to these voters, particularly on trade, immigration and foreign affairs, in many cases upending 40 years of GOP policy.

In turn, the Democrats are increasingly the party of America’s wealthiest cities, post-industrial business leaders, and the “woke” professional class.

This political transformation, however, means that U.S. college graduates have few friends in Washington, D.C., to protect their economic interests in a shifting economy.

The WSJ provides the data:

The Republican Party now represents more middle- and lower-income Americans than it did a decade ago. When all the U.S. House districts are ranked by median income, the GOP now represents 58% of the lower-income half of that spectrum, up from 39% of lower-income districts a decade ago. And it represents 34% of the higher-income half, down from 43% a decade ago.

But the shift also exacerbates the average voter’s tension with the GOP’s wealthier leadership class. The WSJ reported:

The most ardent Trump supporters agree with Mr. Trump’s restrictive positions on immigration and his opposition to efforts to address climate change, among other policies. The party-supporting Republicans believe immigration helps the nation and that near-term action to fight climate change is needed.

The share of white GOP members with college degrees has dropped from 40 percent in 2012 down to 29 percent in 2018., while the share of non-college grads has climbed from 50 percent in 2010 to 59 percent in 2018.

The WSJ did not discuss the impact of this shift on many college graduate voters who are drifting away from the GOP because of their sympathy for left-wing civic issues, such as global warming, sexual deregulation, and pro-diversity policies.

But these college graduate voters have yet to find economic allies in the pro-migration Democratic Party.

For example, Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for more immigration of “students,” which is likely a reference to young college graduates who will compete against American graduates:

We need a pathway to citizenship for the people who are here and here to stay … We need a path — not just for DREAMers — but also a path for grandmas, and for little kids, and for people who came here to work on farms, and for students who overstayed their visas. We need a path that is fair and achievable. Bring people out of the shadows. It is good for all workers, and we need to get them into our unions.

Similarly, Sen. Dick Durbin is touting legislation that would allow U.S. and Indian companies to bring in roughly 100,000 Indian white-collar workers each year.

GOP Sen. Kennedy blocks Dem Sen. Durbin's bill to skyrocket transfer of US college-jobs to Indian grads. Durbin's plan is much worse than Sen. Mike Lee's @S386 for US college grads & families. Part-Kabuki, but estb. journos act like frogs in a boiling pot. https://t.co/ZktjKG04MR — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 17, 2019

Meanwhile, investors are pressuring U.S. managers to replace many American graduates with cheaper foreign workers. On October 17, the San Jose Mercury News reported:

The San Francisco ride-hailing giant revealed in a California employment-department filing this month that it is laying off nearly 400 workers at its offices in the city and in Palo Alto. The filing showed software engineers at the firm were the hardest hit, with more than 125 people cut loose. Meanwhile, Uber this year received federal government approval for 299 new H-1B visas — work permits intended for jobs requiring specialized skills — compared with 152 in 2018 and 158 in 2017, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. It is unclear whether Uber plans to use all those visas or when new H-1B workers might be brought on. The visas typically cost thousands of dollars each to obtain. … “When they’re laying off, they shouldn’t be using H-1Bs at all, or maybe sparingly at best,” said Ron Hira, a Howard University professor who studies the use of the visa by companies. “It runs totally contrary to the intent of the H-1B program.”

Some of the labor markets for American college graduates are flooded with immigrants, admitted David Bier, an advocate at the Cato Institute, which favors easy immigration by foreign graduates:

The software engineer market, it’s so saturated with H-1Bs that some of the people who are laid off are almost inevitably H-1Bs and some of the people that are being hired are inevitably H-1Bs.

These investors get much support from some GOP legislators:

Watch GOP Sen. Mike Lee publicly urge Indian contract-workers to lobby US Senators for a bill offering fast-track citizenship to Indian grads if they take jobs (at low wages) from US grads. No GOP Sen. has rebuked him & no anti-GOP journos 'pounce.' Weird. https://t.co/A5VOsuyOVt — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 18, 2019

For the moment, Donald Trump’s administration is zig-zagging between the demands of its business allies and appeals from the swing-voting college graduate class.

(2/2) Moving and powerful. Lots of powerful competing interests, but we need to remember that the American immigration system is first and foremost supposed to be for the protection and benefit of America and Americans. — USCIS Acting Director Ken Cuccinelli (@USCISCuccinelli) October 18, 2019

“The president has made no secret of the fact that he believes immigration, first and foremost, is set up to work for America — that means economically and for the people here,” Cuccinelli told reporters at a press breakfast organized by the Christian Science Monitor.

Finding the right balance between helping American workers and American investors is a constant political dilemma, Cuccinelli said:

Is there some perfect [balanced] target point in every industry? Maybe there is, but we’re never going to be able to know it. So which side do you err on? And he has repeatedly emphasized how important it is to protect U.S. workers. Now’s he been clear with me, as well, and you all have heard him say it: he wants to see economic growth and dynamism. And that means, you know, growing companies needing to fill slots. So we’re just in a constant battle to balance those things."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Joe Biden (D) in head to head matchups in the Hawkeye State, Iowa Emerson College poll results released this week show.

The poll – taken October 13-16, 2019, among 888 registered voters in Iowa – showed the president leading both Warren and Biden in hypothetical general election matchups in Iowa, besting both candidates 51 percent to 49 percent.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), however, appeared to hold an advantage in a hypothetical matchup, leading the president by two points– 51 percent to Trump’s 49 percent. The margin of error is +/-3.2 percent, indicating that the race is in flux:

Sanders’ lead against the president comes in spite of the fact that he is not leading the Democrat field in the Hawkeye State. Rather, Warren and Biden are tied with 23 percent support each, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who garnered 16 percent support. Sanders fell to fourth place with 13 percent support, followed by Andrew Yang (D), Gov. Steve Bullock (D), and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with five percent, four percent, and three percent, respectively.

The results outlined the most trouble for Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who has tried to revive her floundering campaign by focusing on Iowa.

As Breitbart News detailed:

Harris signaled a switch in campaign strategies in September, telling a colleague that she is “f*cking moving to Iowa.” “‘I’m f*cking moving to Iowa’ – Kamala Harris,” read an email following the presidential hopeful’s quip. “She cut to the chase!” the email stated. “We’re doubling our organizers on the ground in Iowa and Kamala is ramping up her time on the trail there, beginning today in Cedar Rapids.” The following month, Harris launched her “I feel your pain” tour across Iowa, which featured the presidential hopeful speaking to Iowans in more “intimate” settings, even helping some “prepare Sunday suppers.”

Despite those efforts, she was only able to garner two percent support in the state, alongside Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and Tom Steyer (D):

The poll also showed that more Iowans oppose impeachment than support it, 48 percent to 42 percent:

42% Support

10% Unsurehttps://t.co/CIjFwBESSE — Emerson Polling (@EmersonPolling) October 17, 2019

Impeachment does not appear to be a top priority among Iowans across the board, with only six percent considering it an important factor in choosing whom to support for president. Thirty-three percent said the economy, 19 percent said health care, and ten percent chose “social issues.”

“The Democrats have some work to do in Iowa convincing voters that impeachment is a top priority of Congress; 67% of Democrats in Iowa support impeaching the president, but only 10% identify it as the most important issue in deciding their vote for president,” Emerson Polling Director Spencer Kimball said."

Summers was Treasury Secretary in Bill Clinton’s administration and a top economic adviser to Barack Obama. That makes his critique of the wealth tax proposals from Warren and Sanders particularly relevant for Democrats.

Summers said the data put forth by a pair of economists, Berkeley professors Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, to support the case for a wealth tax is “substantially misleading” and “substantially inaccurate.”

He argued on Thursday that it was likely that the wealthy could avoid much of the tax by spreading their wealth around to relatives and by donating it to organizations that would pursue their goals. This could increase their political influence because some of those organizations would likely lobby for policies their donors approve of, Summers said.

“If you had a successful wealth tax that forced people to react the way they normally would by giving away their money to organizations that share their values and spent money in pursuit of their values, you would in all likelihood increase, rather than decrease, the influence of the views of the wealthy,” Summers argued.

Warren has proposed a 2 percent tax on wealth that exceeds $50 million, and 3 percent on the amount above $1 billion.

“The arguments around political power have almost no validity,” Summers said. “The truth is you can become one of the most powerful money people around the Democratic Party or the Republican Party for four or five million dollars a year. Nothing in this world is going to be able stop the wealthiest people in America from being able to come up with a vast multiple of that.”"

“Why me for Bernie?” Moore began. “Because Bernie understands that capitalism and the greedy form of capitalism – especially what we have now – is at the core of so many of the problems that we’re talking about. And he’s not afraid to come out and just say that– that that’s a problem.”

“And you think he’s in a position to win the nomination and be president?” host Ari Melber asked.

“Oh absolutely,” Moore said, citing an Emerson Poll released this week.

“I mean there was the Emerson Poll in Iowa yesterday, showed a head to head with Bernie, Biden, and Elizabeth,” the Sicko producer said. “Only one of them came out ahead of Trump, and that was Bernie Sanders. He’s absolutely — absolutely can win this.”

The poll Moore referenced showed both Joe Biden (D) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) leading the Democrat field in the Hawkeye State with 23 percent each, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with 16 percent, and Sanders dropping to fourth with 13 percent support. However, Moore is correct, as the hypothetical general election matchups show Trump besting Biden and Warren by two points – 51 percent to 49 percent – and Sanders leading Trump by the same, with 51 percent to Trump’s 49 percent. However, with a margin of error of +/-3.2, the candidates are in a virtual dead heat in Iowa.

Moore is expected to formally endorse Sanders alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) at the “Bernie’s Back” rally in New York City Saturday afternoon."

Spending on private flights by Democratic presidential candidates soared over the past three months, from roughly $680,000 in the second quarter to more than $2.2 million in the third fundraising period of the year. Topping the spending list was former Vice President Joe Biden, who dropped about $924,000 on private air travel … South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg spent nearly $479,000 on private flights over the past three months, up from roughly $300,000 in the second quarter. And Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) used about $253,000 in campaign cash to charter flights, significantly more than the $17,000 she spent in the second quarter. The Democratic primary field’s leading progressives, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), also saw their private air travel spending swell in the three-month fundraising period. … Other candidates who dropped campaign cash on private flights include Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who spent about $40,500; Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who spent about $23,000; and former tech executive Andrew Yang, who spent just under $26,000.

Biden, Buttigieg, Harris, Sanders, Warren, Klobuchar, and Yang all support the “Green New Deal,” a plan introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) in February that calls for the elimination of fossil fuels by 2030. Of those listed above, only Bullock opposes the plan, calling it “resolution aspiration” at the second debate.

A typical private jet flight on a Cessna Citation XLS jet seating seven passengers would burn just under one ton of carbon per person — about 20% of the average annual global per capita consumption, and about one third of what the total annual per capita consumption of carbon ought to be, according to calculations by the Sierra Club in 2015.

Biden, who earlier in the debate claimed to be the “only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done,” attempted to counter the argument by highlighting his own role in the creation of the CFPB.

“I agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it,” the former vice president said. “So let’s get those things straight, too.”

Despite the rhetoric, however, official scheduling records from the Obama-era White House dispute Biden’s claims of having rallied support for the legislation. In fact, as the Intercept has reported, on the day of the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act—which created the CFPB—the former vice president’s schedule notes he was not on the floor of the U.S. Senate.

Records show that on the day the bill passed by a vote of 60-39, Biden only had one meeting with a member of Congress’s upper chamber, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC). It is unlikely, though, that Biden was attempting to sway Graham’s vote on the bill because, at the time, the senator was one of the bill’s leading opponents. Biden’s schedule for the rest of the day shows meetings regarding issues such as Iraq and the then-stimulus spending program, but nothing about Dodd-Frank:

Joe Biden told @ewarren: ""I went on the floor and got you votes."" Okay, well, here's his schedule from the day the CFPB passed. He wasn't in the Senate. So when did this happen? (Unless this 2 1/2 hour meeting with Lindsey Graham was a failed effort to win his vote.) pic.twitter.com/sdEund4cMZ — Ryan Grim (@ryangrim) October 17, 2019

As the Intercept noted, not only is there scant evidence to back up Biden’s claim of going to the “floor,” but several of those involved in Dodd-Frank’s passage also have no recollection of the former vice president playing a role. Former Rep. Brad Miller (D-NC), who helped author the bill, even went so far as to say he “cannot recall ever hearing” Biden’s name mentioned as Dodd-Frank moved through Congress:

I talked to Michael Barr once or twice, and had maybe a bootleg conversation or two with Eric Stein, whom I had known for almost 25 years but who was not approved to talk to Congress. I had no contact with Biden and cannot recall every hearing his name mentioned by anyone. — Brad Miller (@BMillRep) October 16, 2019

This is not the first time the former vice president has inflated his role in a particular event for political gain. As Breitbart News reported in August, Biden has repeatedly inflated his role in the civil rights movement of the 1960s."

Biden first used the phrase in late September when he snapped at a reporter who asked about President Donald Trump suggesting Ukraine look into allegations of corruption against him and his son, Hunter Biden.

“I know Trump deserves to be investigated. He’s violating every basic norm of a president,” Biden told Fox News Channel correspondent Peter Doocy.

“You should be asking him the question, why is he on the phone with a foreign leader trying to intimidate a foreign leader,” the former vice president continued. “Trump is doing this because he knows I will beat him like a drum. He’s using abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me.”

“Ask the right questions,” he then demanded of Doocy.

During Tuesday evening’s Democrat presidential debate, Biden once again made the pledge to beat President Trump “like a drum” while defending Hunter against accusations of nepotism and corruption related to his son’s work in Ukraine and China.

“My son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine,” Biden said. “The president and his thugs are lying. He doesn’t want me to be the candidate. If I’m the candidate, he knows I will beat him like a drum.”

While the t-shirt demonstrates the Biden campaign is confident it will win the Democrat party, it still has to fend off the insurgent campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who is leading the former vice president in several statewide polls.

Although the Biden has latched onto the phrase, it appears Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) used it in 2016 when (erroneously) predicting what then-Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton would do to then-candidate Trump in the general election.

“I’d hold my nose and vote for him but we’d get killed. Hillary Clinton would beat him like a drum,” he told CNN."

“We think people should be able to hear what politicians have to say,” said Zuckerberg. “I don’t think it’s right for tech companies to censor politicians in a democracy.”

However, more than one politician is still banned on Zuckerberg’s social network.

Laura Loomer, a Republican congressional candidate in Florida, was blacklisted by Facebook in May this year, with the social network branding her a “dangerous” individual. Her campaign is currently waging a defamation lawsuit against the tech company over the “dangerous” label, and recently filed an opposition to Facebook’s motion to dismiss the case.

Earlier in the year, Facebook also banned British right-wing activist Tommy Robinson, who went on to become a candidate for the UK Independence Party in the European Parliamentary elections last year (EXCLUSIVE: Facebook ‘Hate Agents’ List Includes British Candidates For European Election).

Zuckerberg did not mention either of these high-profile bans during his speech at Georgetown. Not did he mention the platform’s decision, in 2018, not to run a series of Republican and pro-Trump ads for the midterm elections of that year, including an ad from the Trump campaign addressing crime and illegal immigration.

In his speech, Zuckerberg indicated that he would not ban political ads in the future. “Banning political ads favors incumbents and whoever the media chooses to cover,” he said.

“While I certainly worry about erosion of truth, I don’t want to live in a world where people can only post content that tech companies judge to be true.”

The Facebook CEO’s comments come amid mounting pressure from Democrats, including the DNC, Elizabeth Warren, and the Biden campaign, to censor material from the Trump campaign drawing attention to corruption allegations against the former Vice President related to his dealings with the Ukrainian government.

Facebook has, so far, refused to cave in to this pressure.

Over 170 House Republicans, or 88 percent, have cosponsored House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs’ (R-AZ) H. Res. 604, according to a list obtained by Breitbart News. As of Friday night, only 24 House Republicans have yet to cosponsor the bill. H. Res. 604 would condemn Schiff for reading a fictional phone call between Zelensky and Trump into the record.

Schiff also allegedly lied about having never spoken to the Ukrainian intelligence officer “whistleblower.”

Rep. Biggs wanted to force a vote on the legislation this week but delayed the move after House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-MD) passed away. The Arizona conservative will reportedly force the vote Monday night.

The legislation to condemn Rep. Schiff has quickly gained support from House GOP across the political spectrum. House Freedom Caucus conservatives, moderates, and House Republican leadership have all cosponsored the legislation.

Since Biggs introduced the legislation in late September, the bill quickly gained 18 cosponsors. Now, the bill features support from 88 percent of the House Republican Conference.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), and House Republican Conference chairwoman Liz Cheney (R-WY) have sponsored the resolution to condemn Schiff.

Texas and Hurricane Harvey

Touting the ""billions and billions of dollars"" in relief money he authorized for Texas in the wake of Hurricane Harvey in 2017 -- and teasing Texas lawmakers over their requests for him to spend more -- Trump said, ""You made a fortune on the hurricane.""

Facts First: Texas did not make money from Hurricane Harvey.

Harvey created costs of $125 billion, the federal government estimates. The government says Texas has been allocated $26.6 billion in federal disaster funds since 2017.

The Texas Department of Insurance estimated in April that personal and commercial insurance payouts related to Harvey would total $19.6 billion.

The Dallas Morning News described Trump's claim as a joke, but we don't think his intentions were clear enough to brush off the comment as comedy. Texas' Democratic Party did not find it funny, saying on Twitter : ""Texans lost everything after Hurricane Harvey. Shame on you, Donald Trump.""

Harvey rescues

Trump exaggerated the number of people rescued by the Coast Guard in response to Hurricane Harvey, saying, as he has before, that they saved ""16,000 lives.""

Facts First: The Coast Guard : The Coast Guard says the correct number is 11,022 people rescued.

The Bidens

Trump conflated his accusations against former Vice President Joe Biden and son Hunter Biden -- railing against Hunter Biden's business dealings, then saying that Joe Biden ""takes a billion-five"" from China and ""allows China to rip us off."" He added, ""So the Bidens got rich while America got robbed.""

Facts First: There is no evidence Joe Biden has received large sums of money from China or has otherwise gained wealth as a result of his son's business dealings abroad.

Trump has previously made the ""billion-five"" accusation against Hunter Biden. While a conservative author has used this figure , it has not been proven. A lawyer for Hunter Biden, George Mesires, says the investment company in which Hunter Biden has an equity stake was capitalized with a total of about $4.2 million at today's exchange rates, ""not $1.5 billion."" Even this investment was not a direct payment to Hunter Biden; Hunter Biden holds a 10% stake in the firm, Mesires says , and has not made a profit to date.

Obama and AIDS

Vowing to end the AIDS epidemic in the US within a decade, Trump said the Obama administration spent ""no money on that.""

Facts First: The Obama administration spent $10.8 billion on domestic HIV/AIDS research between the 2013 fiscal year and 2016 fiscal year alone, according to a The Obama administration spent $10.8 billion on domestic HIV/AIDS research between the 2013 fiscal year and 2016 fiscal year alone, according to a review by the Kaiser Family Foundation, and $85.1 billion more on domestic HIV/AIDS care, housing and prevention programs in those four years. It also spent $26 billion on international HIV/AIDS initiatives of various kinds over the same time period.

Democrats and undocumented immigrants

Trump noted that all of the 10 Democratic presidential candidates at a debate in June raised their hand to say they would extend health care coverage to undocumented immigrants, then claimed that the Democrats ""want to give more to illegal aliens than they give to American citizens.""

Facts First: This is false. The Democrats want to give these immigrants the same access to care that citizens have, not more.

The Turkey deal

Hailing his Thursday deal with Turkey, in which Turkey agreed to suspend military operations in northeast Syria for five days to allow Kurdish fighters to leave the area, Trump claimed that others had been unable to make a deal for 15 years or 20 years.

Facts First: Experts Experts told CNN that it is not true that previous presidents had sought any such deal. The deal was narrowly tailored to a Turkish offensive that only began this month; previous presidents had not sought to give Turkish forces control over a part of Syria; and Syria's civil war had not even begun 15 or 20 years ago.

The whistleblower

Trump said again that the whistleblower who complained about his dealings with Ukraine ""got it all wrong.""

Facts First: The whistleblower's The whistleblower's account of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was highly accurate -- as the rough transcript released by the White House confirms.

Schiff's comments

Trump suggested that he had ""caught"" Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff by doing ""the unexpected"" and releasing the rough transcript of the call, thus proving Schiff's exaggerated account of the call was inaccurate.

Facts First: Schiff delivered his rendition of the call the day after Trump released the transcript, not before. Trump initially recounted the timeline correctly, Schiff delivered his rendition of the call the day after Trump released the transcript, not before. Trump initially recounted the timeline correctly, then adopted this incorrect timeline

The Internal Revenue Service

Trump said, ""I will never allow the IRS to be used as a political weapon -- except in the case of myself, where they use it against me.""

Facts First: There is no basis for Trump's claim that he is allowing the IRS to be used against himself. The IRS is run by a Trump appointee, Charles Rettig, and there is no evidence it is being used against Trump; Democrats are seeking access to his tax returns, but that is not the same thing.

Pre-existing conditions

Trump repeated his promise to ""always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.""

Facts First: The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump is currently supporting a Republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of Obamacare void. He has not issued a plan to reinstate the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions if the suit succeeds.

Obama and judicial vacancies

Trump claimed that President Barack Obama left him ""142"" judicial vacancies.

Facts First: There were 104 vacancies on January 1, 2017, just before Trump was inaugurated, according to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments.

The history of judicial vacancies

Mocking Obama's record on appointing judges, Trump claimed that presidents before him were ""always"" left zero judicial vacancies to fill.

Facts First: According to Wheeler, there were 53 vacancies on January 1, 2009, just before Barack Obama took office; 80 vacancies on January 1, 2001, just before George W. Bush took office; 107 vacancies on January 1, 1993, just before Bill Clinton took office. So Trump had the most judges to appoint since Clinton, but, clearly, other presidents also had appointing to do.)

Veterans Choice

Trump took credit for passing the Veterans Choice program, saying that others had tried and failed to do so for almost ""50 years.""

Facts First: Obama signed the Choice program into law in 2014. Trump signed a law in 2018, the VA MISSION Act, to expand and change the program.

The unemployment rate

Trump exaggerated as usual on the impressive unemployment rate, saying it was the lowest in ""51 years.""

Facts First: The September The September rate , 3.5%, was the lowest since December 1969, just under 50 years ago.

Energy production

Trump claimed to have ended ""the war"" on American energy, then boasted of the US ""now"" being the world's ""number one production of oil and natural gas.""

Facts First: The US has not just ""now"" become the world's top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump's policies: it took the top spot The US has not just ""now"" become the world's top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump's policies: it took the top spot in 2012 , under the very president he has accused of perpetuating the""war."" The US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump's tenure.

Wind energy

Trump told his usual semi-comedic story about how, if ""windmills"" are used for energy as he said Democrats want, people's televisions will go out if the wind is not presently blowing.

Facts First: Democrats support the use of wind turbines. Using wind power as part of a mix of power sources does not cause power outages even when the wind isn't blowing, as the federal Department of Energy Democrats support the use of wind turbines. Using wind power as part of a mix of power sources does not cause power outages even when the wind isn't blowing, as the federal Department of Energy explains on its website. ""Studies have shown that the grid can accommodate large penetrations of variable renewable power without sacrificing reliability, and without the need for 'backup' generation,"" the Department of Energy says.

The World Trade Organization

Trump claimed the US did not win ""any cases"" at the World Trade Organization before he came along -- ""anything for years, practically.""

Facts First: Trump's own Council of Economic Advisers Trump's own Council of Economic Advisers noted in a February report that the US had won 86% of the cases it had brought since 1995. Like other countries, the US tends to win when it brings the cases, lose when cases are brought against it.

China's agricultural spending

Trump claimed China had never spent more than $20 billion in a year on US agricultural products.

Facts First: China spent $25.9 billion in 2012, according to figures from the Department of Agriculture.

The trade deficit with China

Trump claimed the US trade deficit with China has long been $500 billion per year.

Facts First: Through 2018, there has never been a $500 billion trade deficit with China. The 2018 deficit was $381 billion last year when counting goods and services, $420 billion when counting goods alone.

China and tariffs

Trump said again that his tariffs on imported Chinese products have ""cost us nothing,"" claiming China has ""eaten"" the cost.

Facts First: A bevy of economic studies have found that Americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs, and Americans make the actual tariff payments.

Mexican troops

Trump claimed that there are 27,000 Mexican soldiers ""on our border"" to help with migration issues.

Facts First: Acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan told reporters in September that 10,000 of the approximately 25,000 Mexican troops deployed were on Mexico's own southern border: ""They've created a new national guard within their country: 10,000 troops to the southern border; 15,000 troops to the northern border with the United States,"" he Acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan told reporters in September that 10,000 of the approximately 25,000 Mexican troops deployed were on Mexico's own southern border: ""They've created a new national guard within their country: 10,000 troops to the southern border; 15,000 troops to the northern border with the United States,"" he said

Defense spending

Trump claimed to have spent ""more than $2.5 trillion"" on the armed forces, increasing this number from the straight ""$2.5 trillion"" he had cited last week

Facts First: Defense spending for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 was $2.05 trillion, and that includes more than three-and-a-half months of Obama's tenure, since the 2017 fiscal year began in October 2016.

Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he thinks Trump must have been including military funding for the 2020 fiscal year to get to ""$2.5 trillion"" figure -- but since the 2020 fiscal year has just started, and Harrison noted that the defense appropriation has not yet been approved by Congress.

Democrats and borders

Trump claimed Democrats support ""open borders.""

Facts First: Even the most liberal of Democratic presidential candidates do not advocate unrestricted migration.

The wall

Trump said his wall on the Mexican border is ""going up rapidly.""

Facts First: As of September 30, no additional miles of border wall had been built during Trump's presidency in places where barriers had not existed before, according to a fact sheet from Customs and Border Protection. Over Trump's tenure in office, 69 miles of barriers had been constructed in places where ""dilapidated and outdated"" barriers had existed before; that's a pace of about half a mile of replacement barrier per week.

Democrats and the wall

Trump repeated his claim that ""almost"" all of the Democrats wanted a wall on the Mexican border five years ago.

Facts First: Democrats did support Republican demands for fencing in the comprehensive immigration reform bill six years ago, but that was fencing -- and Democrats agreed to endorse it only in exchange for Republican support for their own preferred policies, like a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

The crowd

Urging the fire marshal to let more supporters into the arena, Trump claimed that there were ""close to 30,000"" outside.

Facts First: Trump's estimate was not even close. ""We didn't have 30K outside. Probably had upward of 5K outside,"" Dallas Police Department spokesman Sgt. Mitchell Warren told CNN in an email."

The responses were humbling and show there are no easy answers.",2019-10-19,CNN,Opinion: Your pregnancy discrimination stories prove there are no easy answers,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/19/opinions/elizabeth-warren-pregnancy-discrimination-reader-response-carr/index.html,"(CNN) ""Back then, you had to be married for nine months before delivering your baby or your maternity insurance wouldn't kick in.""

That's what BJ, who was living in Connecticut in 1971 and working as a bank teller, remembers about her first pregnancy. After she started to show, she had to work at a back desk away from the customers, she writes. Now living in North Carolina, BJ is one of the hundreds of women and men who wrote to us after CNN Opinion invited readers to share their experiences with pregnancy discrimination. When thinking about her own life and those of her three daughters and their pregnancies, she said, ""We have come a long way.""

When it emerged that Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren may have faced job discrimination over a pregnancy, the backlash against the claim was swift. One reason Warren's story of pregnancy discrimination prompted such an outcry from Americans on social media earlier this month and from so many of you in response to our call for stories is that for many American women -- and men -- the Pregnancy Discrimination Act feels too much like a historical footnote and little else. The Act amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to ""prohibit sex discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbrth, or related medical conditions."" Before it was signed into law in 1978, it was perfectly legal to refuse to hire, or to fire, a woman because of pregnancy.

Women who, like BJ, were working parents in the 1960s and 1970s, described what it was like seeking work as a woman of childbearing years before 1978; they recalled having to show prospective employers their birth control pills or disclose the dates of their last period to prove they weren't pregnant or wouldn't try to get pregnant if hired. Other women shared heartbreaking stories with us, ones not consigned to the pre-1978 past. Companies denying benefits after a stillbirth, demanding employees return to work one week after delivery.

For those women, it might come as no surprise to consider that as recently as this year, federal courts have been called upon to adjudicate pregnancy discrimination cases; in 2015, UPS lost a pregnancy discrimination case before the Supreme Court (in a decision that united Ruth Bader Ginsburg with Samuel Alito, two justices with very different judicial worldviews).

As recently as 2007, Melanie K. -- who worked for a staffing company and was a 39-year-old mother herself -- reported a client telling her, ""Don't bring me any women who are going to have kids."" When she asked in disbelief for clarification, her client -- a national company seeking IT professionals-- reiterated: ""Avoid any woman of child-bearing age.""

Several years after Melanie's experience, Becca K., of Cleveland, recalled her boss's words to her when she returned from maternity leave after her second child. She needed to ""dial it back to basics while getting back into the swing of things"" because ""changing diapers for three months isn't the same thing as managing a multimillion-dollar business.""

For women today, pregnancy discrimination is ""is real, it is harrowing, and it is wrong,"" wrote our op-ed contributor Kara Alaimo

These stories of pregnancy discrimination weren't just about pregnancy -- they were also about miscarriage. They were also about adoption. They were also about supporting a pregnant partner.

I was told by my CEO that I couldn't use any of my sick leave because I wasn't theoretically 'sick'. (I was pregnant with twins and would likely have a Cesarean.) I asked the CEO if a man who has back surgery is considered 'sick'. He backed down. — Linda Avey (@lindaavey) October 9, 2019

I also CHOSE to leave that company.""

""She's taken full advantage""

In 1996, I was a 4th year attorney starting a new job with a well-respected boutique firm in Houston. On my first day, one of the named partners took me to lunch. As we were entering the elevator, a visibily pregnant woman was exiting and the partner introduced her to me as one of their associates. Once on the elevator, he snidely said to me, ""This is Catherine's third child. She's taken full advantage of our maternity leave program."" I've never forgotten that comment or his tone and it definitely was in mind when I had my first, and only, child a few years later while still at the firm. I felt pressured to do a fair amount of work remotely during my 3 months of leave, so as to not damage my chance at partnership, which I eventually got. Catherine never made partner and eventually left, as I did in 2007.

I'm due in January. Things need to change

In 2011, I discovered I was pregnant after starting a new job. I work in a male-dominated field, and my pregnancy seemed to confuse my male bosses. My employer's response was, ""I've been in this industry for 10 years and I've never heard of such a thing!"" I assure you, my reproductive system works the same way as any other woman's. They didn't want to work with me on appointments. They didn't understand why I needed to miss hours for glucose tolerance testing, an amniocentesis, my anatomy scan. They were upset I could no longer lift 50 pounds or more.

I live in a state that isn't really pro-women's rights. I'd been on the job for 6 months when I was placed on modified bed rest for the last 4 weeks of my pregnancy. My company kept my job open. However, when I finally delivered, I was expected to return to work just two weeks later. I had a difficult delivery, and my doctor wouldn't authorize a return to work until 8 weeks postpartum. I didn't qualify for FMLA.

I lost that position. I was a single parent. The loss of income was devastating. I had to put my children on Medicaid to insure them. We went on SNAP for a while. In the end, I spent 18 months as a stay-at-home parent, and I cherish that time. But I'd rather have been employed.

Now, in 2019, seven years later, I find myself in the exact same position. I started a new job and discovered I was pregnant. Nothing has changed. If anything, the current environment is even more hostile to mothers in the workplace. I work for a really good company, so that helps, but I still find myself with no job protection. I still don't qualify for FMLA. My state still has no provision for pregnant women. Health care costs have skyrocketed, and as have the costs of having a baby.

I'm due in January. Things need to change. This country is lacking in women's rights. Many mothers would love to stay home with their new baby for a year [as other countries mandate in terms of paid leave]. We simply can't afford to. At the very least, we need a maternity program that isn't dependent on how long you've been working. Let us collect Social Security during that time. If our employers can't afford to hold our jobs, which is especially hard for smaller companies, let us collect unemployment. Humanity literally depends on women having babies. It's time for this country to realize that.

Men are also punished

When my wife was pregnant with our third child, we had some significant health scares for the baby requiring weekly ultrasounds. I didn't miss more work than I had sick time, but I used my accrued sick leave to help take care of my wife and children when needed. When the opportunity for promotion came up, my supervisor told me that they needed someone more dependable and that because I had taken so much time off to care for my family, I wouldn't be eligible. (I also never took time off for this without finding someone to cover as well.) I am sure that it is worse for the women who are pregnant, but men who actually take time off for pregnancy/paternity leave are also punished.

Discrimination isn't the problem. Entitlement is

Having a child as a working parent is difficult. I know because I have two children. Both were delivered via Caesarian and I was fortunate to have eight weeks with each baby after delivery. Before deciding to have children, consideration was given to the time and effort required to raise a child. It became glaringly apparent that parenting would not come without sacrifice. Never did my employer indicate that pregnancy, nursing or parenting would impact my job. Had they suggested that, I would not have blamed them. I spent 9 months mostly in the office bathroom vomiting (pre-delivery) and a significant amount of time pumping when I returned from maternity leave. Guess what, my male cohorts didn't.

I am not denying that there are ignorant people out there, but I think the prevalent problem facing us is that of entitlement. We want to be successful career women, but don't want to sacrifice having children. We want to have children, but expect to be given advantages, excuses, for sub-par performance. The reality is that life is about choices. I have made mine after careful consideration. Lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine. This is my experience. Please consider it as valid before dismissing it because it doesn't align with your storyline.

Pregnant? You still have to lift a Labrador retriever

I worked as a veterinary technician and was told that while they understood I could no longer assist with X-rays, I was expected to continue lifting dogs up to 75 lbs by myself and that I would not be allowed extra breaks or time off during my pregnancy. I considered quitting, but felt certain that another veterinary establishment would choose not to hire me if they knew I was pregnant.

What it was like the year the Pregnancy Discrimination Act became law

In 1978, I was a 21-year-old female interviewing for my first management position after college. I remember, distinctly, making it to the final round of interviews with four different corporations in which the hiring manager doing the final interview was always a white male. In three of the four interviews, I was asked when I was planning to get married and have children. My response was I wasn't in a relationship and couldn't see that happening for many years to come. After convincing them my career was my priority, each of these men followed up with a sentiment similar to, ""Of course you understand why we have to ask that question. Training new management recruits and investing in their careers is expensive. If you were to go off and start having babies, you wouldn't be able to give us the same level of commitment."" I was offered a position with all four corporations; I accepted a position with the corporation that never approached that question.

You're forced to choose and live with the consequences

I was a married PhD student. When my dissertation director found out I was expecting my first child, he was furious. ""You can't have a baby AND write a dissertation. It can't be done,"" he said. I did both, but had even more resistance about being a new mom when I defended my dissertation -- this time by the women on my committee. Even though they teach, higher ed is NOT mom-friendly. And this was in 2006!

I had another discriminatory incident when I gave birth to my second child. I was adjunct teaching at the university level and had my course load cut in half when my second child was born. I was told the cut would only last a semester, to accommodate my schedule, but the program director never reassigned the courses next semester. So my salary was permanently cut in half. I knew something like that would happen, and came back to work 3 weeks after giving birth to try to protect my job. Obviously, that didn't work.

This is the reality for women in America's higher education system. You're forced to choose, and live with the consequences. I just don't understand why Warren's comment is even a question. It happens every day.

With a baby in the NICU, I lost my job

I went into the hospital with pregnancy complications at 29 weeks and was [put on] 24-hour bed rest. I delivered my daughter 6 weeks early at 34 weeks. I notified my employer of her birth per being told to a few days later. I was then informed that I only had 2 weeks of leave left and would need to return to work after or be terminated. They ran my short-term disability and FMLA concurrently without telling me so I used up 6 out of the 8 weeks while on bed rest. I asked if I could work from home because I physically couldn't come back in two weeks (C-section delivery). It was up to my supervisor to approve and he denied stating he didn't believe I would truly work. With a new baby in the NICU and fresh from surgery, I was terminated from my job.

I never forgot the fear I had from my first pregnancy

I am Elizabeth Warren's vintage. Interviewing for my first professional job In 1978, I was pregnant but did not disclose it. Part of the hiring process was passing a physical. I actually prayed it would not disclose the pregnancy, knowing I would not get hired. After many months of working to make myself indispensable (and still hiding my pregnancy), I told my manager I would need a maternity leave. Annoyed, he said if he'd known I was pregnant he would not have hired me. Nevertheless, he did not fire me and I returned to work after a six-week leave. Four years later, I again became pregnant. My manager was then a VP and I was then a director. By that time, it was assumed I would take a leave and return to work, which I did. But I never forgot the fear I had from my first pregnancy.

""You better not be pregnant""

I was working at a law firm in 2014 and was called into my boss' office and he inappropriately told me that another attorney had just told him she was pregnant, so his direct quote to me was, ""She is pregnant so you better not be."" He then went on to tell me that only one of us could be pregnant on the team at once and that we all better coordinate that. The truth was I had just found out the day before that I was pregnant and was then completely terrified. I unfortunately suffered a miscarriage with that pregnancy, but knew that I would never be able to have a healthy pregnancy at that office. I had seen them fire a pregnant woman and also fire a woman who came back to work post pregnancy who was then hospitalized for severe postpartum depression. She was fired while still out on leave for her postpartum. I had also been told that my career would be ruined if I got pregnant. Rather than continue my career as a law firm attorney and continue in that environment, I chose to take a corporate job where I remain today, happily the mom of 2.

I've been one of the ""lucky"" ones

I went for an interview at 10 weeks pregnant. I had 2 previous consistent miscarriages, so I didn't feel comfortable disclosing I was pregnant. After I reached 16 weeks, out of joy and need for emotional support, I told my supervisor and the owner of the business I was pregnant. A week later, I was fired because ""I just wouldn't be happy there due to personality conflicts."" It took me 4 months, without unemployment benefits (which means all of our bills, rent and car payments fell way behind and my husband was pulling 12- to 14-hour shifts, 7 days a week, as well as being threatened with eviction every month) to find another place to work. By that time, my pregnant belly was already showing, and I had very limited choices since I would obviously need maternity leave within a few months. I've been one of the lucky ones who found an office full of new and experienced moms and I was hired and still work there now.

Three of my colleagues stood up for me

In 1998, I was the only female doctor in a medical clinic. When I got pregnant with my first child, the director told me I should find another job because managing a primary care practice after having a baby was not going to be possible. Fortunately for me the clinic nurse manager, a woman, and two of my male colleagues stood up for me. I had to make concessions and be in clinic 5 days a week in order to keep my job though. Twelve years later, I became the clinic director. By then the majority of our physicians were women and motherhood was not only accommodated but celebrated.

I am a better person today because I had kids

I became pregnant with my first daughter in 2015. I was working at a rapidly growing tech company in the Midwest, and I was quickly excelling in my career. The company was mostly male but still had some female representation. The problem was that I was the FIRST female to have a baby (while working there). As soon as I told my boss and HR I was pregnant, fear set in with everyone it seemed. How do we handle this? Where will she be able to pump that's private and NOT a bathroom (which is legally required)? I also learned that the company had a paternity leave policy but NO maternity leave. I could take unpaid FMLA but no paid leave -- I couldn't even save up vacation time to use after having the baby.

Once the management team was aware, I was told to announce this to the team. After the announcement, crickets. I was on an island now. No one knew what to do with me or how to work with me. The first question was, ""Are you leaving?"" At first, I said ""No!"" That answer quickly changed. I ended up quitting that job and staying home with my baby and working as a part-time freelancer for about 3 years. It was wonderful. I will never regret that decision. However, I am now managing a growing agency (based on continuous business growth from freelancing) and I will NEVER put one of my team members in that position. I want flexibility and freedom for moms and dads that I work with. I never want to lose talent and potential because someone chooses to have a child. I know I am a better person today than I was before I had kids. I work harder. I work smarter. And I credit a lot of that to being a mom AND a bad ass businesswoman.

(CNN) Tuesday's Democratic debate featured something we have never witnessed before on a presidential debate stage: 15 full minutes of open back-and-forth about how the government should contend with the increasing power of Silicon Valley .

At the center of the exchange was a tussle between Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has been pushing for the break-up of tech giants like Facebook and Google, and Sen. Kamala Harris, who pointedly asked whether Warren would join her in demanding that Twitter suspend President Donald Trump's account on the platform.

This debate moment set the stage for what will doubtless be an election-long spat over what form regulations against internet companies should take.

This is a highly-charged and heavily politicized question, particularly for Democratic candidates. Last month, Facebook formalized a bold new policy that shocked many observers, announcing that the company would not seek to fact-check or censor politicians -- including in the context of paid political advertising, and even during an election season.

Over the past few days, this decree has pushed US political advertising into something like the Wild West: President Donald Trump, who will likely face the Democratic candidate in next year's general election, has already taken the opportunity to spread political lies with no accountability.

A frightening new world of political communication

In the aftermath of Facebook's announcement, Trump's presidential campaign disseminated an advertisement on Facebook's platform claiming that 2020 Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden had used his power as vice president to try to influence Ukraine to help his son, Hunter Biden.

The ""facts"" behind the Trump advertisement implicating Biden — which has been viewed on Facebook no fewer than five million times — have been definitively debunked , and CNN declined to air the ad for that reason.

This new Facebook policy opens a frightening new world for political communication — and for national politics. It is now the case that leading politicians can openly spread political lies without repercussion. Indeed, the Trump campaign was already spreading other falsehoods through online advertising immediately before Facebook made its announcement — and as one might predict, most of those advertisements have not been removed from the platform.

Should our politicians fail to reform regulations for internet platforms and digital advertising, our political future will be at risk. The 2016 election revealed the tremendous harm to the American democratic process that can result from coordinated misinformation campaigns ; 2020 will be far worse if we do nothing to contain the capacity for politicians to lie on social media.

The same capabilities by which political campaigns sliced up audience segments in 2016 via Facebook's advertisements will continue to exist in 2020. The difference will be that this time, the lies can be distributed by agents of the Trump campaign, instead of shell accounts operated by the Russian government and others.

Facebook's derogation of fact-checking will thus only lend greater credibility to coordinated disinformation operations — as in the case of the recent Trump campaign ad.

Warren responded to the Trump ad with a cheeky point: In an ad she has circulated over Facebook, she claims that ""Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election."" Later in the ad, she acknowledges this is a falsehood, and contends that ""what [Mark] Zuckerberg has done is given Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform — and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.""

Warren's mockery of the ad — and of the underlying policy that allowed its dissemination — helps illuminate how Facebook's new policy will have grave implications for our political future. Facebook's decision not to take down the Trump ad amounts to knowingly enabling the insidious political manipulation of American voters.

Facebook's power and ""free expression""

The irony is that Facebook already censors advertisements -- including those placed by presidential campaigns in the United States -- for a host of reasons. One investigation found that the company had taken down paid content from four of the Democratic candidates, including 117 ads that had been placed by the Biden campaign, for reasons ranging from the use of profanity to the display of fake buttons.

It is disconcerting to think that by fiat, Facebook can deem a political ad to be dishonest because it contains fake buttons (which can deceive the viewer into clicking on a survey button when in fact there is no interactive feature in the ad), but the company will refuse to take action against ads containing widely-debunked political lies, even during an American presidential election.

This perilous inconsistency in Facebook's policy decisions is a sign that its corporate power has grown too great. Concern for the public interest and the health of our democracy should compel us to action. And the only entity that has the power to do anything to improve the situation for the American people is Congress.

Facebook has one principal counterargument against regulation: that the company must maintain strong commitments to free speech and freedom of political expression. This came across in Mark Zuckerberg's speech at Georgetown University on Thursday, in which he described social media as a kind of ""Fifth Estate"" and characterized politicians' calls to take action as an attempt to restrict freedom of expression. Quoting at times from Frederick Douglass and Supreme Court jurisprudence, Zuckerberg said ""we are at a crossroads"" and asserted: ""When it's not absolutely clear what to do, we should err on the side of free expression.""

Unfortunately for Facebook, this argument holds little water. If you determine that an ad containing a fake button is non-compliant because it ""[entices] users to select an answer,"" then you certainly should not knowingly broadcast ads that entice voters to unwittingly consume publicly-known lies -- whether they are distributed by the President or any other politician. Indeed, as one official in Biden's presidential campaign has noted , Zuckerberg's argumentation amounts to an insidious ""choice to cloak Facebook's policy in a feigned concern for free expression"" to ""use the Constitution as a shield for his company's bottom line.""

Behind what the company claims to be a commitment to free speech lies a commercial convenience.

Regulatory policy is the way forward

If Facebook cannot take appropriate action and remove paid political lies from its platform, the only answer must be earnest regulation of the company -- regulation that forces Facebook to be transparent about the nature of political ads and prevents it from propagating political falsehoods, even if they are enthusiastically distributed by President Trump.

“While in detention, transgender migrants and asylum seekers are particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment, discrimination, and abuse,” Warren writes in the letter. “The United States should protect individuals fleeing persecution and targeted violence, including persecution based on gender identity or expression — not subject them to further harm.”

“Trans migrants and asylum seekers are particularly vulnerable,” Warren wrote on Twitter. “We must end unnecessary detention and enforce strict standards to keep trans migrants and asylum seekers safe — and I’ll continue holding our government accountable when they fail to do so.”

The demand for transgender border crossers to be released into the U.S. interior is the latest case Warren has made for open borders while on the campaign trail.

Most recently, Warren outlined a plan to provide back pay to all illegal aliens who are determined to have been underpaid or unpaid for previous work, Breitbart News reported. Likewise, Warren has said that border crossers must not be “unnecessarily” detained and instead freed into the interior of the U.S. and has claimed that driving up foreign competition in the labor market by providing amnesty to 11 million to 22 million illegal aliens is “good” for American workers.

Though Warren has taken a populist-nationalist stance on various economic policies, her plan to support more immigration to the U.S. is a key component of the globalist agenda supported by the nation’s donor class.

Don't lose sight of this amazing fact: Astronaut and first-time Senate candidate Mark Kelly had more money in the bank ($9.5 million) than Joe Biden's presidential campaign ( $8.98 million ) at the end of September.

That's Joe Biden. The three-plus decade senator. The eight-year vice president. The front-runner in the 2020 race since the moment he got into it. (Until now, that is. More on that below.)

Biden's fundraising problems aren't actually all that surprising. He's never been much of a fundraiser -- or enjoyed doing it. And he never built the small-dollar national network that more liberal candidates likes Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren have accrued.

None of those rationalizations change the fact that Biden has considerably less money to spend in the final 100 days before people start voting that any of his top rivals -- including Sanders, Warren and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

How can Biden change that reality? He probably can't. If he wasn't able to raise money well (and easily) as the clear front-runner, he's going to have a much harder time convincing people to give him money given the changing dynamics in the contest.

4. Bernie's back?: That's the message coming out of Sanders' campaign as he seeks to change the subject from his recent heart attack and the is-he-too-old-for-this? conversation that event has spurred.

Sanders' efforts to move on got a big boost over the weekend when New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed him over Warren. ""It wasn't until I heard of a man by the name of Bernie Sanders that I began to question and assert and recognize my inherent value as a human being who deserves health care, housing, education and a living wage,"" Ocasio-Cortez said at a rally announcing her 2020 pick

What happens next? Well, Sanders has the AOC endorsement as well as $30+ million in the bank -- two very good things with about 100 days left until Iowa. The question now becomes: Does he have another issue on the campaign trail related to his health or age? If not, Sanders' heart attack might seem like a million years ago by the time Iowa Democrats turn out to vote in the caucuses. But if Sanders has any sort of problem between now and then, it's likely the end of his campaign.

3. The super-weird Hillary vs. Tulsi dynamic: Hillary Clinton started Hillary Clinton started one of the strangest news cycles in the 2020 race at the end of the last week when she seemed to suggest that the Russians were ""grooming"" Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to run as a third-party candidate. Gabbard, thrilled with the unexpected chance to battle with one of the biggest figures in the party, called Clinton the ""queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.""

What now? Well, Buttigieg gave the story a bit more fuel Sunday morning. ""I don't know what the basis is for that,"" he said of Gabbard on CNN's ""State of the Union"" with Jake Tapper. ""But I consider her to be a competitor. I respect her service.""

Does this become a story that all of the major contenders on the Democratic side have to respond to? And do any of them take it as an opportunity to distance themselves from the Clinton era that many Democrats would like to put behind them?

2. Trump slump ... dump?: I'm hesitant to predict any sort of major walk-away from President Donald Trump by congressional Republicans over the Ukraine scandal because, well, they haven't walked away from him over all of the other terrible stories surrounding him over his first three-ish years in office.

And yet, there are cracks. Over the weekend, former Ohio Gov. John Kasich announced that he supported the impeachment and removal of Trump. Florida Rep. Francis Rooney, a Republican, said he would consider impeaching Trump -- and then promptly announced his plan to retire from Congress in 2020

The question is whether any more fissures emerge following Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney's admission that there was a quid pro quo between the US and Ukraine to force an investigation into the Democratic National Committee's physical server. (Trump -- and Mulvaney, I suppose? -- believe the server might be in Ukraine. It's not.

There is somewhat clear evidence that Trump is melting down amid the pressures applied by the House impeachment inquiry. The latest evidence? His Saturday night reversal on plans announced Thursday to hold the 2020 G7 summit at his Doral club in Miami.

Is there any scenario in which Republicans say enough is enough and begin to break from Trump publicly in big numbers? If it's possible, we might be on the verge of it.

1. The new Democratic front-runner ... now what?: There's a new top dog in the Democratic field: Elizabeth Warren. There's a new top dog in the Democratic field: Elizabeth Warren. As Harry Enten and I noted in our brandnew rankings of the 10 Democrats most likely to wind up as the party's nominee, Warren has overtaken Biden not just in polling but also in money and organization. She also has the clearest path to be the nominee, with a polling and organizational edges in Iowa and a geographic connection in New Hampshire.

So now what? Well, last week's debate is an indicator of what this next phase of the Democratic race will look like -- as the Massachusetts senator was attacked for a variety of her positions by no fewer than seven of her rivals. (Warren did the best she could amid the onslaught, but no one could be expected to prosper under those circumstances.)

Warren's most obvious weakness -- from a policy perspective -- is on her ongoing unwillingness to state, clearly, whether or not middle-class families will see their taxes go up under her ""Medicare for All"" plan. The answer to that is almost certainly yes -- as Sanders, another ""Medicare for All"" proponent, acknowledged in the debate."

Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren would be a difficult one as she weighed her 2020 presidential endorsement.,2019-10-20,CNN,Why Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Bernie Sanders,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/19/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-endorses-bernie-sanders/index.html,"(CNN) Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez never hid from the fact that choosing between Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, as she weighed her 2020 presidential endorsement, would be a difficult one.

She was open, when asked, about her affection and appreciation for both Democratic candidates. A decision, if it was going to come at all, wasn't expected until later this year.

""I would like to see in a presidential candidate is one that has a coherent worldview and logic from which all these policy proposals are coming forward,"" Ocasio-Cortez told CNN in May. ""I think Sen. Sanders has that. I also think Sen. Warren has that. I also want to see us centering (on) working people in the United States to stem income inequality (and) tackle climate change.""

But as the primary heated up, with Warren surging and Sanders stalling in the polls, the process appeared to be speeding up.

On a late September weekend, the New York Democrat visited Burlington, Vermont, where she, Sanders and a couple of close aides met for dinner, according to a source familiar with discussions . They met against the next day for brunch. Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir later told CNN those discussions did not yield any firm commitment but had been ""a key step in the process.""

Elizabeth Warren committed for the first time on Sunday to putting out a plan detailing how ""Medicare for All"" would be funded, after facing criticism and being pressed on how she would pay for the national health insurance plan without raising taxes on the middle class.

""We need to talk about the cost, and I plan, over the next few weeks, to put out a plan that talks about specifically the cost of 'Medicare for All' and specifically how we pay for it,"" Warren said at a town hall in Indianola, Iowa, on Sunday. She told the crowd gathered that the plan ""is something I've been working for months and months, and it's got just a little more work until it's finished, but I want to bring this out.""

""I think there have been many estimates about what the cost will be, and many different payment streams, and I've been working on how to give the exact details to make that work,"" the Democrat told reporters on Sunday, adding later that she's ""ready to put out a plan soon on exactly what the costs will be, and how to pay for it.""

Warren's campaign said last week it was studying a range of options for paying for Medicare for All, leaving open the possibility that the senator may ultimately diverge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on how to pay for his sweeping health care plan -- which Warren has endorsed. Warren has not outlined her own health care plan , and instead is running on Sanders' single-payer legislation that she first signed on to in 2017.

Warren spoke for more than an hour at the event in Indianola before making the announcement. The campaign hoped she would simply mention her upcoming plan when asked about health care, but Warren was not asked the question at the town hall so she delivered this pre-planned message at the end of the event.

That's what BJ, who was living in Connecticut in 1971 and working as a bank teller, remembers about her first pregnancy. After she started to show, she had to work at a back desk away from the customers, she writes. Now living in North Carolina, BJ is one of the hundreds of women and men who wrote to us after CNN Opinion invited readers to share their experiences with pregnancy discrimination. When thinking about her own life and those of her three daughters and their pregnancies, she said, ""We have come a long way.""

When it emerged that Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren may have faced job discrimination over a pregnancy, the backlash against the claim was swift. One reason Warren's story of pregnancy discrimination prompted such an outcry from Americans on social media earlier this month and from so many of you in response to our call for stories is that for many American women -- and men -- the Pregnancy Discrimination Act feels too much like a historical footnote and little else. The Act amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to ""prohibit sex discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbrth, or related medical conditions."" Before it was signed into law in 1978, it was perfectly legal to refuse to hire, or to fire, a woman because of pregnancy.

Women who, like BJ, were working parents in the 1960s and 1970s, described what it was like seeking work as a woman of childbearing years before 1978; they recalled having to show prospective employers their birth control pills or disclose the dates of their last period to prove they weren't pregnant or wouldn't try to get pregnant if hired. Other women shared heartbreaking stories with us, ones not consigned to the pre-1978 past. Companies denying benefits after a stillbirth, demanding employees return to work one week after delivery.

For those women, it might come as no surprise to consider that as recently as this year, federal courts have been called upon to adjudicate pregnancy discrimination cases; in 2015, UPS lost a pregnancy discrimination case before the Supreme Court (in a decision that united Ruth Bader Ginsburg with Samuel Alito, two justices with very different judicial worldviews).

As recently as 2007, Melanie K. -- who worked for a staffing company and was a 39-year-old mother herself -- reported a client telling her, ""Don't bring me any women who are going to have kids."" When she asked in disbelief for clarification, her client -- a national company seeking IT professionals-- reiterated: ""Avoid any woman of child-bearing age.""

Several years after Melanie's experience, Becca K., of Cleveland, recalled her boss's words to her when she returned from maternity leave after her second child. She needed to ""dial it back to basics while getting back into the swing of things"" because ""changing diapers for three months isn't the same thing as managing a multimillion-dollar business."" For Laura Astorino of Massachusetts, the comments came from a founding partner at the firm where she worked (and where she was told she couldn't have a raise since she was going on maternity leave): he called employees with children ""breeders.""

For women today, pregnancy discrimination is ""is real, it is harrowing, and it is wrong,"" wrote our op-ed contributor Kara Alaimo

These stories of pregnancy discrimination weren't just about pregnancy -- they were also about miscarriage. They were also about adoption. They were also about supporting a pregnant partner.

I was told by my CEO that I couldn't use any of my sick leave because I wasn't theoretically 'sick'. (I was pregnant with twins and would likely have a Cesarean.) I asked the CEO if a man who has back surgery is considered 'sick'. He backed down. — Linda Avey (@lindaavey) October 9, 2019

Jeff from Provo, Utah -- now a stay-at-home dad and a writer -- was a college student when his wife lost the baby she was carrying. He described being told by one of his professors that he could only take time away from class if he provided his wife's medical documentation.

Angela from Oklahoma, wrote: ""I adopted my daughter at birth and I was basically told I wasn't going to get FMLA [12 unpaid weeks for employees who qualify under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993] for a decision I was making. However, the company policy would have allowed me to take time off if I had a drug problem, etc. Just not to take care of my child, because I CHOSE to have her, because I didn't give birth to her. I also CHOSE to leave that company.""

CNN Opinion reached out to you because Elizabeth Warren put pregnancy discrimination in the public eye and we wanted to know how you felt about it. Your willingness to share your most intimate, painful experiences humbled and honored us. Your responses showed us that for so many Americans -- past and present -- who are working to bring families into the world and support them, there are no easy answers.

""She's taken full advantage""

In 1996, I was a 4th year attorney starting a new job with a well-respected boutique firm in Houston. On my first day, one of the named partners took me to lunch. As we were entering the elevator, a visibily pregnant woman was exiting and the partner introduced her to me as one of their associates. Once on the elevator, he snidely said to me, ""This is Catherine's third child. She's taken full advantage of our maternity leave program."" I've never forgotten that comment or his tone and it definitely was in mind when I had my first, and only, child a few years later while still at the firm. I felt pressured to do a fair amount of work remotely during my 3 months of leave, so as to not damage my chance at partnership, which I eventually got. Catherine never made partner and eventually left, as I did in 2007.

I'm due in January. Things need to change

In 2011, I discovered I was pregnant after starting a new job. I work in a male-dominated field, and my pregnancy seemed to confuse my male bosses. My employer's response was, ""I've been in this industry for 10 years and I've never heard of such a thing!"" I assure you, my reproductive system works the same way as any other woman's. They didn't want to work with me on appointments. They didn't understand why I needed to miss hours for glucose tolerance testing, an amniocentesis, my anatomy scan. They were upset I could no longer lift 50 pounds or more.

I live in a state that isn't really pro-women's rights. I'd been on the job for 6 months when I was placed on modified bed rest for the last 4 weeks of my pregnancy. My company kept my job open. However, when I finally delivered, I was expected to return to work just two weeks later. I had a difficult delivery, and my doctor wouldn't authorize a return to work until 8 weeks postpartum. I didn't qualify for FMLA.

I lost that position. I was a single parent. The loss of income was devastating. I had to put my children on Medicaid to insure them. We went on SNAP for a while. In the end, I spent 18 months as a stay-at-home parent, and I cherish that time. But I'd rather have been employed.

Now, in 2019, seven years later, I find myself in the exact same position. I started a new job and discovered I was pregnant. Nothing has changed. If anything, the current environment is even more hostile to mothers in the workplace. I work for a really good company, so that helps, but I still find myself with no job protection. I still don't qualify for FMLA. My state still has no provision for pregnant women. Health care costs have skyrocketed, and as have the costs of having a baby.

I'm due in January. Things need to change. This country is lacking in women's rights. Many mothers would love to stay home with their new baby for a year [as other countries mandate in terms of paid leave]. We simply can't afford to. At the very least, we need a maternity program that isn't dependent on how long you've been working. Let us collect Social Security during that time. If our employers can't afford to hold our jobs, which is especially hard for smaller companies, let us collect unemployment. Humanity literally depends on women having babies. It's time for this country to realize that.

Men are also punished

When my wife was pregnant with our third child, we had some significant health scares for the baby requiring weekly ultrasounds. I didn't miss more work than I had sick time, but I used my accrued sick leave to help take care of my wife and children when needed. When the opportunity for promotion came up, my supervisor told me that they needed someone more dependable and that because I had taken so much time off to care for my family, I wouldn't be eligible. (I also never took time off for this without finding someone to cover as well.) I am sure that it is worse for the women who are pregnant, but men who actually take time off for pregnancy/paternity leave are also punished.

Discrimination isn't the problem. Entitlement is

Having a child as a working parent is difficult. I know because I have two children. Both were delivered via Caesarian and I was fortunate to have eight weeks with each baby after delivery. Before deciding to have children, consideration was given to the time and effort required to raise a child. It became glaringly apparent that parenting would not come without sacrifice. Never did my employer indicate that pregnancy, nursing or parenting would impact my job. Had they suggested that, I would not have blamed them. I spent 9 months mostly in the office bathroom vomiting (pre-delivery) and a significant amount of time pumping when I returned from maternity leave. Guess what, my male cohorts didn't.

I am not denying that there are ignorant people out there, but I think the prevalent problem facing us is that of entitlement. We want to be successful career women, but don't want to sacrifice having children. We want to have children, but expect to be given advantages, excuses, for sub-par performance. The reality is that life is about choices. I have made mine after careful consideration. Lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine. This is my experience. Please consider it as valid before dismissing it because it doesn't align with your storyline.

Pregnant? You still have to lift a Labrador retriever

I worked as a veterinary technician and was told that while they understood I could no longer assist with X-rays, I was expected to continue lifting dogs up to 75 lbs by myself and that I would not be allowed extra breaks or time off during my pregnancy. I considered quitting, but felt certain that another veterinary establishment would choose not to hire me if they knew I was pregnant.

What it was like the year the Pregnancy Discrimination Act became law

In 1978, I was a 21-year-old female interviewing for my first management position after college. I remember, distinctly, making it to the final round of interviews with four different corporations in which the hiring manager doing the final interview was always a white male. In three of the four interviews, I was asked when I was planning to get married and have children. My response was I wasn't in a relationship and couldn't see that happening for many years to come. After convincing them my career was my priority, each of these men followed up with a sentiment similar to, ""Of course you understand why we have to ask that question. Training new management recruits and investing in their careers is expensive. If you were to go off and start having babies, you wouldn't be able to give us the same level of commitment."" I was offered a position with all four corporations; I accepted a position with the corporation that never approached that question.

You're forced to choose and live with the consequences

I was a married PhD student. When my dissertation director found out I was expecting my first child, he was furious. ""You can't have a baby AND write a dissertation. It can't be done,"" he said. I did both, but had even more resistance about being a new mom when I defended my dissertation -- this time by the women on my committee. Even though they teach, higher ed is NOT mom-friendly. And this was in 2006!

I had another discriminatory incident when I gave birth to my second child. I was adjunct teaching at the university level and had my course load cut in half when my second child was born. I was told the cut would only last a semester, to accommodate my schedule, but the program director never reassigned the courses next semester. So my salary was permanently cut in half. I knew something like that would happen, and came back to work 3 weeks after giving birth to try to protect my job. Obviously, that didn't work.

This is the reality for women in America's higher education system. You're forced to choose, and live with the consequences. I just don't understand why Warren's comment is even a question. It happens every day.

With a baby in the NICU, I lost my job

I went into the hospital with pregnancy complications at 29 weeks and was [put on] 24-hour bed rest. I delivered my daughter 6 weeks early at 34 weeks. I notified my employer of her birth per being told to a few days later. I was then informed that I only had 2 weeks of leave left and would need to return to work after or be terminated. They ran my short-term disability and FMLA concurrently without telling me so I used up 6 out of the 8 weeks while on bed rest. I asked if I could work from home because I physically couldn't come back in two weeks (C-section delivery). It was up to my supervisor to approve and he denied stating he didn't believe I would truly work. With a new baby in the NICU and fresh from surgery, I was terminated from my job.

I never forgot the fear I had from my first pregnancy

I am Elizabeth Warren's vintage. Interviewing for my first professional job In 1978, I was pregnant but did not disclose it. Part of the hiring process was passing a physical. I actually prayed it would not disclose the pregnancy, knowing I would not get hired. After many months of working to make myself indispensable (and still hiding my pregnancy), I told my manager I would need a maternity leave. Annoyed, he said if he'd known I was pregnant he would not have hired me. Nevertheless, he did not fire me and I returned to work after a six-week leave. Four years later, I again became pregnant. My manager was then a VP and I was then a director. By that time, it was assumed I would take a leave and return to work, which I did. But I never forgot the fear I had from my first pregnancy.

""You better not be pregnant""

I was working at a law firm in 2014 and was called into my boss' office and he inappropriately told me that another attorney had just told him she was pregnant, so his direct quote to me was, ""She is pregnant so you better not be."" He then went on to tell me that only one of us could be pregnant on the team at once and that we all better coordinate that. The truth was I had just found out the day before that I was pregnant and was then completely terrified. I unfortunately suffered a miscarriage with that pregnancy, but knew that I would never be able to have a healthy pregnancy at that office. I had seen them fire a pregnant woman and also fire a woman who came back to work post pregnancy who was then hospitalized for severe postpartum depression. She was fired while still out on leave for her postpartum. I had also been told that my career would be ruined if I got pregnant. Rather than continue my career as a law firm attorney and continue in that environment, I chose to take a corporate job where I remain today, happily the mom of 2.

I've been one of the ""lucky"" ones

I went for an interview at 10 weeks pregnant. I had 2 previous consistent miscarriages, so I didn't feel comfortable disclosing I was pregnant. After I reached 16 weeks, out of joy and need for emotional support, I told my supervisor and the owner of the business I was pregnant. A week later, I was fired because ""I just wouldn't be happy there due to personality conflicts."" It took me 4 months, without unemployment benefits (which means all of our bills, rent and car payments fell way behind and my husband was pulling 12- to 14-hour shifts, 7 days a week, as well as being threatened with eviction every month) to find another place to work. By that time, my pregnant belly was already showing, and I had very limited choices since I would obviously need maternity leave within a few months. I've been one of the lucky ones who found an office full of new and experienced moms and I was hired and still work there now.

Three of my colleagues stood up for me

In 1998, I was the only female doctor in a medical clinic. When I got pregnant with my first child, the director told me I should find another job because managing a primary care practice after having a baby was not going to be possible. Fortunately for me the clinic nurse manager, a woman, and two of my male colleagues stood up for me. I had to make concessions and be in clinic 5 days a week in order to keep my job though. Twelve years later, I became the clinic director. By then the majority of our physicians were women and motherhood was not only accommodated but celebrated.

I am a better person today because I had kids

I became pregnant with my first daughter in 2015. I was working at a rapidly growing tech company in the Midwest, and I was quickly excelling in my career. The company was mostly male but still had some female representation. The problem was that I was the FIRST female to have a baby (while working there). As soon as I told my boss and HR I was pregnant, fear set in with everyone it seemed. How do we handle this? Where will she be able to pump that's private and NOT a bathroom (which is legally required)? I also learned that the company had a paternity leave policy but NO maternity leave. I could take unpaid FMLA but no paid leave -- I couldn't even save up vacation time to use after having the baby.

Once the management team was aware, I was told to announce this to the team. After the announcement, crickets. I was on an island now. No one knew what to do with me or how to work with me. The first question was, ""Are you leaving?"" At first, I said ""No!"" That answer quickly changed. I ended up quitting that job and staying home with my baby and working as a part-time freelancer for about 3 years. It was wonderful. I will never regret that decision. However, I am now managing a growing agency (based on continuous business growth from freelancing) and I will NEVER put one of my team members in that position. I want flexibility and freedom for moms and dads that I work with. I never want to lose talent and potential because someone chooses to have a child. I know I am a better person today than I was before I had kids. I work harder. I work smarter. And I credit a lot of that to being a mom AND a bad ass businesswoman.

In Thursday's letter, Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz blasted Facebook for what he called a ""deeply flawed"" policy, saying it gives ""blanket permission"" for candidates to use the platform to ""mislead American voters all while Facebook profits from their advertising dollars."" The ad was paid for by a political action committee called The Committee to Defend the President.

Schultz wrote that the campaign will continue to mount challenges, saying, ""In the coming days and weeks, Facebook will be hearing from us about these concerns, which are shared by countless other candidates, citizens, and organizations that prioritize the health of American democracy.""

In an email obtained by CNN from Facebook's head of global elections policy, Katie Harbath, Facebook replied that the ad in question is not currently active on the platform.

The ""Bernie's Back"" rally in Queensbridge Park, just outside the border of the congressional district Ocasio-Cortez was elected to represent last November, comes days after word that she and ""Squad"" ally Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota would endorse Sanders. Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan is expected to join them soon, potentially at an event later this month in her home district.

Speaking in the shadow of the Ravenswood Generating Station smokestacks, Ocasio-Cortez pointed to the site of the event as ""ground zero"" in the fight for ""environmental justice"" and, with the Queensbridge Houses, the largest development of its kind in the United States, to her left, public housing in America. The proximity of the plant to the apartment buildings, Sanders said later, was an example of the ""environmental racism"" his Green New Deal is designed to combat.

In her first public remarks since news of her endorsement spread, Ocasio-Cortez also praised the current field of Democratic presidential candidates as among the most progressive the party has ever seen -- and credited Sanders for paving the way. He returned the favor minutes later, as the pair clasped hands and raised their arms in triumph.

""I've been around politics a few years and it is hard to believe the degree to which in less than one year, this woman, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, it is hard to believe the degree to which she has transformed politics in America,"" Sanders said, praising Ocasio-Cortez as ""a fierce defender of the working class of our country"" and describing her as ""an inspiration to millions of young people, not just here in New York, but across this country, who now understand the importance of political participation and standing up for justice.""

Ocasio-Cortez told Sanders she would back him in a phone call while he was still in a Nevada hospital after a heart attack less than three weeks ago, aides to both confirmed, and news of her decision has been greeted as a welcome -- and validating -- shot of adrenaline inside a campaign that has stalled in most polling and was rattled, many on a very personal level, by Sanders' heart attack.

'I am more than ready'

Sanders and the surrogates who joined him made a point of hitting back against suggestions that he might be too old, or insufficiently fit, to win the White House next year. The 78-year-old Vermont independent was, per usual, particularly direct.

""I am happy to report to you that I am more than ready, more ready than ever to carry on with you the epic struggle that we have today,"" Sanders, who came onstage to AC/DC's ""Back in Black,"" said. ""I am more than ready to assume the office of President of the United States. I am more than ready to take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elites and their apologists ... To put it bluntly, I am back.""

A diverse crowd of Sanders supporters began to fill a stretch of the park in Northwest Queens, a hub of the progressive activism that helped scuttle Amazon's plans to build a new headquarters, here in Long Island City, hours before Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez took the stage.

Sanders' wife, Jane, declared her husband ""healthy"" and ""more than ready to continue his life-long struggle to fight for the working people of America. She was followed at the mic by filmmaker Michael Moore, who endorsed Sanders while scorning media coverage of the campaign.

""The only heart attack we should be talking about,"" Moore blared, ""is the one that Wall Street is going to have when Bernie Sanders is president.""

Sanders made his in-person return to the primary stage at Tuesday's CNN/The New York Times debate in Ohio . While Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, his fellow Senate progressive and leader in a number of recent polls, seemed to be at the center of every skirmish and the focal point of increasingly blunt attacks from the contest's centrist candidates, Sanders delivered one of his sharpest debate performances -- a showing that, at least for now, has seemed to quiet concerns over his health.

Saturday's rally, though, was something entirely different -- as Ocasio-Cortez, who had Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez have campaigned together before, during the summer of 2018, for progressive Democratic primary candidates.Saturday's rally, though, was something entirely different -- as Ocasio-Cortez, who had publicly weighed endorsing either Sanders or Warren, committed herself to his second crusade for the Democratic nomination.

Her endorsement underscored an argument the campaign has been making for months, which contends that Sanders is uniquely positioned to forge, as his campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, described it earlier this week, ""the multiracial working class coalition we need to win.""

Ari Rabin-Havt, Sanders' chief of staff, told CNN after the debate -- just a few hours after The Washington Post first reported on the endorsement -- that Ocasio-Cortez's decision would give new fuel to the ""movement"" that Sanders hopes will sweep him into the White House.

""This isn't about Bernie Sanders. This is about us,"" Rabin-Havt said. ""And this is what these endorsements are about. These are people who want a movement for change in this country. A movement for 'Medicare for All,' a movement for a Green New Deal, a movement on these issues. And you know, when Bernie Sanders says, 'Not me, us,' I think that message resonates with members of Congress who believe strongly in a movement.""

The endorsement, Justice Democrats Executive Director Alexandra Rojas said on the eve of the New York rally, is ""significant in the sense that it shows that the Bernie campaign is important to progressives and Democratic voters.""

""I know that Justice Democrats and myself (in this role) wouldn't even exist if it hadn't been for Bernie's 2016 presidential run,"" Rojas said. ""He has a young, racially diverse, totally working-class base of support, which is the same people that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez represents. She looks so much more like the grassroots base of the Democratic Party than Chuck Schumer, than Nancy Pelosi. And I think that's why the endorsement was so important for Bernie.""

Ocasio-Cortez had indicated in previous months that she could hold off in choosing a presidential candidate to support until later in the year, or even into the primaries, which begin in February with the Iowa caucuses. But rumors that she might get involved sooner heated up after a late September visit to Burlington, Vermont, where she, Sanders and a couple of close aides met for dinner, according to a source familiar with discussions, and then again the next day for brunch.

Shakir said Tuesday night that those conversations, while they did not lead to any kind of firm commitment, were ""a very key step in the process.""

""And then we, obviously, our teams worked together on a lot of details,"" Shakir said, referencing a rollout that had begun earlier that day when the campaign began teasing the appearance of a ""special guest"" at the New York rally.

Less than a week later, with Ocasio-Cortez watching on, Sanders looked ahead: ""I look forward,"" he said, ""to traveling with her all over this country.""

Mr. Trump accelerated the movement of working-class voters into the Republican Party, creating a GOP that now represents more middle- and lower-income Americans … He has reframed much of the Republican agenda to appeal to these voters, particularly on trade, immigration and foreign affairs, in many cases upending 40 years of GOP policy.

In turn, the Democrats are increasingly the party of America’s wealthiest cities, post-industrial business leaders, and the “woke” professional class.

This political transformation, however, means that U.S. college graduates have few friends in Washington, D.C., to protect their economic interests in a shifting economy.

The WSJ provides the data:

The Republican Party now represents more middle- and lower-income Americans than it did a decade ago. When all the U.S. House districts are ranked by median income, the GOP now represents 58% of the lower-income half of that spectrum, up from 39% of lower-income districts a decade ago. And it represents 34% of the higher-income half, down from 43% a decade ago.

But the shift also exacerbates the average voter’s tension with the GOP’s wealthier leadership class. The WSJ reported:

The most ardent Trump supporters agree with Mr. Trump’s restrictive positions on immigration and his opposition to efforts to address climate change, among other policies. The party-supporting Republicans believe immigration helps the nation and that near-term action to fight climate change is needed.

The share of white GOP members with college degrees has dropped from 40 percent in 2012 down to 29 percent in 2018., while the share of non-college grads has climbed from 50 percent in 2010 to 59 percent in 2018.

The WSJ did not discuss the impact of this shift on many college graduate voters who are drifting away from the GOP because of their sympathy for left-wing civic issues, such as global warming, sexual deregulation, and pro-diversity policies.

But these college graduate voters have yet to find economic allies in the pro-migration Democratic Party.

For example, Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for more immigration of “students,” which is likely a reference to young college graduates who will compete against American graduates:

We need a pathway to citizenship for the people who are here and here to stay … We need a path — not just for DREAMers — but also a path for grandmas, and for little kids, and for people who came here to work on farms, and for students who overstayed their visas. We need a path that is fair and achievable. Bring people out of the shadows. It is good for all workers, and we need to get them into our unions.

Similarly, Sen. Dick Durbin is touting legislation that would allow U.S. and Indian companies to bring in roughly 100,000 Indian white-collar workers each year.

GOP Sen. Kennedy blocks Dem Sen. Durbin's bill to skyrocket transfer of US college-jobs to Indian grads. Durbin's plan is much worse than Sen. Mike Lee's @S386 for US college grads & families. Part-Kabuki, but estb. journos act like frogs in a boiling pot. https://t.co/ZktjKG04MR — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 17, 2019

Meanwhile, investors are pressuring U.S. managers to replace many American graduates with cheaper foreign workers. On October 17, the San Jose Mercury News reported:

The San Francisco ride-hailing giant revealed in a California employment-department filing this month that it is laying off nearly 400 workers at its offices in the city and in Palo Alto. The filing showed software engineers at the firm were the hardest hit, with more than 125 people cut loose. Meanwhile, Uber this year received federal government approval for 299 new H-1B visas — work permits intended for jobs requiring specialized skills — compared with 152 in 2018 and 158 in 2017, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. It is unclear whether Uber plans to use all those visas or when new H-1B workers might be brought on. The visas typically cost thousands of dollars each to obtain. … “When they’re laying off, they shouldn’t be using H-1Bs at all, or maybe sparingly at best,” said Ron Hira, a Howard University professor who studies the use of the visa by companies. “It runs totally contrary to the intent of the H-1B program.”

Some of the labor markets for American college graduates are flooded with immigrants, admitted David Bier, an advocate at the Cato Institute, which favors easy immigration by foreign graduates:

The software engineer market, it’s so saturated with H-1Bs that some of the people who are laid off are almost inevitably H-1Bs and some of the people that are being hired are inevitably H-1Bs.

These investors get much support from some GOP legislators:

Watch GOP Sen. Mike Lee publicly urge Indian contract-workers to lobby US Senators for a bill offering fast-track citizenship to Indian grads if they take jobs (at low wages) from US grads. No GOP Sen. has rebuked him & no anti-GOP journos 'pounce.' Weird. https://t.co/A5VOsuyOVt — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 18, 2019

For the moment, Donald Trump’s administration is zig-zagging between the demands of its business allies and appeals from the swing-voting college graduate class.

(2/2) Moving and powerful. Lots of powerful competing interests, but we need to remember that the American immigration system is first and foremost supposed to be for the protection and benefit of America and Americans. — USCIS Acting Director Ken Cuccinelli (@USCISCuccinelli) October 18, 2019

“The president has made no secret of the fact that he believes immigration, first and foremost, is set up to work for America — that means economically and for the people here,” Cuccinelli told reporters at a press breakfast organized by the Christian Science Monitor.

Finding the right balance between helping American workers and American investors is a constant political dilemma, Cuccinelli said:

Is there some perfect [balanced] target point in every industry? Maybe there is, but we’re never going to be able to know it. So which side do you err on? And he has repeatedly emphasized how important it is to protect U.S. workers. Now’s he been clear with me, as well, and you all have heard him say it: he wants to see economic growth and dynamism. And that means, you know, growing companies needing to fill slots. So we’re just in a constant battle to balance those things."

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) claimed a larger crowd for his rally in Queens on Saturday than Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) claimed last month for her rally in Manhattan, signaling that he is far from ready to cede the primary fight.

Sanders’s campaign estimated that 26,000 people attended his rally, where he was formally endorsed by left-wing icon Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Though an independent crowd estimate was not reported, a security firm that worked at the event counted 25,872 attendees, according to the Washington Examiner. The Examiner said the city had issued a permit for 15,000 people in the local park, but that about 10,000 people watched from outside.

In contrast, Warren’s campaign estimated that 20,000 people showed up for her rally in Washington Square Park in the heart of lower Manhattan in September, though the park itself only holds 10,000, the maximum permitted for the event. Warren’s campaign has a consistent habit of exaggerating its crowd sizes; Biden rarely draws large crowds.

Though Warren now leads in many national polls of Democratic party presidential primary voters, especially in the states that will vote first, Sanders is still clinging to his spot among the three frontrunners, together with former Vice President Joe Biden. He used the rally to send the message that he has recovered from a heart attack just two weeks before. At 78, he is the oldest candidate in the race — though both Biden and Warren are also in their seventies.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) for president on MSNBC Friday evening and confidently said that Sanders “absolutely can win this.”

The Capitalism: A Love Story director officially threw his weight behind Sanders during an appearance on MSNBC. While Moore said he loves Warren and has for years, he believes Sanders is the right man for the job, citing the lawmaker’s understanding of the “greedy form of capitalism.”

“Why me for Bernie?” Moore began. “Because Bernie understands that capitalism and the greedy form of capitalism – especially what we have now – is at the core of so many of the problems that we’re talking about. And he’s not afraid to come out and just say that– that that’s a problem.”

“And you think he’s in a position to win the nomination and be president?” host Ari Melber asked.

“Oh absolutely,” Moore said, citing an Emerson Poll released this week.

“I mean there was the Emerson Poll in Iowa yesterday, showed a head to head with Bernie, Biden, and Elizabeth,” the Sicko producer said. “Only one of them came out ahead of Trump, and that was Bernie Sanders. He’s absolutely — absolutely can win this.”

The poll Moore referenced showed both Joe Biden (D) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) leading the Democrat field in the Hawkeye State with 23 percent each, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with 16 percent, and Sanders dropping to fourth with 13 percent support. However, Moore is correct, as the hypothetical general election matchups show Trump besting Biden and Warren by two points – 51 percent to 49 percent – and Sanders leading Trump by the same, with 51 percent to Trump’s 49 percent. However, with a margin of error of +/-3.2, the candidates are in a virtual dead heat in Iowa.

Moore is expected to formally endorse Sanders alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) at the “Bernie’s Back” rally in New York City Saturday afternoon."

Then, on Friday, Hillary Clinton herself kept the smear campaign going, saying in a podcast hosted by Barack Obama’s former campaign manager David Plouffe that Russia is grooming Gabbard to be a third party candidate.

“I’m not making any predictions, but I think they’ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,” Clinton said. “She’s the favorite of the Russians.”

Gabbard lashed back at the Democratic Party’s 2016 presidential nominee, tweeting in response, “Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain.”

Days before Gabbard appeared on the debate stage in Ohio, she had threatened to boycott the event, because she believes the DNC is rigged against outsider candidates such as herself. She declared that the Democratic National Committee and the “corporate media” were “trying to hijack the entire election process.”

Among other reasons, Gabbard argued that the polls the DNC chose for certifying the candidates for the November debate were not as accurate as many of the non-certified polls that could actually help her qualify. So far, the only candidates who have qualified for November are former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

But the media smears, and the evident bias of the debate hosts, were the driving force.

Two days after Gabbard’s threat, the New York Times published what she called “ a greatest hits smear piece.” Gabbard later noted: “These are the folks who will be acting as the neutral questioners/moderators of Tuesday’s debate lol!”

At the debate itself, Gabbard took aim at the hosts: “Just two days ago the New York Times put out an article saying that I’m a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning a CNN commentator said on national television that I’m an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.”

It was actually very kind of Gabbard to not mention the name attached to the CNN smear. Bakari Sellers said hours before the event that he firmly believed that Tulsi is a ‘puppet for the Russian government.”

The fact is that Gabbard, a reservist in the U.S. Army National Guard who took time off her campaign to drill with her unit this summer, is more cautious about the use of military force than other candidates. For that, she is being attacked as a traitor.

But it is a stance that has appeal to members of both parties who are weary of interventionist foreign policies.

Another political outsider, former Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX), is a Tulsi Gabbard fan. Paul praised Gabbard when he said, “She’s the most intelligent and would be the best. “ He also said, “If we had to pick one of them [Democrats] to be our president I think she would be giving us the best chance as for bringing about peace.”

Gabbard is a proud veteran who founded and is the co-chair of the Congressional Post 9/11 Veteran Caucus, which demonstrates her continual work in defending the work her military brothers and sisters continue to do to fight for their country.

At the debate, when Gabbard calmly asked if she could ask Warren a question, she was cut off. Silenced by the very media who smeared her, as if to protect Warren.

Yet Gabbard, as after the second debate, was the most googled candidate after the candidates left the stage.

Apparently American want to hear more from Tulsi despite the smears. The Times called Gabbard’s supporters “unusual Americans”; that has now become a rallying cry.

These “Unusual Amerians” include the ”unconventional mix of anti-interventionist progressives, libertarians, [and] contrarian culture-war skeptics…” that the Times mocked as Gabbard’s base by associating them with extremists.

Gabbard delivered a powerful response in her closing statement at the debate: “I don’t see deplorables. I see fellow Americans worthy of respect even when we disagree strongly.”

Gabbard’s use of the word “deplorables” was a clear allusion Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables,” a phrase that the former secretary of state used to tarnish her opponent’s supporters back in 2016. It came back to haunt Clinton — as will her declaration that Gabbard is Russia’s favorite.

Gabbard, unlike Clinton and many of the presidential hopefuls in 2020, has sacrificed for her country through her military service in a combat zone, and understands the cost of war from first-hand experience.

That is the simple secret of her appeal. It is amazing how far the corporate media and the party establishment will go in their attempt to stop that message from breaking through.

The mayor’s mention of President Trump prompted many Sanders supporters to chant “Lock Him Up” — a play on the “Lock Her Up” slogan synonymous with failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

“You know what? Let’s vote him out,” Cruz responded to attendees, before leading a “Vote Him Out” chant.

Cruz has repeatedly criticized President Trump’s response to Hurricane Maria, which killed 3,057 people across the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico in September 2017. Yet, it is Cruz and other members of her administration that are under investigation by the FBI for allegedly keeping supplies from reaching the victims.

The “Bernie’s Back “rally marked the Sanders campaign’s first rally since the 78-year-old suffered a heart attack two weeks ago.

Storming past questions about his health, Sanders vowed that he’s “more ready than ever” to fight for a political revolution — with a little help from new friends — at his rally that drew thousands to a New York City park. The rally offered a pointed reminder to skeptics in both political parties that the democratic socialist is still very much a force in the presidential race.

Sanders opened his remarks by apologizing that he secured a permit for only 20,000 people. His campaign, he said, was forced to close the gates on many more people who were trying to enter the Queens park just across the river from Manhattan.

“To put it bluntly, I am back,” Sanders declared, sparking chants of, “Bernie is back” from the massive crowd.

“I am happy to report to you that I am more than ready — more ready than ever — to carry on with you on the epic struggle that we face today,” he added. “I am more than ready to assume the office of president of the United States.”

The event marked Sanders’ formal return to the campaign trail less than three weeks after he suffered a heart attack that threatened both his life and political future. Even before that, he was in danger of falling out of the top-tier in the 2020 Democratic primary field. Polls suggest he’s lagging behind liberal rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and establishment favorite former Vice President Joe Biden.

Warren, with Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) where she demands that transgender border crossers and illegal aliens be released into the U.S. rather than being held in Mexico under President Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy.

“While in detention, transgender migrants and asylum seekers are particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment, discrimination, and abuse,” Warren writes in the letter. “The United States should protect individuals fleeing persecution and targeted violence, including persecution based on gender identity or expression — not subject them to further harm.”

“Trans migrants and asylum seekers are particularly vulnerable,” Warren wrote on Twitter. “We must end unnecessary detention and enforce strict standards to keep trans migrants and asylum seekers safe — and I’ll continue holding our government accountable when they fail to do so.”

The demand for transgender border crossers to be released into the U.S. interior is the latest case Warren has made for open borders while on the campaign trail.

Most recently, Warren outlined a plan to provide back pay to all illegal aliens who are determined to have been underpaid or unpaid for previous work, Breitbart News reported. Likewise, Warren has said that border crossers must not be “unnecessarily” detained and instead freed into the interior of the U.S. and has claimed that driving up foreign competition in the labor market by providing amnesty to 11 million to 22 million illegal aliens is “good” for American workers.

Though Warren has taken a populist-nationalist stance on various economic policies, her plan to support more immigration to the U.S. is a key component of the globalist agenda supported by the nation’s donor class.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Monday unveiled her public education proposal, which includes halting the “privatization” of public schools, stopping vouchers, enhancing protections for illegal immigrant students, and quadrupling Title I funding.

While there are many facets to Warren’s plan, she devotes a significant section to combating the “privatization” of public schools. It is necessary, Warren says, to “resist efforts to divert public funds out of traditional public schools.” She continued:

To keep our traditional public school systems strong, we must resist efforts to divert public funds out of traditional public schools. Efforts to expand the footprint of charter schools, often without even ensuring that charters are subject to the same transparency requirements and safeguards as traditional public schools, strain the resources of school districts and leave students behind, primarily students of color.

Because of that, Warren is calling for the end of vouchers, tuition tax credits, and federally-funded expansions of charter schools. She also calls for a full ban of for-profit charter schools.

“We should stop the diversion of public dollars from traditional public schools through vouchers or tuition tax credits – which are vouchers by another name,” she wrote.

“We should fight back against the privatization, corporatization, and profiteering in our nation’s schools,” she added.

That stands in contrast with the position Warren took in the past, particularly ahead of her 2012 senatorial campaign. She actually championed vouchers and assessed that they “take pressure off parents” in terms of having to purchase homes in neighborhoods zoned for desirable schools. She added that vouchers encourage competition and produce results, creating something “parents can buy into and believe in.”

Warren also painted a dire picture of a public education system, where both segregation and discrimination are, she believes, running rampant.

“But broad public affirmation of the Brown v. Board of Education decisions in the 1950s and recent debates about historical desegregation policies have obscured an uncomfortable truth – our public schools are more segregated today than they were about thirty years ago,” Warren claimed, weaving in her “Housing Plan for America” as a viable solution for these issues and ignoring her past calls for vouchers, which 2011 Warren suggested would help remedy the disparity.

Additionally, the presidential hopeful’s plan enhances protections for illegal immigrant students, calling the Trump administration’s immigration policies “inhumane” and attributing them to the increase of fear among illegal immigrant families. She said:

Immigration makes America stronger – economically, socially, and culturally. But because of the Trump Administration’s inhumane immigration policies, many immigrant students are afraid to go to school, and many families living in the shadows are afraid to access resources like free school lunch. I would end the Trump’s Administration’s monstrous policies and enact immigration reform that is fair, humane, and reflects our values. I will ensure immigrant students don’t get second-class status by being directed into GED programs instead of classrooms. I will protect sensitive locations like schools from immigrant enforcement actions. And I’ll recommit OCR to upholding and enforcing Plyler v. Doe – which the Trump administration has tried to undermine – so that all immigrant children have access to a quality education, no matter their native language, national origin, immigration status, or educational history.

She also promises to affirm the rights of LGBT students by reinstating the “guidance revoked under Trump about transgender students’ rights under Title IX, and make clear that federal civil rights law prohibits anti-LGBTQ+ rules like discriminatory dress codes, prohibiting students from writing or discussing LGBTQ+ topics in class, or punishing students for bringing same-sex partners to school events.”

In another section, Warren pledges to push a guidance that would “limit the use of discriminatory dress codes targeting student dress and hairstyle,” which she says leads to “students of color losing valuable learning time and Muslim students being denied participation in school activities.”

Warren’s plan also proposes the cancelation of student breakfast and lunch debt, as well as free school meals and free universal pre-K, which she has said she would pay for via her “wealth tax.”

“It’s time to live up to the promise of a high-quality public education for every student,” Warren wrote. “My plan makes big, structural changes that would help give every student the resources they need to thrive.”"

Don't lose sight of this amazing fact: Astronaut and first-time Senate candidate Mark Kelly had more money in the bank ($9.5 million) than Joe Biden's presidential campaign ( $8.98 million ) at the end of September.

That's Joe Biden. The three-plus decade senator. The eight-year vice president. The front-runner in the 2020 race since the moment he got into it. (Until now, that is. More on that below.)

Biden's fundraising problems aren't actually all that surprising. He's never been much of a fundraiser -- or enjoyed doing it. And he never built the small-dollar national network that more liberal candidates likes Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren have accrued.

None of those rationalizations change the fact that Biden has considerably less money to spend in the final 100 days before people start voting that any of his top rivals -- including Sanders, Warren and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

How can Biden change that reality? He probably can't. If he wasn't able to raise money well (and easily) as the clear front-runner, he's going to have a much harder time convincing people to give him money given the changing dynamics in the contest.

4. Bernie's back?: That's the message coming out of Sanders' campaign as he seeks to change the subject from his recent heart attack and the is-he-too-old-for-this? conversation that event has spurred.

Sanders' efforts to move on got a big boost over the weekend when New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed him over Warren. ""It wasn't until I heard of a man by the name of Bernie Sanders that I began to question and assert and recognize my inherent value as a human being who deserves health care, housing, education and a living wage,"" Ocasio-Cortez said at a rally announcing her 2020 pick

What happens next? Well, Sanders has the AOC endorsement as well as $30+ million in the bank -- two very good things with about 100 days left until Iowa. The question now becomes: Does he have another issue on the campaign trail related to his health or age? If not, Sanders' heart attack might seem like a million years ago by the time Iowa Democrats turn out to vote in the caucuses. But if Sanders has any sort of problem between now and then, it's likely the end of his campaign.

3. The super-weird Hillary vs. Tulsi dynamic: Hillary Clinton started Hillary Clinton started one of the strangest news cycles in the 2020 race at the end of the last week when she seemed to suggest that the Russians were ""grooming"" Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to run as a third-party candidate. Gabbard, thrilled with the unexpected chance to battle with one of the biggest figures in the party, called Clinton the ""queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.""

What now? Well, Buttigieg gave the story a bit more fuel Sunday morning. ""I don't know what the basis is for that,"" he said of Gabbard on CNN's ""State of the Union"" with Jake Tapper. ""But I consider her to be a competitor. I respect her service.""

Does this become a story that all of the major contenders on the Democratic side have to respond to? And do any of them take it as an opportunity to distance themselves from the Clinton era that many Democrats would like to put behind them?

2. Trump slump ... dump?: I'm hesitant to predict any sort of major walk-away from President Donald Trump by congressional Republicans over the Ukraine scandal because, well, they haven't walked away from him over all of the other terrible stories surrounding him over his first three-ish years in office.

And yet, there are cracks. Over the weekend, former Ohio Gov. John Kasich announced that he supported the impeachment and removal of Trump. Florida Rep. Francis Rooney, a Republican, said he would consider impeaching Trump -- and then promptly announced his plan to retire from Congress in 2020

The question is whether any more fissures emerge following Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney's admission that there was a quid pro quo between the US and Ukraine to force an investigation into the Democratic National Committee's physical server. (Trump -- and Mulvaney, I suppose? -- believe the server might be in Ukraine. It's not.

There is somewhat clear evidence that Trump is melting down amid the pressures applied by the House impeachment inquiry. The latest evidence? His Saturday night reversal on plans announced Thursday to hold the 2020 G7 summit at his Doral club in Miami.

Is there any scenario in which Republicans say enough is enough and begin to break from Trump publicly in big numbers? If it's possible, we might be on the verge of it.

1. The new Democratic front-runner ... now what?: There's a new top dog in the Democratic field: Elizabeth Warren. There's a new top dog in the Democratic field: Elizabeth Warren. As Harry Enten and I noted in our brandnew rankings of the 10 Democrats most likely to wind up as the party's nominee, Warren has overtaken Biden not just in polling but also in money and organization. She also has the clearest path to be the nominee, with a polling and organizational edges in Iowa and a geographic connection in New Hampshire.

So now what? Well, last week's debate is an indicator of what this next phase of the Democratic race will look like -- as the Massachusetts senator was attacked for a variety of her positions by no fewer than seven of her rivals. (Warren did the best she could amid the onslaught, but no one could be expected to prosper under those circumstances.)

Warren's most obvious weakness -- from a policy perspective -- is on her ongoing unwillingness to state, clearly, whether or not middle-class families will see their taxes go up under her ""Medicare for All"" plan. The answer to that is almost certainly yes -- as Sanders, another ""Medicare for All"" proponent, acknowledged in the debate."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) proposed to end school vouchers in her public education plan released Monday despite praising them in the past for helping “take the pressure off parents” and encouraging competition.

Warren released her extensive plan on the public education system in America on Monday, which offered a swath of pledges, from protecting illegal immigrant families to promising an additional $450 billion in Title I funding over the next decade.

One of the most significant aspects of the presidential hopeful’s proposal, however, is her call to end school vouchers. Warren argues that the voucher system leaves minority students behind and called to end federal funding for new charter schools.

Vouchers (or school choice), Warren asserts, hurt minorities and result in school segregation and discrimination. She harkened to her housing plan, which gives states funds to build desirable parks and schools “if they eliminate the kinds of restrictive zoning laws that can further racial segregation”

“And it includes a historic new down payment assistance program that promotes integration by giving residents of formerly redlined areas help to buy a home in any community they choose,” Warren says.

However, Warren’s pitch stands in stark contrast to the solution she offered in years past. During an interview with Fox Business in May 2011, Warren praised vouchers, essentially arguing that they helped solve the problem that she explicitly outlined in the plan released Monday.

She said that school vouchers alleviated pressure from parents and essentially fostered an environment of competition “that really produces results and parents can buy into and believe in.”

Warren said (emphasis added):

The point is, we have a private school system now, only the way it’s doled out is instead of paying tuition, you buy a house in a certain zip code and pay taxes and keep everyone locked out who’s not in that zip code. We call those public schools. But look at the financing for them. If every child in the state of Massachusetts — every child in this country — got a ticket, and the ticket was funded by taxpayers, because I believe in public education, but it could be used at any school regardless of what kind of house parents can afford to buy, it would first take the pressure off parents in terms of having to buy those houses, and second would mean that those schools now compete with each other for offering the kind of education that really produces results and parents can buy into and believe in.

Warren previewed that position years before in her 2003 book, The Two-Income Trap.

“But the public-versus-private competition misses the central point. The problem is not vouchers; the problem is parental choice,” Warren wrote — a line that stands in stark contrast to her current plan to take away parental choice by ending vouchers.

“Under current voucher schemes, children who do not use the vouchers are still assigned to public schools based on their zip codes. This means that in the overwhelming majority of cases, a bureaucrat picks the child’s school, not a parent,” she continued, as quoted by the Wall Street Journal.

Warren carried that position into her 2012 senatorial campaign, even publicly supporting charter schools.

“Warren holds some positions on education that challenge union orthodoxy. For instance, she favors charter schools and the use of student test scores as a factor in evaluating teachers, as long as teachers help craft the evaluations,” the Boston Globe reported in March 2012.

The presidential hopeful’s plan on Monday, though, laments the existence of vouchers and charter schools.

“We have a responsibility to provide great neighborhood schools for every student. We should stop the diversion of public dollars from traditional public schools through vouchers or tuition tax credits – which are vouchers by another name,” she wrote, adding that we must “fight back against the privatization, corporatization, and profiteering in our nation’s schools.”"

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez never hid from the fact that choosing between Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, as she weighed her 2020 presidential endorsement, would be a difficult one.

She was open, when asked, about her affection and appreciation for both Democratic candidates. A decision, if it was going to come at all, wasn't expected until later this year.

""I would like to see in a presidential candidate is one that has a coherent worldview and logic from which all these policy proposals are coming forward,"" Ocasio-Cortez told CNN in May. ""I think Sen. Sanders has that. I also think Sen. Warren has that. I also want to see us centering (on) working people in the United States to stem income inequality (and) tackle climate change.""

But as the primary heated up, with Warren surging and Sanders stalling in the polls, the process appeared to be speeding up.

On a late September weekend, the New York Democrat visited Burlington, Vermont, where she, Sanders and a couple of close aides met for dinner, according to a source familiar with discussions . They met against the next day for brunch. Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir later told CNN those discussions did not yield any firm commitment but had been ""a key step in the process.""

(CNN) There are two plans afoot to oust President Donald Trump. One, impeachment, has transfixed Washington. But the earth is also moving in the other: the 2020 Democratic race.

The smoke has cleared from last week's CNN/New York Times debate , and Sen. Elizabeth Warren has suddenly emerged as the hot ticket for nomination, shaking up assumptions the race is former Vice President Joe Biden's to lose. But Warren is significantly to the left of much of middle America, and her proposals could spook voters -- even many of those who want Trump gone.

It's not impossible that Warren, who wants massive social and structural change in health care, taxation, education and the economy, could herald a political realignment. After all, Washington is often the last to get the news. No one here predicted how Trump ripped the Republican Party from its corporate, country club, internationalist roots and turned it into a working class, populist, anti-elite, isolationist force. But she's still a risky bet. And Trump is itching to run against what he's branding far left-wing ""socialism.""

(This is not just an American conundrum. It could shape the looming UK election as well, where Labour's Jeremy Corbyn hopes to become the most radical Prime Minister in generations — but could end up handing power back to the unpopular Tories.)

First voting is more than three months away, and Warren's boom has woken up centrists like Biden, small town Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. But sooner or later, Democratic primary voters -- generally far more progressive than the country as a whole -- will face a fundamental question: How far left is too far?

'Fascists, racists and Venus-ians'

Matteo Salvini, leader of Italy's far-right League party, reportedly mocked concerns that his weekend rally would attract fascists , joking that it would also bring people from the planet Venus. The event was held with fellow right-wing leaders Silvio Berlusconi and Giorgia Meloni in Rome -- just a few days short of the anniversary of Benito Mussolini's famous ""March on Rome.""

Kiu scias?

Remember covfefe?

In a new linguistic faux pas on Sunday, Trump substituted ""Esperanto,"" the globalist's dream language, for ""Esper,"" the surname of his Defense Secretary Mark Esper.

Was the President the victim of predictive text or a rogue spell checker in his since-deleted tweet? Or -- could he actually not know the name of the man he put in charge of the most lethal military in history? Kiu scias?

'Between MAGA hats and black mamas'

Impeachment forces lawmakers into tough choices; their vote on this most crucial of questions could doom them or pave the way to reelection.

No one is in a dicier spot than Doug Jones, the Democratic senator from fiercely pro-Trump Alabama. He won office on a wave of support from African American voters, among whom the President is deeply unpopular. Now, as CNN's Van Jones put it, the senator will be stuck ""between MAGA hats and black mamas"" when it's time to vote.

'That's not what I said'

What's got into Mick Mulvaney? The acting White House chief of staff has suddenly developed a most un-Trumpian compulsion to blurt out the truth.

In Thursday's train-wreck of a news conference , Mulvaney effectively admitted there was a quid pro quo with Ukraine -- the central allegation of Democrats' impeachment case. ""That's not what I said. That's what people said I said,"" he said on ""Fox News Sunday"" before being presented with video evidence of his comment.

When he was asked about Trump's aborted decision to host the G7 summit at one of his Florida resorts, he admitted, ""People think it looks lousy,"" referring to fears of self-dealing. Then he offered this excuse: ""(Trump) still considers himself to be in the hospitality business.""

Of course, as President, Trump is supposed to have walled himself off from his hotel and real estate empire to avoid conflicts of interest. Mulvaney's suggestion of the exact opposite makes this the second time in three days his frankness has people asking how long before he's sacked. CNN reported Sunday that Trump's already having second thoughts.

Mulvaney could be getting it all out into the open, with an aim to minimize and normalize behavior that would once have been thought impeachable. But he may also be about to join an infamous DC club of power brokers remembered for their classic ""Washington gaffes"" -- as defined by former CNNer and New Republic editor Michael Kinsley.

A Washington gaffe, of course, is when a politician messes up and tells the truth.

'If the nesting doll fits...'

That's how Hillary Clinton's spokesman Nick Merrill responded when Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard rejected the former secretary of state's claim that she was being groomed for a third-party run by Russia.

Clinton must still be simmering at the role the Russians played in helping Trump win in 2016 (she also accused former Green Party candidate Jill Stein of being a Moscow ""asset."") But her attack could backfire: First, she's elevating Gabbard, who barely registers in most polls. Second, evoking a Kremlin puppet master revives the mistrust seeded by the original Russian operation. It's the meddling scam that just keeps on giving.

(CNN) While the latest head-to-head polls show President Donald Trump trailing Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren , translating those polls into votes for the Democratic nominee next fall won't be easy.

Earlier this month, Elizabeth Warren announced that she would not hold big-dollar fundraisers , even if she becomes the Democratic nominee. Within hours, though, her aides added a caveat: This pledge did not apply to fundraisers she would do on behalf of the Democratic National Committee.

This important addendum should come as no surprise to those who have been following the problems at the DNC for the last several years. With just one year left before election day, the DNC doesn't have the money , the data or the team to adequately support the eventual nominee. Filings from late September reveal an anemic DNC mired in debt while the RNC has senior staff set up already in a whopping 19 states

Elizabeth Warren, and every other candidate who appeared on the debate stage last week, knows that it will be nearly impossible to win the White House without a competent national party apparatus — especially if there is a protracted fight for the nomination that stretches into the spring.

Voter turnout is what will ultimately decide who wins the 2020 election. This election will not be about winning over undecided voters with television ads. There are few undecided voters, now that nearly every American has an opinion about President Trump (only 5% have ""no opinion"" about his job performance). But it doesn't matter whether more than half of voters want him out of the White House if they don't show up to vote when it counts.

That's why money — and enough time to spend it — matters.

Turning out voters takes enormous resources on the ground in every state. It takes money far enough in advance that a campaign can build out a ground game with enough time to identify middle- to low-propensity voters, target them with digital ads that are laser-focused on their interests and bombard them with information to get them to the polls at the right place and on the right day.

It takes field staff knocking on the right doors at the right time so that a candidate banks as many votes as possible when early voting starts. That makes it easier come Election Day, when field staff can focus on targeting the remaining stragglers. It's a game of millimeters.

(This is why Hillary Clinton and her team sound silly when they crow about winning the popular vote in 2016. All that means is they wasted time and money targeting the wrong voters. I assure you that the Trump team didn't waste a moment's thought on getting extra votes in Texas. They spent their resources in, you guessed it, Pennsylvania Wisconsin, and Michigan .)

Let's step back a moment. Last week, The New York Times published an in-depth story about voters in a swing county in Pennsylvania. The interview that opens the piece is with Mark Graham, an Obama voter who switched to supporting Trump in 2016. He hasn't been impressed by the President's performance (he called Trump's behavior ""a joke""), but after watching the Democratic primary debates in September, he told the Times he couldn't back any of the Democrats either.

Then came the political chaos of the past few weeks. Now Graham says, ""I'd vote for the Democratic nominee no matter who it is at this point."" Upon reading that, the DNC may be gaining confidence -- that's one more vote in Pennsylvania, right?

But do you see the problem? Graham doesn't actually like any of the Democratic candidates on that stage; he just happens to like Trump less. He's what you'd have in your database as a high-propensity voter (he votes every four years) with a low attachment score for the eventual nominee (he's not particularly motivated to vote for the Democrat).

Graham is not undecided -- but once the general election is here and he's bombarded with negative ads about the Democratic nominee on social media, specifically targeted to his interests, Graham may well throw up his hands and decide not to vote at all.

This means the DNC needs someone to visit Mr. Graham and remind him of all the things he's feeling right now about President Trump and make sure he doesn't decide to stay home in November of 2020. He doesn't need to hear more about Medicare for All canceling his private insurance; he needs to hear about President Trump's latest mess.

But who's going to knock on that door? And, unless The New York Times writes a profile on every voter in Erie, how will the DNC know who else to talk to and what to say?

While the Democratic primary candidates are raising gobs of money , they are also spending it largely in ways designed to help them defeat their fellow Democrats in the primaries, not to defeat Donald Trump in the general election.

On the one hand, Democratic contenders are building miniature ground games in early primary states, which would be good, except that Pennsylvania and Ohio are not early primary states. You don't need a ground game in South Carolina to beat Donald Trump come next fall.

Building those early ground games, of course, is exactly why the party committees exist. But the DNC isn't exactly inspiring confidence that the organization will be ready for the fight come 2020.

New FEC reports were filed last night and the gulf continues to widen. The DNC raised under $7 million , with $8.6 million on hand and more than $7 million in debt. The Republican National Committee, on the other hand, raised more than $27 million and has over $59 million on hand with no debt. This means the Trump campaign and the RNC combined in the third quarter to raise over $125 million.

Add that to the multiple staff shakeups at various Democratic party committees and, well, yikes.

Voters have strong feelings about the President and about the direction of the Democratic Party . But feelings don't equal turnout. A recent experiment , for example, showed that Democratic voters who were exposed to news coverage about some of the left-leaning policy positions taken by Democratic candidates at the debate became slightly more enthusiastic about voting for the eventual nominee of their party.

But the survey also showed two big red flags. First, independents who read about the party's leftward turn were 6% less likely to vote Democratic.

Second, the experiment also found that the results ""did not indicate [Democratic voters] were more motivated to vote and campaign for the eventual nominee than those who hadn't read about them.""

This is why campaigns and parties spend hundreds of millions of dollars on targeted digital ads, and on building a robust ground game. And while the President may be turning off non-white voters in Florida , Democrats aren't going to win that state or any other swing state unless their voters actually show up to—you guessed it—vote.

But the eventual Democratic nominee won't have a field army to greet them at the Panhandle gates.

We may spend a lot of time talking about the polls in the media, but the candidates who appeared on last week's debate stage would be wise to remember: Polls don't vote."

""I think we need to be really honest with people right now.""

It's lost on no one, of course, she's talking about Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

After making that point clear during the debate last week in Ohio -- calling for a ""reality check to Elizabeth"" and dismissing some Warren plans as ""pipe dreams"" -- Klobuchar is scrambling to turn her moment on stage into momentum on the campaign trail.

Klobuchar, who has so far qualified for all of the primary debates but continues to see single-digit polling numbers, is in danger of missing the November debate stage.

With less than a month to qualify, a fresh sense of urgency surrounded her candidacy as her green campaign bus rumbled across Iowa on a visit this past weekend. Her itinerary was shaped by a swath of counties President Donald Trump turned red in 2016 that President Barack Obama twice carried.

At every stop, whether shaking hands with one potential supporter at a time or addressing a room of a few hundred, Klobuchar made the case again and again: She can win in Trump country and Democrats can ill afford to choose a nominee who can't.

In this unsettled stage of the race, she's testing the appetite for whether hard-core party activists who dependably attend Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses are open to backing a candidate who promotes her progressive record even as she touts the number of Republicans -- or former Republicans -- who approach her to pledge their support.

""Who do you want heading that ticket? Someone who can really win in the Midwest,"" Klobuchar told CNN in an interview aboard her chartered bus, emblazoned with the slogan ""Amy for America"" in giant letters. ""I'm the only one with the track record of actually winning red congressional districts time and time again and suburban purple districts.""

The Minnesota senator carried so-called Trump counties -- 42 of them, she proudly pointed out to her Iowa audiences, as she won a third Senate term last fall. She argues that her presidential candidacy could also build a broader coalition to help Democratic candidates win control of the Senate next year.

But in the short term, it's an open question whether her pragmatic message can be a winning one in the crowded 2020 Democratic primary.

""She has a very refreshing, common sense way about her that is very appealing,"" said Andy McKean, a longtime Iowa state legislator who left the Republican Party earlier this year in disgust. Now a Democrat, he endorsed Klobuchar, saying: ""She's very practical, but she's very progressive.""

It's that balance Klobuchar is working to navigate.

Her rising confidence, which was apparent on the debate stage last week in Ohio, clearly followed her at most every stop of her three-day Iowa visit. One voter after another conceded they took notice of her for the first time when she aggressively challenged Warren on the price tag of her health care plan.

Betsy Pilkington, a retired teacher from North English, Iowa, said she was so impressed by Klobuchar's most recent debate performance that she went online and made a small contribution. It was the biggest fundraising boomlet of Klobuchar's campaign, aides said, raising more than $1 million in the first 24 hours after the debate. (By comparison, Klobuchar raised a total $4.8 million from July to September.)

""For the first time, I thought she came across more forceful and she was a force to recon with,"" Pilkington said in an interview after meeting Klobuchar at a coffee shop along her tour. ""I liked what she had to say, that she was more centrist and she wasn't afraid to go up against Elizabeth Warren.""

Pragmatic and progressive

Klobuchar and Warren, who are colleagues in the Senate and competitors on the campaign trail, illustrate the tensions coursing through the Democratic Party and the lingering uncertainty over what type of candidate is the most electable.

The root of their disagreement is over the price tag of a series of programs, including ""Medicare for All"" and free college. Klobuchar was among the Democrats who did not sign onto the sweeping legislation sponsored by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, which would eliminate private health insurance.

In the wake of persistent questioning of Warren on the debate stage from Klobuchar and others, the Massachusetts senator said Sunday for the first time that she is working on a plan to pay for Medicare for All and would reveal it in the coming weeks.

That development prompted this reply from Klobuchar: ""I think if she had a good answer, we would have seen it by now. But I look forward to seeing it.""

Their candidacies are far from equal -- Warren's robust grassroots fundraising prowess and wild enthusiasm apparent at most every one of her campaign stops make that evident -- but Klobuchar's assertive questioning of Warren on the debate stage clearly found a receptive audience.

""How is college going to be free? How is health care going to be free? How are we going to close down all private health insurance?"" said Susan Strodtbeck, a retired teacher who saw Klobuchar at a town hall meeting in Davenport. ""I'm sorry. We can't do that.""

When she asked Klobuchar about ""all that free stuff,"" the senator's face came alive as she joked that the only free offerings her campaign had were the chocolate chip cookies at the back of the room.

While Klobuchar has offered a pragmatic progressive message since she entered the race in February, the decision to sharpen her argument against Warren and Sanders, another top-tier candidate, is a strategic one. Time is running out for her to break out of the crowded field, with a little more than 100 days remaining until the Iowa caucuses kick off the voting early next year.

After sipping a cup of hot coffee, Klobuchar settled back into her seat on the bus, and explained why she believes that her rivals aren't leveling with voters.

""I'm not at all likening them to Donald Trump, who's plainly lying all the time,"" she said. ""But I'm saying that I think this calls for a time when we build trust with people, not by promising everything for free. I know that's appealing. I would love to have everything for free. You'd love to have everything for free, but I think people know that's not going to happen.""

She dismissed the possibility of backlash from liberal Democrats to her sharp criticism of Warren and Sanders. She defends her progressive voting record, while making clear that the party needs to appeal to a wider audience of Americans eager to see Trump replaced in the White House.

""There are independents and moderate Republicans -- maybe they didn't vote last time, but they're watching,"" Klobuchar said. ""So we better make sure that the message we're sending out there is one that brings them in as well.""

As she posed for pictures with voters at a brewery in Waterloo, Jerry Rasmussen stood and watched from a distance. He's a retired truck driver who said he's fed up with the Trump presidency and learned about Klobuchar from a friend in neighboring Minnesota.

""He's a Republican and says she does a great job for him up there, you know?"" Rasmussen said. ""I hope she can get stronger and pull ahead."""

Buttigieg campaign spokesperson Chris Meagher confirmed both Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan provided details on several names, two of which were eventually hired, in a statement to Bloomberg News.

Nina Wornhoff, now a data manager for the Buttigieg campaign, previously worked as a machine learning engineer at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the couple’s philanthropic arm. Eric Mayefsky, a digital analytics adviser for the Democrat presidential candidate, worked at Facebook between 2010-2014.

Newly confirmed details of Zuckerberg’s communication with the Buttigieg campaign is a “rare example of direct political involvement from one of tech’s most powerful executives,” Bloomberg’s Tyler Pager and Kurt Wagner write.

Of course, news of the emails is not the first time the two have crossed paths. In 2017, Zuckerberg and Buttigieg, both Harvard University alumni, hosted a Facebook Live discussion during the Facebook CEO’s Midwest listening tour. The South Bend mayor made headlines in May when he expressed support for additional regulations on Silicon Valley giants like Facebook, despite his relationship with Zuckerberg.

Bloomberg News’ report comes as a new poll released Monday shows that Buttigieg has risen to third place in the key primary state of Iowa.

The Suffolk University/USA TODAY poll states that former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) enjoy 18 percent and 17 percent approval from voters, while Buttigieg has garnered 13 percent. This boomlet comes after an obvious affectation of moderation during last week’s primary debate — reversing course after months of trashing Trump voters, particularly evangelicals, as morally bankrupt and hypocritical."

Host John Catsimatidis asked Morris if there are any candidates out there who have yet to announce a run that he could see running.

Morris said as long as Clinton has a “pulse,” there is a good chance she is going to run.

“I think it’s always possible that Hillary runs,” Morris stated. “You know, John, there’s a test you can do at home. Just put your fingers on her wrist, and if you feel a pulse, you know she’s going to run.”

Morris went on to say he believes Warren gets the nomination, which he explained would be bad news for the Democratic Party looking to take down President Donald Trump.

“I think Warren will still win. And I think Trump will still beat the daylights out of her, But this Democratic process isn’t over yet,” he advised.

said Monday that it is taking new steps to clearly identify state-run media for users and to better protect the accounts of political candidates and officials as part of a broader effort to prevent its platform from being abused to interfere with the 2020 US elections.

Starting next month, Facebook will label publications that are ""wholly or partially under the editorial control of their government as state-controlled media,"" the company said in a blog post Monday. These Facebook pages will be held to ""a higher standard of transparency because they combine the opinion-making influence of a media organization with the strategic backing of a state.""

Last year, YouTube added labels to videos that are posted by state-funded media outlets, linking to the broadcaster's Wikipedia page. But outlets like the BBC, a publicly funded broadcaster independent from the government, get a different label than an outlet like Russia Today.

""We expect Facebook's efforts to label content in this manner to be about as apt as its blocking of RT's pages containing Borscht recipes last week,"" RT spokesperson Anna Belkina told CNN Business. ""We will likely see the same labeling shenanigans as we did from Google, for whom some publicly funded outlets were more ""state funded"" than others, facts notwithstanding.""

Even as it takes steps to protect the next election, Facebook continues to grapple with bad actors from the last US presidential election. The company announced Monday that it removed 50 Instagram accounts and one Facebook account, some of which posed as locals from US swing states. Facebook says the accounts ""showed some links"" to the Internet Research Agency, a troll group with links to the Kremlin and a focus of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.

On a conference call with reporters Monday, Zuckerberg said the company's ability to proactively catch and disclose these coordinated networks of accounts shows that Facebook's defensive systems are working. He also stressed that Facebook now has more than 35,000 people working on safety and security efforts.

The policy updates and account takedowns come as Facebook and Zuckerberg confront continued scrutiny from politicians on Capitol Hill and on the campaign trail. Democratic presidential candidates including Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden have leveled sharp criticisms against the company in recent days for its policy of exempting ads by politicians from third-party fact-checking. The criticism followed the company's decision to allow a video ad from President Donald Trump's reelection campaign that falsely accused Biden of corruption for his role in Ukraine policy during the Obama administration.

When pressed about the policy again on the call, Zuckerberg stressed that other tech and media companies also ran the ad. ""I know that Facebook has been at the center of a lot of these debates,"" he said. But, he added, it's ""really not a policy area where we are an outlier."" (Broadcast networks and stations are required by law to run the ad; CNN, which is not subject to the same laws and regulations because it is a cable network, has opted not to air it.)

Zuckerberg once again framed his company's stance on political advertising -- and its decision not to do away with it on the platform entirely, despite its minimal contribution to Facebook's bottom line -- as a matter of giving people a ""voice.""

""This isn't about money,"" he said. ""Ads are an important way to get your message out and in front of people... Banning ads would favor incumbents and whoever the media would cover most."" At another point on the call, however, Zuckerberg conceded that incumbents ""can raise more money"" than their challengers to pay for more ads on Facebook and other platforms.

Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify before Congress on Wednesday in a hearing that is expected to focus on Facebook's plans for a digital currency. At least some of the scrutiny over Facebook's crypto plans could give the company even more power, at a time when its size and influence are already under investigation at the federal level.

In the face of that scrutiny, Zuckerberg has engaged in what appears to be a public relations campaign to put himself out there more. He gave a speech at Georgetown University last week describing politicians' calls to clamp down on tech companies as an effort to restrict the freedom of expression, followed by interviews with several major media outlets.

""I get that a lot of people are angry at us,"" Zuckerberg said in an interview with NBC Nightly News' Lester Holt that is set to air Monday night. ""Part of growing up for me has just been realizing that it is more important to be understood than it is to be liked, and I believe it very strongly.""

It's unclear how much Monday's announcements, or Zuckerberg's PR campaign, will do to make politicians like Facebook again."

The analysis finds 66 percent of millennials actually have no student debt, “either because they did not attend college or did not acquire debt in the process,” says the report by Beth Akers, Manhattan Institute senior fellow.

The student debt crisis is overblown: most millennials are not drowning in student debt. 66% of millennials have no student debt at all. And those who do have debt tend to have modest burdens relative to their income. https://t.co/MHkgJ3Qzip via @BethAkers_ — Manhattan Institute (@ManhattanInst) October 16, 2019

“The typical graduate will have borrowed $28,500 in pursuit of a bachelor’s degree,” the report continues. “That can be repaid with monthly payments of $181 on a standard, 20-year repayment plan.”

Secondly, only 6 percent of student borrowers have more than $100,000 in debt. Most of these borrowers have graduate or professional degrees and often come from families with higher income.

“More than one-third of outstanding student debt is held by individuals who are themselves in the highest income quartile,” with individual income greater than $97,000, the report observes. “Typically, those in trouble are not the ones with high debt but those who never completed college – default rates are highest for those with less than $5,000 in debt.”

Thirdly, the report notes the mean income for all millennials – including those without college degrees – is $46,092:

Under the existing income-driven repayment programs for all federal student loans … borrowers with this level of income would never be required to pay more than $173 per month (4.5% of pretax income), regardless of how much they had borrowed.

“The typical millennial has no student debt,” Akers writes. “Even among those who pursued higher education and borrowed to fund it, a typical household with two college-educated workers has more than $100,000 in annual income and pays less than $400 monthly on their loans.”

Instead of loan forgiveness, Akers recommends that federal intervention “focus on the small subset of borrowers with unmanageable debt burdens and ensure that they still repay what they can afford. Those programs already exist.”

The report is released as Democrats plan to reauthorize the Higher Education Act with provisions that would allow for massive “stealth” student loan forgiveness, as Preston Cooper wrote at Forbes.

Continuing along the path of the Obama administration, which ultimately allowed more student loans to be “forgiven,” the Democrats’ plan contains a proposal that changes how loan payments for student borrowers are calculated based on income. Cooper observes:

Currently, borrowers in these plans pay an amount equal to 10% of their income above 150% of the poverty line (about $25,000 for a household of two). House Democrats would raise that threshold to 250% of the poverty line, slashing monthly payments for some borrowers and eliminating them for others.

As it stands now, student debt after 20 years of repayment is “forgiven.” Raising the threshold of the poverty line, however, means American taxpayers will be stuck with billions in student loan “forgiveness.”

In October 2018, Jason Delisle and Cody Christensen wrote at National Review the Democrats’ plan “would let borrowers out of loans they could afford to pay back.”

They explain that a typical student borrower has an income of about $35,000 and, currently, would pay $140 per month in loan repayment, with “forgiveness” after 20 years of repayment. An increase in the income exemption to 250 percent of the poverty line, however, “means the borrower’s initial payments would be just $39.”

While payments would grow as the borrower’s income increases, under the Democrats’ plan payments “would still be so low that they would barely cover the interest on the $30,000 loan,” the authors noted. “That would mean all of the original principal balance would have to be forgiven after 20 years of payments.”

Many Democrat presidential hopefuls claim college graduates are crushed by student debt that prevents them from getting ahead and stimulating the economy.

Both 2020 candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have plans to cancel student debt.

Sanders’ proposal would eliminate all existing student loan debt in the country. His campaign website states, if elected, he will “cancel the entire $1.6 trillion in outstanding student debt for the 45 million borrowers who are weighed down by the crushing burden of student debt.”

Elizabeth Warren’s plan contains caps, but would still cancel $1.25 trillion in student debt for 42 million people. Her proposal would forgive $50,000 in student loan debt for every person with a household income of $100,000. Those whose households make between $100,000 and $250,000 would have a portion of their student debt forgiven.

In August, the Wall Street Journal editorial board minced no words in asserting American taxpayers are victims of a student loan “scam.” The board noted the New York Federal Reserve’s quarterly household debt survey released the week before showed more Americans are defaulting on their student loans.

The editors observed delinquent student loans have risen dramatically since 2012, when Barack Obama was president, and have overtaken delinquencies in credit card payments, auto loans, and mortgages.

During the Obama era, they noted, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) “scored student loans as a government profit center by underestimating the growth in income-based repayment plans.”

Now, however, CBO predicts taxpayers will be on the hook for $306.7 billion over the next ten years.

Of course, with the influx of taxpayer funds to pick up the tab, the WSJ board points out income-based repayment plans “have also encouraged schools to raise prices and enroll students who probably won’t earn enough to pay off their loans,” knowing those students ultimately will be “forgiven” by taxpayers.

As it happens, “Americans who borrow more than they can repay typically default first on student loans,” the editors say. But, while defaults on mortgages and car loans have serious consequences, individuals who default on student loans “are encouraged to enroll in income-based repayment plans.”

The editorial board warns of substantial losses for American taxpayers due to the Obama-era repayment scheme that current Democrats plan to take to new heights.

“All of this is worth keeping in mind as Democrats promise to save taxpayers billions by taking over other private industries and expanding the cradle-to-grave entitlement state,” the board says."

And they're here to meddle with 2020,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/21/tech/russia-instagram-accounts-2020-election/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) People linked to the Internet Research Agency, the Kremlin-backed troll group indicted by the United States for its alleged interference in the 2016 US presidential election , are laying the groundwork to do the same in 2020, new information released by Facebook on Monday suggests.

Profiles originating in Russia had since the beginning of this year been building a network of accounts on Instagram designed to look like groups in swing states, the company said . Instagram is owned by

Although the accounts posed as Americans from all sides of the political spectrum, many were united in their opposition to the candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden, according to Graphika , a social media investigations company that Facebook asked to analyze the accounts. The Russian trolls who used social media to interfere in the 2016 election employed a similar tactic , going after Hillary Clinton from the right and also trying to spread a perception on the left that Clinton was not liberal enough and that liberals and African Americans especially shouldn't bother voting for her.

The accounts Facebook revealed Monday, 50 of which were on Instagram and one of which was on Facebook, were designed to look like they were advocating on a broad range of issues across American life.

Accounts with usernames like @black.queen.chloe and @michigan_black_community_ looked like they were run by black activists. There were also pro and anti-Trump accounts, and accounts posing as feminists, LGBTQ rights advocates, and environmentalists. Other account names included @stop.trump2020, @bernie.2020__, @iowa.patriot, and @feminist_agenda_, according to Graphika.

Facebook said the accounts combined had more than 250,000 followers, more than half of which were based in the U.S. Facebook did not disclose how many of those followers were real and how many might have been fake or bot accounts designed to make the main accounts look more legitimate. Facebook says it has removed the accounts.

""It looked like there was a systematic focus on attacking Biden from both sides,"" Graphika director of investigations Ben Nimmo, who analyzed the accounts, told CNN Business.

In a statement responding to the news, Biden campaign spokesman TJ Ducklo said, ""We applaud Facebook for disclosing the existence of these fake accounts and shutting them down. ... [But] Donald Trump continues to benefit from spreading false information, all the while Facebook profits from amplifying his lies and debunked conspiracy theories on their platform. If Facebook is truly committed to protecting the integrity of our elections, they would immediately take down Trump's ads that attempt to gaslight the American people.""

Nimmo also observed attacks on other candidates, including Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, but said those attacks seemed more the result of ""character building"" in which the accounts were sharing content to bolster their respective personas -- for instance, liberal-looking accounts attacked Trump, while conservative-looking accounts posted negative content about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

""Among the accounts focused on black activism, there was strong support for Bernie Sanders along with a moderate amount of content opposing Kamala Harris,"" Graphika said in its analysis. ""Education reform and student debt relief were two of the most commonly mentioned reasons for supporting Sanders, while Harris's record as a California DA was mentioned as a reason to oppose her candidacy. Mixed in with these was a small amount of content attacking Joe Biden, primarily due to gaffes related to his previous handling of racial issues.""

Nimmo said the accounts sent just under 75,000 posts, the majority of which were not directly related to the 2020 election, but to broader political and social issues in the US.

Facebook said Monday those behind the operation had taken steps to conceal their identities and locations. The company did not publicly say how it had determined the accounts were linked to the Internet Research Agency but said it had shared details with law enforcement.

The campaign mostly recycled existing memes and posts from real American news organizations and political groups.

""This wasn't Russians targeting Americans with Russian content, this was Russians targeting Americans with American content,"" Nimmo said.

The decision to recycle existing content, rather than create new material, might have been part of the campaign's strategy to conceal its Russian links, Nimmo said. However, errors in some of the accounts' posts suggested the accounts weren't run by native English speakers.

""What the future for their children will be?"" the caption read on one post apparently criticizing Americans who don't remember the Confederacy fondly. Another account posted ""What a bullsh**.""

Nathaniel Gleicher, who leads Facebook's team investigating foreign influence operations, said the company had caught the operation in its early stages and that the Russian group had been focusing on audience building. Gleicher said the accounts were ""trying to make themselves look like ordinary citizens"" in a way that could later have lent credibility to their posts.

Facebook has taken extensive steps to crack down on foreign disinformation on its platforms since the 2016 election, including hiring former intelligence officials to root out campaigns like those run from Russia. Gleicher said that the steps Facebook had taken appeared to make it difficult for the Russian accounts ""to build the following among authentic communities.""

""People in Russia are still trying this,"" Nimmo told CNN Business on Monday. But, he said, they are finding it a lot harder because the social media companies ""are hunting them.""

""In 2016, you could have set up an account posing as a Tennessee Republican and have it registered to a Russian phone number,"" he noted.

Facebook also announced Monday that it had removed several networks of Iranian accounts, some of which targeted Americans. One of the accounts directed audiences to content about Black Lives Matter -- a tactic that was very popular among the Russian trolls in 2016 . The network had a relatively small following of more than 7,000 accounts.

While most of the focus on online foreign interference in the US has been devoted to Russia, over the past 12 months, Facebook has detected multiple Iranian campaigns targeting the United States."

It might drag on even longer if strikers reject a tentative agreement reached last week between the company and negotiators for the United Auto Workers union.,2019-10-21,CNN,"End of GM strike still uncertain, despite tentative labor deal",https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/21/business/gm-strike-uaw-vote/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) The strike at General Motors has already gone on for five weeks. It might drag on even longer if strikers reject a tentative agreement reached last week between the company and negotiators for the United Auto Workers union.

The negotiating team and union leadership are both recommending that the nearly 50,000 strikers vote to ratify the new four-year agreement. Results of the vote will be released Friday evening.

But there's a lot of anger towards GM among rank-and-file workers. The tentative deal reached last week would pay members an $11,000 signing bonus and raise hourly pay for veteran workers 6% over the life of the contract, to $32.32.

It also will allow many temporary workers to become permanent employees, which will significantly improve their pay and benefits. And the union got GM to drop its demand that workers pay a much greater percentage of their own health care costs.

But the UAW struck out in its efforts to have GM shutter some of its production in Mexico and relocate it to the United States to revive doomed plants here.

GM GM As part of the tentative agreement,agreed to save the Hamtramck assembly plant in Detroit. But the decision isn't related to Mexico. GM plans to use the plant to build electric trucks at an undetermined date more than a year away. Once production of sedans currently being built at Hamtramck ends in 2020, the plant will go dark for an extended period.

The union was unable to save three other plants - an assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio , and transmission plants in Warren, Michigan, and Baltimore, all which halted production earlier this year. And while thousands of workers at those plants have taken jobs at other GM plants, many are unhappy at having to relocate.

Tommy Wolikow used to work at GM's plant in Lordstown before relocating to work at a different GM plant in Flint, Michigan 250 miles away, leaving his family behind. He took the transfer hoping that this contract would force GM to shift more production from Mexico and reopen Lordstown. When he learned that wasn't included in tentative agreement, he said it was devastating.

""So many people left the community...with the thought in their mind that..our union is strong and our union's going to get us back to work in Lordstown one day, that this is just a brief thing that we got to do for our families,"" he said.

Without any production for Lordstown ""you know it's going to be a no vote for a lot of us,"" he said.

Tim O'Hara, president of the Lordstown union local, voted against the deal when it was presented to union leadership last week. Beyond the anger of Lordstown workers, he said strikers across the country are nervous about their jobs without an agreement from GM to bring work back from Mexico.

""You look on social media, you see a lot of people saying they don't like the terms,"" he said. ""It could go either way.""

Some of the workers are right to be nervous.

Two other GM assembly lines in Michigan are down to one shift per day, and could be at risk of closing during the four years of this proposed contract. Lordstown went from three shifts to a shutdown during the previous four-year deal. And despite the recent closings, GM's US plants still have excess capacity -- something that could be exacerbated if US sales continue to slow.

It was always unlikely that GM would agree to the union's demands that it shift production of any vehicles now being made in Mexico back to US plants, said Kristin Dziczek, the vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research.

""It cost billions of dollars to put them [in Mexico], and it'd cost billions of dollars to bring them back,"" said Dziczek. ""GM would have been loath to move anything back that they just spent money to put there.""

Only 55% of UAW members at GM approved the last deal , which was a much more positive contract for them: they received their first pay raises in more than a decade, and there were no plant closings or workers being relocated around the country.

It could be more difficult to complete the deal this time, given the anger directed at the company.

is its fear that the deal could be voted down. Four years ago, membership at Fiat Chrysler FCAU Ford F One reason the union may have postponed workers returning to workis its fear that the deal could be voted down. Four years ago, membership atrejected a tentative agreement, although they weren't on strike at the time. Membership atonly narrowly approved a deal that year as well.

If the GM strikers returned to work and then rejected a deal, it would be very hard for union negotiators to improve any terms at the bargaining table, said Dziczek.

""Once the strikers are back at work, [the negotiators] have no leverage,"" she said.

That members have been on strike since September 16 could cut both ways.

""The fact that they were out for five weeks, their expectations are higher,"" said Art Schwartz, a former GM labor negotiator who is now a consultant. ""But they want the ratification bonus. They have bills to pay. Both forces are at work.""

Schwartz wouldn't make a prediction on how this vote would go.

""It used to be a slam dunk,"" he said. ""But that seems to be changing."""

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) claimed a larger crowd for his rally in Queens on Saturday than Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) claimed last month for her rally in Manhattan, signaling that he is far from ready to cede the primary fight.

Sanders’s campaign estimated that 26,000 people attended his rally, where he was formally endorsed by left-wing icon Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Though an independent crowd estimate was not reported, a security firm that worked at the event counted 25,872 attendees, according to the Washington Examiner. The Examiner said the city had issued a permit for 15,000 people in the local park, but that about 10,000 people watched from outside.

In contrast, Warren’s campaign estimated that 20,000 people showed up for her rally in Washington Square Park in the heart of lower Manhattan in September, though the park itself only holds 10,000, the maximum permitted for the event. Warren’s campaign has a consistent habit of exaggerating its crowd sizes; Biden rarely draws large crowds.

Though Warren now leads in many national polls of Democratic party presidential primary voters, especially in the states that will vote first, Sanders is still clinging to his spot among the three frontrunners, together with former Vice President Joe Biden. He used the rally to send the message that he has recovered from a heart attack just two weeks before. At 78, he is the oldest candidate in the race — though both Biden and Warren are also in their seventies.

Warren has established herself as a fierce proponent of a single-payer health care system, but she has not gone as far as her ideological counterpart, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), in admitting that the plan will result in taxes going up for middle class Americans.

The presidential hopeful told a crowd at a town hall event in Indianola, Iowa, on Sunday that she will soon release an outline detailing the plan to fund the system, which by some estimates could cost over $60 trillion in the next decade.

“We need to talk about the cost, and I plan, over the next few weeks, to put out a plan that talks about specifically the cost of ‘Medicare for All’ and specifically how we pay for it,” Warren told the crowd.

“I think there have been many estimates about what the cost will be, and many different payment streams, and I’ve been working on how to give the exact details to make that work,” she told reporters:

Warren adviser on Friday: ""[Warren’s] taxes as they currently exist are NOT enough yet to cover fully replacing health insurance.” Warren today: ""I've been working for a long time on this question about what the cost will be and how to pay for it."" pic.twitter.com/quq7e0GjVF — Steve Guest (@SteveGuest) October 20, 2019

Moderators – in more than one Democrat debate – have asked Warren if she would raise taxes on the middle class in order to pay for Medicare for All. Each time, the Massachusetts senator has offered notoriously evasive responses, talking about overall “cost” rather than directly explaining if taxes will go up for the middle class.

Moderators presented her with the same question during last week’s Democrat debate, and Warren went to her go-to talking point, arguing that overcall costs will go up for the “wealthy and big corporations” and go down for middle-class families.

That answer sparked criticism from Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who slammed Warren for repeatedly dodging the question.

“Well, you heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer,” he said.

“Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular,” he continued. “Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this.”

Warren would not budge in the spin room following the debate, telling the panel, “My commitment is I will not sign a bill into law that raises costs on middle class families.”

Sanders, on the other hand, has been very open about the cost of his plan. While he also believes that it is about overall “costs,” – arguing that middle class Americans will ultimately save money due to health care costs supposedly going down – he admitted last month that health care is not free.

“Now having said that, is health care free? No, it is not,” Sanders told late-night host Stephen Colbert last month. “So what we do is exempt the first $29,000 of a person’s income. You make less than $29,000, you pay nothing in taxes.”

“Above that, in a progressive way with the wealthiest people paying the largest percentage, people do pay more in taxes,” he continued. “But if I say to you, that right now you’re paying $20,000 a year in a tax called a premium for insurance companies. That’s gone.”"

Rand Paul (R-KY) called rising support for socialism among youth in America “mind-boggling,” in a recent exclusive interview with Breitbart News on his new book The Case Against Socialism.

Paul, a 2016 Republican presidential candidate and prominent libertarian, said he remembers in the 1970s and 1980s when Americans would never admit to being socialists, let alone a liberal. Today, he said, Democrats are openly running on socialist platforms, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).

“It’s kind of mind-boggling, actually,” he said in an interview on Wednesday. “We now live in a time where not only are people talking about socialism, they’re proudly running as a socialist.”

“I think it’s important for this generation to realize what socialism was in the last century and how [it] really invariably was associated with violence, with genocide, with famine, with horrible tragedy and you know, today’s youth seems to have forgotten that,” he said.

He said in China, as many as 40 million died during the Great Famine in the late 1950s, and today, in Venezuela, people are eating their pets.

“That is the end result of socialism, there is no food in the stores,” he said. “Venezuela has more oil than any other country in the world, they have more oil than Saudi Arabia, they were one of the richest countries, and now they’re in calamitous poverty.”

His book tells the story of a young woman in Venezuela in a gang that controls territory — six dumpsters where they can search for food.

“How did they get there? It’s almost, it’s mind-boggling. How do you even explain it?” he said.

He said he does not think America is ready for socialism, but pointed out that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) — who does not call herself a socialist but is running on socialist policies — appears to be the Democrat frontrunner.

“The socialist doesn’t win, but the person who has all the same policies who doesn’t call herself a socialist, Elizabeth Warren, and right now is looking like the frontrunner, but she’s for most of the policies that Bernie Sanders is for and so that will be the question, will we elect someone with socialist policies?” he said.

Paul debunked the myth that there is socialism in Scandinavia.

“They’re not socialist in Scandinavia. They have private property, they have a private stock market, they don’t even have a minimum wage, prices go up and down, but they do have a big welfare state. So while they’re not socialist they have a big welfare state. They do have free college, free paid leave, all these sort of welfare goodies,” he said.

“It turns out in Scandinavia, the way they pay for free college and all this so-called free stuff is they tax the working class, and the middle class, extensively, so there’s a 25 percent sales tax, they call it a VAT, it’s on food, clothing, everything, you name it. Twenty-five percent so everybody pays that, including the poor. So that’s a pretty significant tax — 25 percent,” he said.

“They also have an income tax that’s 60 percent starting at $60,000. That’s way higher than the United States. So the dirty little secret of Scandinavia is you can have a welfare state but everybody’s got to pay taxes,” he said.

He said back in the U.S., Warren is promising Medicare-for-all without saying whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it.

“She won’t answer the question. Now Bernie has, he said we’ll raise taxes on the middle class but they’ll save money on their healthcare cause it’ll be ‘free,'” he said.

“Well Elizabeth Warren won’t answer that question, I think that’s going to be an important question for her, and we’ll see, and even the left and the establishment media and the left are going, ‘Elizabeth, how are you going to pay for this?’ and I think she’s boxed in a corner and eventually she’s going to have to admit — with massive middle class taxes.”

The new poll by Iowa Emerson College showed that only six percent of registered voters in Iowa said impeachment was their top issue. In comparison, 33 percent said the economy was the top issue, 19 percent said health care, and ten percent said social issues.

Even among just Democrats, 25 percent said health care was the most important issue, 17 percent said the economy, and 14 percent said the environment. Among Republicans, 55 percent said the economy was the most important issue, 14 percent said immigration. Among independents, 27 percent said the economy was the most important issue and 24 percent said health care.

In other words — impeachment is not within the top issues that Iowa voters care about. The Iowa poll also found a plurality of voters — 48 percent — oppose impeachment, versus 42 percent who support impeachment.

However, last week, three Democrat-led House committees held three separate closed-door hearings with current and former U.S. and State Department officials as part of House Democrats’ efforts to impeach Trump. And the fourth Democrat debate on Wednesday began with the issue of impeachment.

“The Democrats have some work to do in Iowa convincing voters that impeachment is a top priority of Congress; 67% of Democrats in Iowa support impeaching the president, but only 10% identify it as the most important issue in deciding their vote for president,” said Spencer Kimball, director of Emerson Polling.

A recent Axios focus group showed that nine out of 11 swing voters in Ohio said impeachment is a distraction from the issues they care most about, which are wages and unemployment, border security, bringing troops home, and health care costs and access.

With all but less than a dozen House Democrats supporting impeachment or an impeachment inquiry, it is considered increasingly inevitable. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has told Republican senators that he expects House Democrats will seek to impeach Trump. He has vowed in a campaign video he will stop it in the Senate.

The poll also showed that in a head-to-head matchup, Trump has a slight advantage over Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and former Vice President Joe Biden, 51 percent to 49 percent. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has a two-point advantage over Trump, 51 percent to 49 percent.

Among the Democrat candidates, Warren and Biden are tied at 23 percent, with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 16 percent, and Sanders fourth at 13 percent.

The Iowa poll was conducted October 13-16, 2019, with a sample size of 888 registered voters. The margin of error was +/- 3.2 percentage points.

Then, on Friday, Hillary Clinton herself kept the smear campaign going, saying in a podcast hosted by Barack Obama’s former campaign manager David Plouffe that Russia is grooming Gabbard to be a third party candidate.

“I’m not making any predictions, but I think they’ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,” Clinton said. “She’s the favorite of the Russians.”

Gabbard lashed back at the Democratic Party’s 2016 presidential nominee, tweeting in response, “Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain.”

Days before Gabbard appeared on the debate stage in Ohio, she had threatened to boycott the event, because she believes the DNC is rigged against outsider candidates such as herself. She declared that the Democratic National Committee and the “corporate media” were “trying to hijack the entire election process.”

Among other reasons, Gabbard argued that the polls the DNC chose for certifying the candidates for the November debate were not as accurate as many of the non-certified polls that could actually help her qualify. So far, the only candidates who have qualified for November are former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

But the media smears, and the evident bias of the debate hosts, were the driving force.

Two days after Gabbard’s threat, the New York Times published what she called “ a greatest hits smear piece.” Gabbard later noted: “These are the folks who will be acting as the neutral questioners/moderators of Tuesday’s debate lol!”

At the debate itself, Gabbard took aim at the hosts: “Just two days ago the New York Times put out an article saying that I’m a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning a CNN commentator said on national television that I’m an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.”

It was actually very kind of Gabbard to not mention the name attached to the CNN smear. Bakari Sellers said hours before the event that he firmly believed that Tulsi is a ‘puppet for the Russian government.”

The fact is that Gabbard, a reservist in the U.S. Army National Guard who took time off her campaign to drill with her unit this summer, is more cautious about the use of military force than other candidates. For that, she is being attacked as a traitor.

But it is a stance that has appeal to members of both parties who are weary of interventionist foreign policies.

Another political outsider, former Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX), is a Tulsi Gabbard fan. Paul praised Gabbard when he said, “She’s the most intelligent and would be the best. “ He also said, “If we had to pick one of them [Democrats] to be our president I think she would be giving us the best chance as for bringing about peace.”

Gabbard is a proud veteran who founded and is the co-chair of the Congressional Post 9/11 Veteran Caucus, which demonstrates her continual work in defending the work her military brothers and sisters continue to do to fight for their country.

At the debate, when Gabbard calmly asked if she could ask Warren a question, she was cut off. Silenced by the very media who smeared her, as if to protect Warren.

Yet Gabbard, as after the second debate, was the most googled candidate after the candidates left the stage.

Apparently American want to hear more from Tulsi despite the smears. The Times called Gabbard’s supporters “unusual Americans”; that has now become a rallying cry.

These “Unusual Amerians” include the ”unconventional mix of anti-interventionist progressives, libertarians, [and] contrarian culture-war skeptics…” that the Times mocked as Gabbard’s base by associating them with extremists.

Gabbard delivered a powerful response in her closing statement at the debate: “I don’t see deplorables. I see fellow Americans worthy of respect even when we disagree strongly.”

Gabbard’s use of the word “deplorables” was a clear allusion Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables,” a phrase that the former secretary of state used to tarnish her opponent’s supporters back in 2016. It came back to haunt Clinton — as will her declaration that Gabbard is Russia’s favorite.

Gabbard, unlike Clinton and many of the presidential hopefuls in 2020, has sacrificed for her country through her military service in a combat zone, and understands the cost of war from first-hand experience.

That is the simple secret of her appeal. It is amazing how far the corporate media and the party establishment will go in their attempt to stop that message from breaking through.

The mayor’s mention of President Trump prompted many Sanders supporters to chant “Lock Him Up” — a play on the “Lock Her Up” slogan synonymous with failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

“You know what? Let’s vote him out,” Cruz responded to attendees, before leading a “Vote Him Out” chant.

Cruz has repeatedly criticized President Trump’s response to Hurricane Maria, which killed 3,057 people across the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico in September 2017. Yet, it is Cruz and other members of her administration that are under investigation by the FBI for allegedly keeping supplies from reaching the victims.

The “Bernie’s Back “rally marked the Sanders campaign’s first rally since the 78-year-old suffered a heart attack two weeks ago.

Storming past questions about his health, Sanders vowed that he’s “more ready than ever” to fight for a political revolution — with a little help from new friends — at his rally that drew thousands to a New York City park. The rally offered a pointed reminder to skeptics in both political parties that the democratic socialist is still very much a force in the presidential race.

Sanders opened his remarks by apologizing that he secured a permit for only 20,000 people. His campaign, he said, was forced to close the gates on many more people who were trying to enter the Queens park just across the river from Manhattan.

“To put it bluntly, I am back,” Sanders declared, sparking chants of, “Bernie is back” from the massive crowd.

“I am happy to report to you that I am more than ready — more ready than ever — to carry on with you on the epic struggle that we face today,” he added. “I am more than ready to assume the office of president of the United States.”

The event marked Sanders’ formal return to the campaign trail less than three weeks after he suffered a heart attack that threatened both his life and political future. Even before that, he was in danger of falling out of the top-tier in the 2020 Democratic primary field. Polls suggest he’s lagging behind liberal rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and establishment favorite former Vice President Joe Biden.

The Virginia State Police Bureau of Criminal Investigation’s Culpeper office charged Strasburg Mayor Richard Orndorff Jr. on Thursday with four misdemeanor counts of food stamp fraud and two misdemeanor counts of obtaining money by false pretense, WHSV reported.

Police say they began their investigation into Orndorff on March 15, 2019, to look into allegations that Orndorff misused town funds and a state-issued debit card.

The mayor, who has not said whether he is resigning from his position, turned himself into the Rappahannock Shenandoah Warren Regional Jail on Thursday where he was processed and later released, the Northern Virginia Daily reported.

Virginia state police say they are continuing to investigate Orndorff even after the indictment.

The fraud case follows an incident where Orndorff was charged with DUI after he allegedly crashed into the Strasburg Community Library with a John Deere Gator ATV.

Orndorff is scheduled to appear in Shenandoah County General District Court on November 19 for that incident.

Residents of Strasburg circulated a petition calling for Orndorff’s resignation back when he was charged with DUI, with the petition gaining 113 signatures."

(CNN) As the Republic of Venice slowly slid into the 18th century, its economic power was waning while military threats piled up all around it. Inside the city, though, it maintained a vibrant cultural and political life.

When its elites, visiting nobility, and the lower status citizens of the city wanted to mingle, they all would put on masks. Far from the elaborate contraptions sold on every corner in the touristy city, mostly these masks didn't do much to conceal identity. Instead, they provided a polite fiction that allowed people to cross social lines without threatening social norms. Early modern Venetians had masks; today, politicians have Twitter.

Last week, Sen. Mitt Romney told The Atlantic writer McKay Coppins that he had a secret Twitter account , offering just enough details that Ashley Feinberg, who writes for Slate, could deduce its identity . Feinberg reasoned that Romney would want to follow his family members, including his grandchildren, some of whom have relatively few followers. Feinberg introduced us to Twitter user @qaws9876 , aka Pierre Delecto. When Coppins confronted Romney with the deduction, the senator replied only, ""C'est moi"" (or ""it's me,"" in French).

The revelations about Romney's activity on Twitter come at a curious time for the ""sometimes Trump"" Republican caucus, whose ranks include Romney. These Republicans, who include both lawmakers and writers , took principled positions against the president when he was running for the GOP nomination, mostly backed him against Clinton or suggested they might futilely write-in another option.

Since Trump's election, they have oscillated back and forth from quiescent subjugation to periodic public complaint about presidential conduct. These complaints never seem to result in Republicans organizing against Trump from within. Only rarely has this cohort voted against Trump's norms in Congress ( with a few notable exceptions ) and never have they publicly campaigned for Democrats. In fact, as Elizabeth Warren seems to have emerged as at least a co-frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, most ""Sometimes Trump"" writers seem to be setting themselves up to reluctantly support the president

But now with Trump and his cronies — both staff like Mick Mulvaney and on-again off-again personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani — almost daily confessing to transgressions, it's both easier for Republicans like Romney to stand against the president and harder for him to stay quiet.

Twitter is a performative space, at least if you have a public account. Whereas Facebook has sophisticated layering of privacy options — often bewildering to the casual user — that encourage participation within closed, selected, networks of mutual connections, Twitter promotes the short, loud blast. It's a place that works very well for sharing news and for making like-minded connections. Its public nature also comes with the serious risk of harassment and bullying.

His mask had come off, but he hadn't used this private account to do anything especially significant. Pierre Delecto only tweeted 10 times. Feinberg noted that a number of responses were aimed at journalists directly criticizing Romney and other Republicans for a lack of spine in the face of Trump's flagrant misconduct. Wait and see, Romney seemed to suggest, but there's nothing revelatory here. We've been waiting to see for a long time.

I'm a historian of pre-modern Venice and often think about the efforts that medieval democracy undertook to maintain social order, protect their electoral systems, and thrive in a fraught space between different spheres of power (Rome, the Holy Roman Empire, Byzantium and then the Ottomans, Catholics versus Protestants, and more over the centuries).

Their masks have enhanced a reputation for secrecy and debauchery, that ""anything goes"" once the masks are on. In the recent book, ""Venice Incognito,"" though, historian James Johnson argues that masks were in many cases a tool of the status quo, ""permitting contact among unequals through fictive concealment. Rather than obscuring identities, masks affirmed their permanence."" The donning of a mask created a fiction that affirmed social structures, rather than threatening them.

Mitt Romney and a handful of other Republican leaders have a chance to act. But they are going to have do so without masks and, most critically, they are going to have to risk upsetting their own delicate position. Romney and the rest will have to stop performing principled resistance and actually resist. Trump will eventually be gone, but for America to move past this difficult moment, all the masks must come off."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Monday unveiled her public education proposal, which includes halting the “privatization” of public schools, stopping vouchers, enhancing protections for illegal immigrant students, and quadrupling Title I funding.

While there are many facets to Warren’s plan, she devotes a significant section to combating the “privatization” of public schools. It is necessary, Warren says, to “resist efforts to divert public funds out of traditional public schools.” She continued:

To keep our traditional public school systems strong, we must resist efforts to divert public funds out of traditional public schools. Efforts to expand the footprint of charter schools, often without even ensuring that charters are subject to the same transparency requirements and safeguards as traditional public schools, strain the resources of school districts and leave students behind, primarily students of color.

Because of that, Warren is calling for the end of vouchers, tuition tax credits, and federally-funded expansions of charter schools. She also calls for a full ban of for-profit charter schools.

“We should stop the diversion of public dollars from traditional public schools through vouchers or tuition tax credits – which are vouchers by another name,” she wrote.

“We should fight back against the privatization, corporatization, and profiteering in our nation’s schools,” she added.

That stands in contrast with the position Warren took in the past, particularly ahead of her 2012 senatorial campaign. She actually championed vouchers and assessed that they “take pressure off parents” in terms of having to purchase homes in neighborhoods zoned for desirable schools. She added that vouchers encourage competition and produce results, creating something “parents can buy into and believe in.”

Warren also painted a dire picture of a public education system, where both segregation and discrimination are, she believes, running rampant.

“But broad public affirmation of the Brown v. Board of Education decisions in the 1950s and recent debates about historical desegregation policies have obscured an uncomfortable truth – our public schools are more segregated today than they were about thirty years ago,” Warren claimed, weaving in her “Housing Plan for America” as a viable solution for these issues and ignoring her past calls for vouchers, which 2011 Warren suggested would help remedy the disparity.

Additionally, the presidential hopeful’s plan enhances protections for illegal immigrant students, calling the Trump administration’s immigration policies “inhumane” and attributing them to the increase of fear among illegal immigrant families. She said:

Immigration makes America stronger – economically, socially, and culturally. But because of the Trump Administration’s inhumane immigration policies, many immigrant students are afraid to go to school, and many families living in the shadows are afraid to access resources like free school lunch. I would end the Trump’s Administration’s monstrous policies and enact immigration reform that is fair, humane, and reflects our values. I will ensure immigrant students don’t get second-class status by being directed into GED programs instead of classrooms. I will protect sensitive locations like schools from immigrant enforcement actions. And I’ll recommit OCR to upholding and enforcing Plyler v. Doe – which the Trump administration has tried to undermine – so that all immigrant children have access to a quality education, no matter their native language, national origin, immigration status, or educational history.

She also promises to affirm the rights of LGBT students by reinstating the “guidance revoked under Trump about transgender students’ rights under Title IX, and make clear that federal civil rights law prohibits anti-LGBTQ+ rules like discriminatory dress codes, prohibiting students from writing or discussing LGBTQ+ topics in class, or punishing students for bringing same-sex partners to school events.”

In another section, Warren pledges to push a guidance that would “limit the use of discriminatory dress codes targeting student dress and hairstyle,” which she says leads to “students of color losing valuable learning time and Muslim students being denied participation in school activities.”

Warren’s plan also proposes the cancelation of student breakfast and lunch debt, as well as free school meals and free universal pre-K, which she has said she would pay for via her “wealth tax.”

“It’s time to live up to the promise of a high-quality public education for every student,” Warren wrote. “My plan makes big, structural changes that would help give every student the resources they need to thrive.”"

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) proposed to end school vouchers in her public education plan released Monday despite praising them in the past for helping “take the pressure off parents” and encouraging competition.

Warren released her extensive plan on the public education system in America on Monday, which offered a swath of pledges, from protecting illegal immigrant families to promising an additional $450 billion in Title I funding over the next decade.

One of the most significant aspects of the presidential hopeful’s proposal, however, is her call to end school vouchers. Warren argues that the voucher system leaves minority students behind and called to end federal funding for new charter schools.

Vouchers (or school choice), Warren asserts, hurt minorities and result in school segregation and discrimination. She harkened to her housing plan, which gives states funds to build desirable parks and schools “if they eliminate the kinds of restrictive zoning laws that can further racial segregation”

“And it includes a historic new down payment assistance program that promotes integration by giving residents of formerly redlined areas help to buy a home in any community they choose,” Warren says.

However, Warren’s pitch stands in stark contrast to the solution she offered in years past. During an interview with Fox Business in May 2011, Warren praised vouchers, essentially arguing that they helped solve the problem that she explicitly outlined in the plan released Monday.

She said that school vouchers alleviated pressure from parents and essentially fostered an environment of competition “that really produces results and parents can buy into and believe in.”

Warren said (emphasis added):

The point is, we have a private school system now, only the way it’s doled out is instead of paying tuition, you buy a house in a certain zip code and pay taxes and keep everyone locked out who’s not in that zip code. We call those public schools. But look at the financing for them. If every child in the state of Massachusetts — every child in this country — got a ticket, and the ticket was funded by taxpayers, because I believe in public education, but it could be used at any school regardless of what kind of house parents can afford to buy, it would first take the pressure off parents in terms of having to buy those houses, and second would mean that those schools now compete with each other for offering the kind of education that really produces results and parents can buy into and believe in.

Warren previewed that position years before in her 2003 book, The Two-Income Trap.

“But the public-versus-private competition misses the central point. The problem is not vouchers; the problem is parental choice,” Warren wrote — a line that stands in stark contrast to her current plan to take away parental choice by ending vouchers.

“Under current voucher schemes, children who do not use the vouchers are still assigned to public schools based on their zip codes. This means that in the overwhelming majority of cases, a bureaucrat picks the child’s school, not a parent,” she continued, as quoted by the Wall Street Journal.

Warren carried that position into her 2012 senatorial campaign, even publicly supporting charter schools.

“Warren holds some positions on education that challenge union orthodoxy. For instance, she favors charter schools and the use of student test scores as a factor in evaluating teachers, as long as teachers help craft the evaluations,” the Boston Globe reported in March 2012.

The presidential hopeful’s plan on Monday, though, laments the existence of vouchers and charter schools.

“We have a responsibility to provide great neighborhood schools for every student. We should stop the diversion of public dollars from traditional public schools through vouchers or tuition tax credits – which are vouchers by another name,” she wrote, adding that we must “fight back against the privatization, corporatization, and profiteering in our nation’s schools.”"

Elizabeth Warren's silence on how she plans to pay for Medicare for All has turned into a problem at an important moment in her campaign. Right as she has become one of the clear frontrunners in the Democratic race — if not the frontrunner — she walked out of the fourth Democratic debate a bit bruised from her unwillingness to answer the question about whether she would raise taxes to pay for the benefits.

Warren has promised to release her plan about paying for the benefits. ""Right now the cost estimates for Medicare for All vary by trillions and trillions of dollars and the different revenue stream for how to fund it, there are a lot of it,"" she said in Iowa . ""This is something I've been working on for months and months, and it's got just a little more work until it's finished.""

The plan will likely involve a package that mixes higher taxes and other revenue streams in exchange for eliminating the deductibles and premiums as well as other out-of-pocket expenses. Warren might make some adjustments to proposed benefits to lower the high estimates that are currently being projected.

But to take control of this debate, Warren needs to offer more than a policy brief about finance. She has the chance to turn this challenge into an opportunity to make this part of her signature issue — restoring security to middle class Americans. It's an issue that has gotten drowned out with all the emphasis on health care.

During the televised debates, the conversation about paying for Medicare for All has overwhelmed almost every other domestic issue. The good news for her and other proponents of this idea is that although polls show that 55% of Democrats would prefer to build on the existing Affordable Care Act, 51% of all Americans support a Medicare for All approach — a good sign of the potential to win votes across the aisle.

689,"Matt Egan, CNN Business",,Elizabeth Warren fears Wall Street will use the recent mayhem in overnight lending markets to convince Washington to relax regulations aimed at preventing a repeat of the 2008 crisis.,2019-10-22,CNN,Elizabeth Warren is alarmed about turmoil in overnight lending markets,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/22/business/elizabeth-warren-overnight-lending-regulation/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Elizabeth Warren fears Wall Street will use the recent mayhem in overnight lending markets to convince Washington to relax regulations aimed at preventing a repeat of the 2008 crisis.

Warren, the Democratic presidential candidate, wrote a letter on Friday to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin saying she is ""alarmed"" by last month's spike in overnight lending rates.

These rules were designed to ensure that banks have enough cash on hand to meet their obligations in the event of another market crash.""

The September cash crunch in a critical corner of finance forced the New York Federal Reserve to come to the rescue for the first time in a decade.

The precise cause of the market stress is unclear. However, bankers and some analysts have said that post-crisis rules may be at fault, because they limit the ability of banks to provide cash to short-term borrowers when it's needed.

Warren, a strong proponent of tough regulation on Wall Street, doesn't buy that argument.

""Banks are reporting profits at record levels,"" Warren wrote in a letter her office released on Tuesday, ""and it would be painfully ironic if unexplained chaos in a small corner of the banking market became an excuse to further loosen rules that protect the economy from these types of risks.""

For instance, big banks must comply with the liquidity coverage ratio, or LCR, which requires them to keep a large amount of easily tradeable assets on their balance sheets. The goal is to avoid a repeat of 2008, when banks were sitting on toxic mortgage assets they couldn't unload when they needed the cash.

Warren urged Mnuchin, who serves as chairman of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, to answer a series of questions by November 1 about the causes of the overnight market turmoil and what regulators are doing to prevent the disruption from impacting the real economy.

Emergency cash injections

The inquiry underscores the lingering mystery over the market stress more than a month after it first emerged. Although borrowing rates have tumbled back to normal levels, there are still signs of strain.

The overnight lending market plays a crucial role in modern finance. This market allows banks, hedge funds and other institutions to quickly and easily borrow money.

On September 17, the rate on overnight repurchase agreements, or repos, soared as high as 10%. That's well above the target range of about 2% for short-term borrowing set by the Federal Reserve. The episode suggested that the plumbing in the financial system was broken.

The NY Fed stepped in with a series of emergency cash injections aimed at easing the market stress. The rescues successfully drove rates back down.

Initially, the Fed pinned the blame on two one-off factors: The withdrawal of cash by US companies to make quarterly tax payments to the Treasury Department, and the settlement of a large amount of Treasury purchases. But both factors should have been anticipated by investors, and the market pressure continued even after those events subsided.

In fact, there was such strong demand for the NY Fed's repo operations that it suggested the central bank's continued support is needed. Banks and other financial institutions were still clamoring for cash.

Earlier this month, the Fed announced a new program aimed at easing the liquidity squeeze. The central bank said it will purchase up to $60 billion of Treasury bills per month. The move will boost the size of the Fed's balance sheet, reversing recent efforts to shrink it. The reversal suggests the Fed underestimated how much cash is needed to keep the system running smoothly.

The Fed stressed that unlike the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, this round of bond buying is not designed to boost sluggish economic growth. It's squarely focused on fixing the problem in the overnight lending market.

'We'd have been happy to'

Some analysts and industry officials argued that the overnight lending problems show the unintended consequences of post-crisis rules, such as the liquidity requirements.

Almost immediately, the Bank Policy Institute, a bank lobbying organization, wrote a blog post urging regulators to rethink liquidity requirements.

JPMorgan Chase JPM EvenCEO Jamie Dimon chimed in. During a conference call last week, Dimon said JPMorgan had the cash required to soothe the overnight lending markets -- but its hands were tied by regulations.

""We could not redeploy it into the repo market, which we'd have been happy to do,"" Dimon said. ""And I think it's up to the regulators to decide they want to recalibrate the kind of liquidity they expect us to keep.""

Philip Marey, senior US strategist at Rabobank, agrees that regulation is playing a role.""Due to post-crisis regulation, banks are no longer taking the risks necessary to keep the plumbing of the financial system open in times of stress,"" he wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.

Warren expressed concern that regulators ""might support"" efforts to dial back post-crisis regulations in response to the market turbulence.

""These rules were designed to ensure that banks have enough cash on hand to meet their obligations in the event of another market crash,"" she wrote.

$99.9 billion pumped in on Tuesday alone

No matter the cause, there are still clear signs of pressure in the short-term borrowing markets.

The NY Fed pumped in $99.9 billion of cash into the financial system on Tuesday alone. That included $64.9 billion of overnight repurchase agreements as well as a $35 billion operation that doesn't expire until November 5.

In addition to that short-term liquidity, the Fed injected $7.5 billion into the market through Treasury bill purchases. Banks tried to secure $41.5 billion of funding from the Fed, meaning the operation was five-and-a-half times oversubscribed. In other words, banks are still clamoring for cash.

And US fixed income strategists at JPMorgan are warning that the funding stress is likely to intensify towards the end of the year, when seasonal stress normally emerges.

""This is all likely to get much worse, in our view, before it gets better,"" the JPMorgan analysts wrote."

His press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, later tweeted , ""I hope we see honest reporting from today's mtg.""

We can honestly tell you that Trump's remarks were highly dishonest.

We're still looking into some of the President's claims. We can report that at least 21 of them were false:

Barack Obama and Kim Jong Un

""But in the meantime, North Korea, I like Kim, he likes me. We get along. I respect him, he respects me. 'You could end up in a war.' President Obama told me that. He said, 'The biggest problem, I don't know how to solve it.' He told me he doesn't know how to solve it. I said, 'Did you ever call him?' 'No.' Actually, he tried 11 times. But the man on the other side, the gentleman on the other side, did not take his call. OK? Lack of respect. But he takes my call,'"" Trump said.

Facts First: There is no apparent basis for the claim that Obama tried to call Kim Jong Un 11 times.

""This is a total fabrication. Trump is completely delusional, and it's scary,"" Susan Rice, who served as Obama's national security adviser, said on Twitter in response to our tweet of Trump's quote.

""We never called Kim,"" Ben Rhodes, who served as Obama's deputy national security adviser, told CNN.

Trump has previously claimed that Obama begged Kim for a meeting, another assertion for which there is no evidence.

The Iraq War

""If you remember, I didn't want to go into Iraq. I was a civilian, so I had no power over it. But I always was speaking against going into Iraq,"" Trump said.

Facts First: Trump did not publicly oppose the invasion of Iraq before it began. Trump was tentatively supportive of the war when radio host Howard Stern asked him in September 2002, ""Are you for invading Iraq?"" He : Trump did not publicly oppose the invasion of Iraq before it began. Trump was tentatively supportive of the war when radio host Howard Stern asked him in September 2002, ""Are you for invading Iraq?"" He responded : ""Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly."" The day after the invasion in March 2003, he said , ""It looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint."" Trump did not offer a definitive position on the looming war in a Fox News interview in January 2003, saying, ""Either you attack or don't attack.""

Trump started publicly questioning the war later in 2003, and he was an explicit opponent in an Esquire article published 17 months after the invasion. That is not the same as ""I was against going to the war.""

The presidential salary

""But I give away my presidential salary. They say that no other president has done it. I'm surprised, to be honest with you. They actually say that George Washington may have been the only other president,"" Trump said.

Facts First: Trump does : Trump does donate his salary, but the rest of his claim was inaccurate. He is not the only president to have donated the official salary; both John F. Kennedy and Herbert Hoover did so. Washington did not.

Although Washington initially declined his salary, he relented after Congress insisted.

George Washington's ""two desks""

Trump said ""George Washington, he ran his business simultaneously"" as he was president, adding, ""George Washington, they say, had two desks. He had a presidential desk and a business desk."" He gestured as if pointing to two desks sitting side by side.

Facts First: Washington, a major landowner, did continue to own property while serving as president, and he took an Washington, a major landowner, did continue to own property while serving as president, and he took an interest in his farm at Mount Vernon while in office -- even writing to a United Kingdom official to discuss getting help finding renters for Mount Vernon land. But historians say Trump's claim about Washington having a separate desk for business work is baseless.

When asked about the claim Washington had two desks, Joseph Ellis , a Pulitzer-prize winning historian and author of the book ""His Excellency: George Washington,"" told CNN, ""I don't know what he's talking about.""

Jeremi Suri, a history professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said ""Trump's statement is utter nonsense.

""It's an absurd allegation, basically,"" said Elizabeth Cobbs, a history professor at Texas A&M University and senior fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution. ""Certainly, every one of the founders had personal property that they maintained while they were in office. Whether they kept their materials in a separate desk or not is irrelevant.""

Mary Thompson, a research historian for Mount Vernon, Washington's home, told CNN that while there were two desks associated with Washington's presidency -- his presidential desk and one at Mount Vernon made for Washington after his term as president -- they did not exist together or side by side as Trump implied.

""I am not aware of Washington having had two desks in the study in the presidential mansion, which was a fairly small room,"" Thompson said.

Ellis noted that while Washington's correspondence during his presidency suggested he wanted to be at Mount Vernon, ""it wasn't because he had business back there but because that was his home, the place where he was felt most comfortable.""

""He didn't own a corporation or anything. He did have some land out in the west in what is now West Virginia, western Pennsylvania and Ohio, and he was trying to manage that,"" Ellis said.

The Emoluments Clause

Trump attacked critics who said that holding a G7 summit at one of his resorts would violate the Constitution. He said: ""You people with this phony Emoluments Clause.""

Facts First: There's nothing phony about the Constitution's prohibitions against the President receiving payments from foreign and domestic governments.

The clause on foreign emoluments, found in Article I, Section 9, says that ""no person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state.""

The clause on domestic emoluments, found in Article II, Section 1, says: ""The President shall, at stated times, receive for his services, a compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States, or any of them.""

Trump might have been attempting to argue that it is phony to apply the clause to his own activities, but, at very least, his wording left an inaccurate impression.

The deal with Turkey

""People have been trying to make this deal for years,"" Trump said of his ceasefire agreement with Turkey.

Facts First: The President's claim is baseless to the point of being nonsensical. The deal is a narrow agreement specifically tied to the Turkish offensive that followed Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from a Kurdish-held region of northern Syria, not an agreement that resolves long-standing regional disputes. Further, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush never sought to give Turkey anything like the concessionary terms of Trump's deal.

The Ukraine scandal

The whistleblower's account

""The whistleblower gave a false account,"" Trump said. He also said the whistleblower's account was ""totally false.""

Facts First: The whistleblower's account of Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was largely accurate. In fact, the rough transcript released by Trump himself showed that the whistleblower's three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct.

You can read a longer fact check here

The whistleblower's knowledge

""The whistleblower had second- and third-hand information. You remember that, it was a big problem,"" Trump said.

Facts First: Some of the whistleblower's information came from others, but some did not. Michael Atkinson, the Trump-appointed inspector general for the intelligence community, : Some of the whistleblower's information came from others, but some did not. Michael Atkinson, the Trump-appointed inspector general for the intelligence community, noted that the whistleblower had ""direct knowledge of certain alleged conduct.""

Atkinson also explained that the whistleblower was ""credible"" even about events on which the whistleblower did not have firsthand knowledge, such as the call: ""... although the Complainant's Letter acknowledged that the Complainant was not a direct witness to the President's July 25, 2019, telephone call with the Ukrainian President, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community determined that other information obtained during the ICIG's preliminary review supported the Complainant's allegations.""

The call document

Trump said, ""... I released a transcription then by stenographers of the exact conversation I had.""

Facts First: The document released by the White House explicitly : The document released by the White House explicitly says , on the first page, that it is not an exact transcript of the call.

""A Memorandum of a Telephone Conversation (TELCON) is not a verbatim transcript of a discussion. The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place. A number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record, including poor telecommunications connections and variations in accent and/or interpretation,"" the document says.

The whistleblower being 'gone'

""You never hear, what happened to the whistleblower? They're gone, because they've been discredited,"" Trump said.

Facts First: There is no evidence that either the first whistleblower (who filed the complaint about Trump's dealings with Ukraine) or the second whistleblower (whose lawyers say they have firsthand information corroborating claims made by the first whistleblower) are now somehow ""gone,"" let alone that they are ""gone"" because the first whistleblower was shown to be inaccurate.

""The whistleblowers have not vanished,"" Bradley Moss, a colleague of Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the two whistleblowers, said on Twitter.

The whistleblower and Adam Schiff

Trump said, ""So was there actually an informant? Maybe the informant was Schiff. It could be shifty Schiff. In my opinion it's possibly Schiff.""

Facts First: This is nonsensical. Schiff, a Democratic congressman and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, did not have access to the internal White House information the whistleblower revealed; he could not have told the whistleblower about the contents of Trump's phone call with Zelensky or other information the whistleblower reported. The whistleblower : This is nonsensical. Schiff, a Democratic congressman and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, did not have access to the internal White House information the whistleblower revealed; he could not have told the whistleblower about the contents of Trump's phone call with Zelensky or other information the whistleblower reported. The whistleblower said information about the call came from ""multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call.""

Schiff's comments

Trump said of the comments Schiff made about the Zelensky call at a committee hearing: ""So he made up a lie, and I released -- they never thought that I'd do this -- I released a transcription done by stenographers of the exact conversation I had. And now the game was up.""

Facts First: Schiff made his comments about Trump's call after the President released the rough transcript, not before. The White House issued the document on September 25. Schiff spoke at a House Intelligence Committee hearing on September 26.

The crowd in Dallas

""I had 25,000 people, close, in that arena,"" Trump said of his rally last week in Dallas.

Facts First: The American Airlines Center has a capacity of about 20,000. The El Paso Times : The American Airlines Center has a capacity of about 20,000. The El Paso Times reported a crowd of 18,500.

Trump paused mid-speech to ask the fire marshal to let more people in to fill empty space at floor level.

The crowd outside

Trump claimed that about ""at least"" 20,000 supporters were outside the arena during his Dallas rally.

Facts First: Trump's estimate was way off, though it was lower than the ""close to 30,000"" he had claimed during the speech. ""We didn't have 30K outside. Probably had upward of 5K outside,"" Dallas Police Department spokesman Sgt. Mitchell Warren told CNN in response to that previous Trump estimate.

Rally crowds

""I haven't had an empty seat at a rally,"" Trump said.

Facts First: There have been empty seats at various Trump rallies, including a : There have been empty seats at various Trump rallies, including a rally earlier this month in Minneapolis, a July rally in Greenville, North Carolina, an October 2018 rally in Houston and an April 2017 rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, according to journalists on the scene.

China's economic performance

A week after correctly saying that this is China's worst year for gross domestic product growth in ""27 years,"" Trump said it is China's worst year in ""57 years"": ""China is doing very poorly. Worst year they've had in 57 years. I wonder why. I wonder why. I'm sure you can't figure it out.""

Facts First: China's second-quarter GDP growth of 6.2% and third-quarter GDP growth of 6% were its : China's second-quarter GDP growth of 6.2% and third-quarter GDP growth of 6% were its worst since 1992 , 27 years ago.

While China's official figures are generally considered unreliable, there is no apparent basis for the ""57 years"" figure. (Trump has made clear that he knows that this is the reported figure, but he has repeatedly added additional years for no apparent reason.)

Who is paying the tariffs on China

Trump said the US is ""taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China, and they're eating the tariffs.""

Facts First: Americans make the actual tariff payments, and a : Americans make the actual tariff payments, and a bevy of economic studies has found that Americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs.

The length of the Syria mission

Trump said American troops were initially supposed to be in Syria for a mere ""30 days.""

Facts First: There was never any specific timeline for the US military's involvement in Syria, much less a timeline of only 30 days.

""There was never a 30-day timetable on the US presence in Syria,"" said Syria expert Steven Heydemann, a professor of government and director of the Middle East Studies program at Smith College. ""The previous administration, and officials serving in this administration, have never offered a fixed timetable for the US mission. Official statements have emphasized that the presence of US forces would be short, limited in scope, and small. But beyond general comments along those lines, there has been no statement indicating it would end after 30 days.""

The troops being withdrawn from Syria

""We're bringing our troops back home. I got elected on bringing our soldiers back home,"" Trump said.

Facts First: He is not bringing the troops back home, at least not at the moment.

Trump has announced that ""United States troops coming out of Syria will now redeploy and remain in the region to monitor the situation and prevent a repeat of 2014, when the neglected threat of ISIS raged across Syria and Iraq."" He has also announced that 1,800 more troops would be deployed to Saudi Arabia.

Trump conceded at the Cabinet meeting that the soldiers will be ""sent, initially, to different parts,"" but he claimed that they would ""ultimately"" return to the US.

The size of Miami International Airport

Touting the benefits of his Doral resort, Trump said it is right next to Miami International Airport, ""one of the biggest airports in the world -- some say it's the biggest.""

Facts First: Miami International is certainly not the biggest airport in the world.

The airport was not in the top 20 for passenger traffic in 2018 or 2017 . It ranked 15th in cargo traffic in 2018 and 14th in 2017, with less than half of the tonnage of cargo of top-ranked Hong Kong.

Though world airports authorities do not release rankings of airports' physical size, Miami International is not even close to the largest airport in the United States. Chicago's O'Hare, for example, occupies about 7,200 acres, Miami International 3,230 acres

Special elections in North Carolina

""You saw what happened in North Carolina: We picked up two seats that people didn't think we were going to pick up. That was two weeks ago,"" Trump said.

Facts First: The special elections in North Carolina were : The special elections in North Carolina were six weeks ago , not two weeks ago. While the race in the 9th District was considered competitive, the race in the 3rd District was expected by pollsters and analysts to be won easily by the Republican candidate.

Both seats had previously been held by Republicans, so the party did not pick them up. (Trump might have just been speaking informally.)

Sign up here to receive it every weekday morning.

(CNN) There are two plans afoot to oust President Donald Trump. One, impeachment, has transfixed Washington. But the earth is also moving in the other: the 2020 Democratic race.

The smoke has cleared from last week's CNN/New York Times debate , and Sen. Elizabeth Warren has suddenly emerged as the hot ticket for nomination, shaking up assumptions the race is former Vice President Joe Biden's to lose. But Warren is significantly to the left of much of middle America, and her proposals could spook voters -- even many of those who want Trump gone.

It's not impossible that Warren, who wants massive social and structural change in health care, taxation, education and the economy, could herald a political realignment. After all, Washington is often the last to get the news. No one here predicted how Trump ripped the Republican Party from its corporate, country club, internationalist roots and turned it into a working class, populist, anti-elite, isolationist force. But she's still a risky bet. And Trump is itching to run against what he's branding far left-wing ""socialism.""

(This is not just an American conundrum. It could shape the looming UK election as well, where Labour's Jeremy Corbyn hopes to become the most radical Prime Minister in generations — but could end up handing power back to the unpopular Tories.)

First voting is more than three months away, and Warren's boom has woken up centrists like Biden, small town Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. But sooner or later, Democratic primary voters -- generally far more progressive than the country as a whole -- will face a fundamental question: How far left is too far?

'Fascists, racists and Venus-ians'

Matteo Salvini, leader of Italy's far-right League party, reportedly mocked concerns that his weekend rally would attract fascists , joking that it would also bring people from the planet Venus. The event was held with fellow right-wing leaders Silvio Berlusconi and Giorgia Meloni in Rome -- just a few days short of the anniversary of Benito Mussolini's famous ""March on Rome.""

Kiu scias?

Remember covfefe?

In a new linguistic faux pas on Sunday, Trump substituted ""Esperanto,"" the globalist's dream language, for ""Esper,"" the surname of his Defense Secretary Mark Esper.

Was the President the victim of predictive text or a rogue spell checker in his since-deleted tweet? Or -- could he actually not know the name of the man he put in charge of the most lethal military in history? Kiu scias?

'Between MAGA hats and black mamas'

Impeachment forces lawmakers into tough choices; their vote on this most crucial of questions could doom them or pave the way to reelection.

No one is in a dicier spot than Doug Jones, the Democratic senator from fiercely pro-Trump Alabama. He won office on a wave of support from African American voters, among whom the President is deeply unpopular. Now, as CNN's Van Jones put it, the senator will be stuck ""between MAGA hats and black mamas"" when it's time to vote.

'That's not what I said'

What's got into Mick Mulvaney? The acting White House chief of staff has suddenly developed a most un-Trumpian compulsion to blurt out the truth.

In Thursday's train-wreck of a news conference , Mulvaney effectively admitted there was a quid pro quo with Ukraine -- the central allegation of Democrats' impeachment case. ""That's not what I said. That's what people said I said,"" he said on ""Fox News Sunday"" before being presented with video evidence of his comment.

When he was asked about Trump's aborted decision to host the G7 summit at one of his Florida resorts, he admitted, ""People think it looks lousy,"" referring to fears of self-dealing. Then he offered this excuse: ""(Trump) still considers himself to be in the hospitality business.""

Of course, as President, Trump is supposed to have walled himself off from his hotel and real estate empire to avoid conflicts of interest. Mulvaney's suggestion of the exact opposite makes this the second time in three days his frankness has people asking how long before he's sacked. CNN reported Sunday that Trump's already having second thoughts.

Mulvaney could be getting it all out into the open, with an aim to minimize and normalize behavior that would once have been thought impeachable. But he may also be about to join an infamous DC club of power brokers remembered for their classic ""Washington gaffes"" -- as defined by former CNNer and New Republic editor Michael Kinsley.

A Washington gaffe, of course, is when a politician messes up and tells the truth.

'If the nesting doll fits...'

That's how Hillary Clinton's spokesman Nick Merrill responded when Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard rejected the former secretary of state's claim that she was being groomed for a third-party run by Russia.

Clinton must still be simmering at the role the Russians played in helping Trump win in 2016 (she also accused former Green Party candidate Jill Stein of being a Moscow ""asset."") But her attack could backfire: First, she's elevating Gabbard, who barely registers in most polls. Second, evoking a Kremlin puppet master revives the mistrust seeded by the original Russian operation. It's the meddling scam that just keeps on giving.

(CNN) While the latest head-to-head polls show President Donald Trump trailing Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren , translating those polls into votes for the Democratic nominee next fall won't be easy.

Earlier this month, Elizabeth Warren announced that she would not hold big-dollar fundraisers , even if she becomes the Democratic nominee. Within hours, though, her aides added a caveat: This pledge did not apply to fundraisers she would do on behalf of the Democratic National Committee.

This important addendum should come as no surprise to those who have been following the problems at the DNC for the last several years. With just one year left before election day, the DNC doesn't have the money , the data or the team to adequately support the eventual nominee. Filings from late September reveal an anemic DNC mired in debt while the RNC has senior staff set up already in a whopping 19 states

Elizabeth Warren, and every other candidate who appeared on the debate stage last week, knows that it will be nearly impossible to win the White House without a competent national party apparatus — especially if there is a protracted fight for the nomination that stretches into the spring.

Voter turnout is what will ultimately decide who wins the 2020 election. This election will not be about winning over undecided voters with television ads. There are few undecided voters, now that nearly every American has an opinion about President Trump (only 5% have ""no opinion"" about his job performance). But it doesn't matter whether more than half of voters want him out of the White House if they don't show up to vote when it counts.

That's why money — and enough time to spend it — matters.

Turning out voters takes enormous resources on the ground in every state. It takes money far enough in advance that a campaign can build out a ground game with enough time to identify middle- to low-propensity voters, target them with digital ads that are laser-focused on their interests and bombard them with information to get them to the polls at the right place and on the right day.

It takes field staff knocking on the right doors at the right time so that a candidate banks as many votes as possible when early voting starts. That makes it easier come Election Day, when field staff can focus on targeting the remaining stragglers. It's a game of millimeters.

(This is why Hillary Clinton and her team sound silly when they crow about winning the popular vote in 2016. All that means is they wasted time and money targeting the wrong voters. I assure you that the Trump team didn't waste a moment's thought on getting extra votes in Texas. They spent their resources in, you guessed it, Pennsylvania Wisconsin, and Michigan .)

Let's step back a moment. Last week, The New York Times published an in-depth story about voters in a swing county in Pennsylvania. The interview that opens the piece is with Mark Graham, an Obama voter who switched to supporting Trump in 2016. He hasn't been impressed by the President's performance (he called Trump's behavior ""a joke""), but after watching the Democratic primary debates in September, he told the Times he couldn't back any of the Democrats either.

Then came the political chaos of the past few weeks. Now Graham says, ""I'd vote for the Democratic nominee no matter who it is at this point."" Upon reading that, the DNC may be gaining confidence -- that's one more vote in Pennsylvania, right?

But do you see the problem? Graham doesn't actually like any of the Democratic candidates on that stage; he just happens to like Trump less. He's what you'd have in your database as a high-propensity voter (he votes every four years) with a low attachment score for the eventual nominee (he's not particularly motivated to vote for the Democrat).

Graham is not undecided -- but once the general election is here and he's bombarded with negative ads about the Democratic nominee on social media, specifically targeted to his interests, Graham may well throw up his hands and decide not to vote at all.

This means the DNC needs someone to visit Mr. Graham and remind him of all the things he's feeling right now about President Trump and make sure he doesn't decide to stay home in November of 2020. He doesn't need to hear more about Medicare for All canceling his private insurance; he needs to hear about President Trump's latest mess.

But who's going to knock on that door? And, unless The New York Times writes a profile on every voter in Erie, how will the DNC know who else to talk to and what to say?

While the Democratic primary candidates are raising gobs of money , they are also spending it largely in ways designed to help them defeat their fellow Democrats in the primaries, not to defeat Donald Trump in the general election.

On the one hand, Democratic contenders are building miniature ground games in early primary states, which would be good, except that Pennsylvania and Ohio are not early primary states. You don't need a ground game in South Carolina to beat Donald Trump come next fall.

Building those early ground games, of course, is exactly why the party committees exist. But the DNC isn't exactly inspiring confidence that the organization will be ready for the fight come 2020.

New FEC reports were filed last night and the gulf continues to widen. The DNC raised under $7 million , with $8.6 million on hand and more than $7 million in debt. The Republican National Committee, on the other hand, raised more than $27 million and has over $59 million on hand with no debt. This means the Trump campaign and the RNC combined in the third quarter to raise over $125 million.

Add that to the multiple staff shakeups at various Democratic party committees and, well, yikes.

Voters have strong feelings about the President and about the direction of the Democratic Party . But feelings don't equal turnout. A recent experiment , for example, showed that Democratic voters who were exposed to news coverage about some of the left-leaning policy positions taken by Democratic candidates at the debate became slightly more enthusiastic about voting for the eventual nominee of their party.

But the survey also showed two big red flags. First, independents who read about the party's leftward turn were 6% less likely to vote Democratic.

Second, the experiment also found that the results ""did not indicate [Democratic voters] were more motivated to vote and campaign for the eventual nominee than those who hadn't read about them.""

This is why campaigns and parties spend hundreds of millions of dollars on targeted digital ads, and on building a robust ground game. And while the President may be turning off non-white voters in Florida , Democrats aren't going to win that state or any other swing state unless their voters actually show up to—you guessed it—vote.

But the eventual Democratic nominee won't have a field army to greet them at the Panhandle gates.

We may spend a lot of time talking about the polls in the media, but the candidates who appeared on last week's debate stage would be wise to remember: Polls don't vote."

As the stalemate continues, some students are playing board games or making origami instead of learning in class -- and some parents are torn about which side to support.

""I support both sides, but I think they need to come to a mutual agreement and give a little on both sides because they're only hurting the kids,"" said Dominique Williams, the mother of two teens on the city's tough west side.

The union wants smaller class sizes, more support staff and higher raises for all educators. The city has offered some concessions , but said it can't afford to meet all their demands.

Former teacher Elizabeth Warren joins the picket lines

Teachers got a boost of support Tuesday from Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren joins striking teachers Tuesday in Chicago.

""Everyone in America should support you in this strike,"" said Warren, herself a former teacher.

""The reason is because when you go out and fight, you don't just fight for yourselves. You fight for their children of this city, and the children of this country. I believe in public education. I believe it is time in America to make a new investment in public education.""

One of the greatest needs is for more social workers in schools. That's especially true in Chicago, where many students struggle with poverty, violence and grief at a very young age

""Everything is so different from the way it used to be. It seems like things are just getting more and more chaotic as the years go by,"" Williams said.

""A lot of these kids do need help. ... Some of these kids do need that social worker because they can't talk to their parent. Or they can't talk to their friend. So they'll talk to that social worker because it's a separate entity away from what they got going on.""

One school social worker said she has to split her time between four buildings and 1,039 students.

""I'm tired of telling kids that I can only be there 1 1/2 days of the entire week,"" she said. ""We can't plan our crises according to when I'm there.""

Darian Martyniuk, the father of two elementary school students, said he appreciates what the teachers are fighting for. But they may be asking too much from Chicago Public Schools.

""While I think the teachers have some noble and worthy demands that need to be addressed, I think the union leadership is at best behaving cynically, at worst using whatever leverage they think they have to squeeze the most out of a system that doesn't have anything left to give,"" Martuniuk said.

""Additional staffing like librarians, nurses, counselors ... there are legitimate teacher needs for more. But the union leadership doesn't seem to understand the finance structure of CPS and how it is a limited pool of money. You can't just keep raising taxes year after year because legally they can't do that.""

'I'm pissed,' one mother says

Mayor Lori Lightfoot said even though she and the union want some of the same things, it's time for the union to stop striking.

""There is a finite pot of money. We don't have unlimited cash to keep funding the things that are aspirational and maybe things that, on values that we share,"" Lightfoot said.

""We have to live within our means. That's what the taxpayers expect of us, and that's what we're going to do.""

Williams, the mother who has two teens on the city's west side, said the dueling sides need to stop bickering.

""I'm pissed at the fact that the kids have been out for so long,"" she said. ""They need their class time.""

During Tuesday's bargaining, CTU Chief of Staff Jennifer Johnson said 25 coaches took part in a ""powerful meeting,"" during which they called for more investment in equipment, uniforms and transportation and more pay for coaches. Union officials and schools officials also discussed class sizes and staffing, she said.

""There was progress but we're still clear that we have not landed on just terms yet,"" Johnson said. ""We are clear that we're looking for a substantial investment that addresses our members and students' concerns.""

Johnson said picket lines will be suspended Wednesday as parents, teachers, students and allies plan to converge on downtown Chicago for a rally.

It's lost on no one, of course, she's talking about Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

After making that point clear during the debate last week in Ohio -- calling for a ""reality check to Elizabeth"" and dismissing some Warren plans as ""pipe dreams"" -- Klobuchar is scrambling to turn her moment on stage into momentum on the campaign trail.

Klobuchar, who has so far qualified for all of the primary debates but continues to see single-digit polling numbers, is in danger of missing the November debate stage.

With less than a month to qualify, a fresh sense of urgency surrounded her candidacy as her green campaign bus rumbled across Iowa on a visit this past weekend. Her itinerary was shaped by a swath of counties President Donald Trump turned red in 2016 that President Barack Obama twice carried.

At every stop, whether shaking hands with one potential supporter at a time or addressing a room of a few hundred, Klobuchar made the case again and again: She can win in Trump country and Democrats can ill afford to choose a nominee who can't.

In this unsettled stage of the race, she's testing the appetite for whether hard-core party activists who dependably attend Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses are open to backing a candidate who promotes her progressive record even as she touts the number of Republicans -- or former Republicans -- who approach her to pledge their support.

""Who do you want heading that ticket? Someone who can really win in the Midwest,"" Klobuchar told CNN in an interview aboard her chartered bus, emblazoned with the slogan ""Amy for America"" in giant letters. ""I'm the only one with the track record of actually winning red congressional districts time and time again and suburban purple districts.""

The Minnesota senator carried so-called Trump counties -- 42 of them, she proudly pointed out to her Iowa audiences, as she won a third Senate term last fall. She argues that her presidential candidacy could also build a broader coalition to help Democratic candidates win control of the Senate next year.

But in the short term, it's an open question whether her pragmatic message can be a winning one in the crowded 2020 Democratic primary.

""She has a very refreshing, common sense way about her that is very appealing,"" said Andy McKean, a longtime Iowa state legislator who left the Republican Party earlier this year in disgust. Now a Democrat, he endorsed Klobuchar, saying: ""She's very practical, but she's very progressive.""

It's that balance Klobuchar is working to navigate.

Her rising confidence, which was apparent on the debate stage last week in Ohio, clearly followed her at most every stop of her three-day Iowa visit. One voter after another conceded they took notice of her for the first time when she aggressively challenged Warren on the price tag of her health care plan.

Betsy Pilkington, a retired teacher from North English, Iowa, said she was so impressed by Klobuchar's most recent debate performance that she went online and made a small contribution. It was the biggest fundraising boomlet of Klobuchar's campaign, aides said, raising more than $1 million in the first 24 hours after the debate. (By comparison, Klobuchar raised a total $4.8 million from July to September.)

""For the first time, I thought she came across more forceful and she was a force to recon with,"" Pilkington said in an interview after meeting Klobuchar at a coffee shop along her tour. ""I liked what she had to say, that she was more centrist and she wasn't afraid to go up against Elizabeth Warren.""

Pragmatic and progressive

Klobuchar and Warren, who are colleagues in the Senate and competitors on the campaign trail, illustrate the tensions coursing through the Democratic Party and the lingering uncertainty over what type of candidate is the most electable.

The root of their disagreement is over the price tag of a series of programs, including ""Medicare for All"" and free college. Klobuchar was among the Democrats who did not sign onto the sweeping legislation sponsored by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, which would eliminate private health insurance.

In the wake of persistent questioning of Warren on the debate stage from Klobuchar and others, the Massachusetts senator said Sunday for the first time that she is working on a plan to pay for Medicare for All and would reveal it in the coming weeks.

That development prompted this reply from Klobuchar: ""I think if she had a good answer, we would have seen it by now. But I look forward to seeing it.""

Their candidacies are far from equal -- Warren's robust grassroots fundraising prowess and wild enthusiasm apparent at most every one of her campaign stops make that evident -- but Klobuchar's assertive questioning of Warren on the debate stage clearly found a receptive audience.

""How is college going to be free? How is health care going to be free? How are we going to close down all private health insurance?"" said Susan Strodtbeck, a retired teacher who saw Klobuchar at a town hall meeting in Davenport. ""I'm sorry. We can't do that.""

When she asked Klobuchar about ""all that free stuff,"" the senator's face came alive as she joked that the only free offerings her campaign had were the chocolate chip cookies at the back of the room.

While Klobuchar has offered a pragmatic progressive message since she entered the race in February, the decision to sharpen her argument against Warren and Sanders, another top-tier candidate, is a strategic one. Time is running out for her to break out of the crowded field, with a little more than 100 days remaining until the Iowa caucuses kick off the voting early next year.

After sipping a cup of hot coffee, Klobuchar settled back into her seat on the bus, and explained why she believes that her rivals aren't leveling with voters.

""I'm not at all likening them to Donald Trump, who's plainly lying all the time,"" she said. ""But I'm saying that I think this calls for a time when we build trust with people, not by promising everything for free. I know that's appealing. I would love to have everything for free. You'd love to have everything for free, but I think people know that's not going to happen.""

She dismissed the possibility of backlash from liberal Democrats to her sharp criticism of Warren and Sanders. She defends her progressive voting record, while making clear that the party needs to appeal to a wider audience of Americans eager to see Trump replaced in the White House.

""There are independents and moderate Republicans -- maybe they didn't vote last time, but they're watching,"" Klobuchar said. ""So we better make sure that the message we're sending out there is one that brings them in as well.""

As she posed for pictures with voters at a brewery in Waterloo, Jerry Rasmussen stood and watched from a distance. He's a retired truck driver who said he's fed up with the Trump presidency and learned about Klobuchar from a friend in neighboring Minnesota.

""He's a Republican and says she does a great job for him up there, you know?"" Rasmussen said. ""I hope she can get stronger and pull ahead."""

Buttigieg campaign spokesperson Chris Meagher confirmed both Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan provided details on several names, two of which were eventually hired, in a statement to Bloomberg News.

Nina Wornhoff, now a data manager for the Buttigieg campaign, previously worked as a machine learning engineer at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the couple’s philanthropic arm. Eric Mayefsky, a digital analytics adviser for the Democrat presidential candidate, worked at Facebook between 2010-2014.

Newly confirmed details of Zuckerberg’s communication with the Buttigieg campaign is a “rare example of direct political involvement from one of tech’s most powerful executives,” Bloomberg’s Tyler Pager and Kurt Wagner write.

Of course, news of the emails is not the first time the two have crossed paths. In 2017, Zuckerberg and Buttigieg, both Harvard University alumni, hosted a Facebook Live discussion during the Facebook CEO’s Midwest listening tour. The South Bend mayor made headlines in May when he expressed support for additional regulations on Silicon Valley giants like Facebook, despite his relationship with Zuckerberg.

Bloomberg News’ report comes as a new poll released Monday shows that Buttigieg has risen to third place in the key primary state of Iowa.

The Suffolk University/USA TODAY poll states that former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) enjoy 18 percent and 17 percent approval from voters, while Buttigieg has garnered 13 percent. This boomlet comes after an obvious affectation of moderation during last week’s primary debate — reversing course after months of trashing Trump voters, particularly evangelicals, as morally bankrupt and hypocritical."

Starting next month, Facebook will label publications that are ""wholly or partially under the editorial control of their government as state-controlled media,"" the company said in a blog post Monday. These Facebook pages will be held to ""a higher standard of transparency because they combine the opinion-making influence of a media organization with the strategic backing of a state.""

Last year, YouTube added labels to videos that are posted by state-funded media outlets, linking to the broadcaster's Wikipedia page. But outlets like the BBC, a publicly funded broadcaster independent from the government, get a different label than an outlet like Russia Today.

""We expect Facebook's efforts to label content in this manner to be about as apt as its blocking of RT's pages containing Borscht recipes last week,"" RT spokesperson Anna Belkina told CNN Business. ""We will likely see the same labeling shenanigans as we did from Google, for whom some publicly funded outlets were more ""state funded"" than others, facts notwithstanding.""

Even as it takes steps to protect the next election, Facebook continues to grapple with bad actors from the last US presidential election. The company announced Monday that it removed 50 Instagram accounts and one Facebook account, some of which posed as locals from US swing states. Facebook says the accounts ""showed some links"" to the Internet Research Agency, a troll group with links to the Kremlin and a focus of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.

On a conference call with reporters Monday, Zuckerberg said the company's ability to proactively catch and disclose these coordinated networks of accounts shows that Facebook's defensive systems are working. He also stressed that Facebook now has more than 35,000 people working on safety and security efforts.

The policy updates and account takedowns come as Facebook and Zuckerberg confront continued scrutiny from politicians on Capitol Hill and on the campaign trail. Democratic presidential candidates including Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden have leveled sharp criticisms against the company in recent days for its policy of exempting ads by politicians from third-party fact-checking. The criticism followed the company's decision to allow a video ad from President Donald Trump's reelection campaign that falsely accused Biden of corruption for his role in Ukraine policy during the Obama administration.

When pressed about the policy again on the call, Zuckerberg stressed that other tech and media companies also ran the ad. ""I know that Facebook has been at the center of a lot of these debates,"" he said. But, he added, it's ""really not a policy area where we are an outlier."" (Broadcast networks and stations are required by law to run the ad; CNN, which is not subject to the same laws and regulations because it is a cable network, has opted not to air it.)

Zuckerberg once again framed his company's stance on political advertising -- and its decision not to do away with it on the platform entirely, despite its minimal contribution to Facebook's bottom line -- as a matter of giving people a ""voice.""

""This isn't about money,"" he said. ""Ads are an important way to get your message out and in front of people... Banning ads would favor incumbents and whoever the media would cover most."" At another point on the call, however, Zuckerberg conceded that incumbents ""can raise more money"" than their challengers to pay for more ads on Facebook and other platforms.

Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify before Congress on Wednesday in a hearing that is expected to focus on Facebook's plans for a digital currency. At least some of the scrutiny over Facebook's crypto plans could give the company even more power, at a time when its size and influence are already under investigation at the federal level.

In the face of that scrutiny, Zuckerberg has engaged in what appears to be a public relations campaign to put himself out there more. He gave a speech at Georgetown University last week describing politicians' calls to clamp down on tech companies as an effort to restrict the freedom of expression, followed by interviews with several major media outlets.

""I get that a lot of people are angry at us,"" Zuckerberg said in an interview with NBC Nightly News' Lester Holt that is set to air Monday night. ""Part of growing up for me has just been realizing that it is more important to be understood than it is to be liked, and I believe it very strongly.""

It's unclear how much Monday's announcements, or Zuckerberg's PR campaign, will do to make politicians like Facebook again."

""Tulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country,"" the Vermont independent tweeted . ""People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset.""

Sanders does not name Hillary Clinton in the tweet, but his comments appear to be aimed at the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, whose claim last week on a podcast with former Obama adviser David Plouffe that the Russians are ""grooming"" a Democrat in the 2020 presidential primary to run as a third-party candidate and champion their interests has caused a backlash. Clinton also accused 2016 Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein of being a ""Russian asset.""

Clinton's team on Monday declined to comment to CNN about Sanders' tweet.

Gabbard, who endorsed Sanders over Clinton during the 2016 presidential election, responded to her on Friday, calling her ""queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party."" Gabbard also said in a tweeted video message on Sunday, ""If they can falsely portray me as a traitor, then they can do it to anyone.""

""That's exactly the message that they want to get across to you: that if you stand up against Hillary and the party power brokers, if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message,"" Gabbard said.

""I am not a Russian spy,"" Stein said. ""I think this is a completely unhinged conspiracy theory for which there is absolutely no basis in fact. Not for myself and not for Tulsi Gabbard. I think it's really outrageous that Hillary Clinton is trying to promote this crazy idea.""

Clinton's team, after receiving bipartisan criticism, said the former secretary of state was saying that Republicans and President Donald Trump were grooming the congresswoman.

""Folks, listen to the podcast. She doesn't say the Russians are grooming anyone. It was a question about Republicans,"" Clinton spokesperson Nick Merrill tweeted on Friday.

Sanders is not the only 2020 Democratic candidate to weigh in on the controversy.

Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas also defended Gabbard, saying she ""is not being groomed by anyone"" and that the focus of the campaign should be on the economy, climate change and other issues affecting Americans.

""That's not correct. Tulsi is not being groomed by anyone. She is her own person,"" he told reporters after delivering a keynote address Saturday at the Alabama Democratic Conference Semi-Annual Convention in Birmingham. ""Obviously (she) has served this country, continues to serve this country, in uniform, in Congress, as a candidate for presidency, so I think those facts speak for themselves.""

South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg dismissed the claim on Sunday, saying that ""there is no basis for that"" and ""statements like that ought to be backed by evidence.""

""I don't know what the basis is for that,"" he told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of The Union."" ""But I consider her to be a competitor. I respect her service. I also have very different views than she does, especially on foreign policy, and I would prefer to have that argument in terms of policy, which is what we do at debates and what we're doing as we go forward.""

The analysis finds 66 percent of millennials actually have no student debt, “either because they did not attend college or did not acquire debt in the process,” says the report by Beth Akers, Manhattan Institute senior fellow.

The student debt crisis is overblown: most millennials are not drowning in student debt. 66% of millennials have no student debt at all. And those who do have debt tend to have modest burdens relative to their income. https://t.co/MHkgJ3Qzip via @BethAkers_ — Manhattan Institute (@ManhattanInst) October 16, 2019

“The typical graduate will have borrowed $28,500 in pursuit of a bachelor’s degree,” the report continues. “That can be repaid with monthly payments of $181 on a standard, 20-year repayment plan.”

Secondly, only 6 percent of student borrowers have more than $100,000 in debt. Most of these borrowers have graduate or professional degrees and often come from families with higher income.

“More than one-third of outstanding student debt is held by individuals who are themselves in the highest income quartile,” with individual income greater than $97,000, the report observes. “Typically, those in trouble are not the ones with high debt but those who never completed college – default rates are highest for those with less than $5,000 in debt.”

Thirdly, the report notes the mean income for all millennials – including those without college degrees – is $46,092:

Under the existing income-driven repayment programs for all federal student loans … borrowers with this level of income would never be required to pay more than $173 per month (4.5% of pretax income), regardless of how much they had borrowed.

“The typical millennial has no student debt,” Akers writes. “Even among those who pursued higher education and borrowed to fund it, a typical household with two college-educated workers has more than $100,000 in annual income and pays less than $400 monthly on their loans.”

Instead of loan forgiveness, Akers recommends that federal intervention “focus on the small subset of borrowers with unmanageable debt burdens and ensure that they still repay what they can afford. Those programs already exist.”

The report is released as Democrats plan to reauthorize the Higher Education Act with provisions that would allow for massive “stealth” student loan forgiveness, as Preston Cooper wrote at Forbes.

Continuing along the path of the Obama administration, which ultimately allowed more student loans to be “forgiven,” the Democrats’ plan contains a proposal that changes how loan payments for student borrowers are calculated based on income. Cooper observes:

Currently, borrowers in these plans pay an amount equal to 10% of their income above 150% of the poverty line (about $25,000 for a household of two). House Democrats would raise that threshold to 250% of the poverty line, slashing monthly payments for some borrowers and eliminating them for others.

As it stands now, student debt after 20 years of repayment is “forgiven.” Raising the threshold of the poverty line, however, means American taxpayers will be stuck with billions in student loan “forgiveness.”

In October 2018, Jason Delisle and Cody Christensen wrote at National Review the Democrats’ plan “would let borrowers out of loans they could afford to pay back.”

They explain that a typical student borrower has an income of about $35,000 and, currently, would pay $140 per month in loan repayment, with “forgiveness” after 20 years of repayment. An increase in the income exemption to 250 percent of the poverty line, however, “means the borrower’s initial payments would be just $39.”

While payments would grow as the borrower’s income increases, under the Democrats’ plan payments “would still be so low that they would barely cover the interest on the $30,000 loan,” the authors noted. “That would mean all of the original principal balance would have to be forgiven after 20 years of payments.”

Many Democrat presidential hopefuls claim college graduates are crushed by student debt that prevents them from getting ahead and stimulating the economy.

Both 2020 candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have plans to cancel student debt.

Sanders’ proposal would eliminate all existing student loan debt in the country. His campaign website states, if elected, he will “cancel the entire $1.6 trillion in outstanding student debt for the 45 million borrowers who are weighed down by the crushing burden of student debt.”

Elizabeth Warren’s plan contains caps, but would still cancel $1.25 trillion in student debt for 42 million people. Her proposal would forgive $50,000 in student loan debt for every person with a household income of $100,000. Those whose households make between $100,000 and $250,000 would have a portion of their student debt forgiven.

In August, the Wall Street Journal editorial board minced no words in asserting American taxpayers are victims of a student loan “scam.” The board noted the New York Federal Reserve’s quarterly household debt survey released the week before showed more Americans are defaulting on their student loans.

The editors observed delinquent student loans have risen dramatically since 2012, when Barack Obama was president, and have overtaken delinquencies in credit card payments, auto loans, and mortgages.

During the Obama era, they noted, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) “scored student loans as a government profit center by underestimating the growth in income-based repayment plans.”

Now, however, CBO predicts taxpayers will be on the hook for $306.7 billion over the next ten years.

Of course, with the influx of taxpayer funds to pick up the tab, the WSJ board points out income-based repayment plans “have also encouraged schools to raise prices and enroll students who probably won’t earn enough to pay off their loans,” knowing those students ultimately will be “forgiven” by taxpayers.

As it happens, “Americans who borrow more than they can repay typically default first on student loans,” the editors say. But, while defaults on mortgages and car loans have serious consequences, individuals who default on student loans “are encouraged to enroll in income-based repayment plans.”

The editorial board warns of substantial losses for American taxpayers due to the Obama-era repayment scheme that current Democrats plan to take to new heights.

“All of this is worth keeping in mind as Democrats promise to save taxpayers billions by taking over other private industries and expanding the cradle-to-grave entitlement state,” the board says."

Perry is a journalist and historian. He's the senior academic adviser to the History Department at the University of Minnesota. Follow him on Twitter .

(CNN) As the Republic of Venice slowly slid into the 18th century, its economic power was waning while military threats piled up all around it. Inside the city, though, it maintained a vibrant cultural and political life.

When its elites, visiting nobility, and the lower status citizens of the city wanted to mingle, they all would put on masks. Far from the elaborate contraptions sold on every corner in the touristy city, mostly these masks didn't do much to conceal identity. Instead, they provided a polite fiction that allowed people to cross social lines without threatening social norms. Early modern Venetians had masks; today, politicians have Twitter.

Last week, Sen. Mitt Romney told The Atlantic writer McKay Coppins that he had a secret Twitter account , offering just enough details that Ashley Feinberg, who writes for Slate, could deduce its identity . Feinberg reasoned that Romney would want to follow his family members, including his grandchildren, some of whom have relatively few followers. Feinberg introduced us to Twitter user @qaws9876 , aka Pierre Delecto. When Coppins confronted Romney with the deduction, the senator replied only, ""C'est moi"" (or ""it's me,"" in French).

The revelations about Romney's activity on Twitter come at a curious time for the ""sometimes Trump"" Republican caucus, whose ranks include Romney. These Republicans, who include both lawmakers and writers , took principled positions against the president when he was running for the GOP nomination, mostly backed him against Clinton or suggested they might futilely write-in another option.

Since Trump's election, they have oscillated back and forth from quiescent subjugation to periodic public complaint about presidential conduct. These complaints never seem to result in Republicans organizing against Trump from within. Only rarely has this cohort voted against Trump's norms in Congress ( with a few notable exceptions ) and never have they publicly campaigned for Democrats. In fact, as Elizabeth Warren seems to have emerged as at least a co-frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, most ""Sometimes Trump"" writers seem to be setting themselves up to reluctantly support the president

But now with Trump and his cronies — both staff like Mick Mulvaney and on-again off-again personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani — almost daily confessing to transgressions, it's both easier for Republicans like Romney to stand against the president and harder for him to stay quiet.

Twitter is a performative space, at least if you have a public account. Whereas Facebook has sophisticated layering of privacy options — often bewildering to the casual user — that encourage participation within closed, selected, networks of mutual connections, Twitter promotes the short, loud blast. It's a place that works very well for sharing news and for making like-minded connections. Its public nature also comes with the serious risk of harassment and bullying.

His mask had come off, but he hadn't used this private account to do anything especially significant. Pierre Delecto only tweeted 10 times. Feinberg noted that a number of responses were aimed at journalists directly criticizing Romney and other Republicans for a lack of spine in the face of Trump's flagrant misconduct. Wait and see, Romney seemed to suggest, but there's nothing revelatory here. We've been waiting to see for a long time.

I'm a historian of pre-modern Venice and often think about the efforts that medieval democracy undertook to maintain social order, protect their electoral systems, and thrive in a fraught space between different spheres of power (Rome, the Holy Roman Empire, Byzantium and then the Ottomans, Catholics versus Protestants, and more over the centuries).

Their masks have enhanced a reputation for secrecy and debauchery, that ""anything goes"" once the masks are on. In the recent book, ""Venice Incognito,"" though, historian James Johnson argues that masks were in many cases a tool of the status quo, ""permitting contact among unequals through fictive concealment. Rather than obscuring identities, masks affirmed their permanence."" The donning of a mask created a fiction that affirmed social structures, rather than threatening them.

Mitt Romney and a handful of other Republican leaders have a chance to act. But they are going to have do so without masks and, most critically, they are going to have to risk upsetting their own delicate position. Romney and the rest will have to stop performing principled resistance and actually resist. Trump will eventually be gone, but for America to move past this difficult moment, all the masks must come off."

Profiles originating in Russia had since the beginning of this year been building a network of accounts on Instagram designed to look like groups in swing states, the company said . Instagram is owned by

Although the accounts posed as Americans from all sides of the political spectrum, many were united in their opposition to the candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden, according to Graphika , a social media investigations company that Facebook asked to analyze the accounts. The Russian trolls who used social media to interfere in the 2016 election employed a similar tactic , going after Hillary Clinton from the right and also trying to spread a perception on the left that Clinton was not liberal enough and that liberals and African Americans especially shouldn't bother voting for her.

The accounts Facebook revealed Monday, 50 of which were on Instagram and one of which was on Facebook, were designed to look like they were advocating on a broad range of issues across American life.

Accounts with usernames like @black.queen.chloe and @michigan_black_community_ looked like they were run by black activists. There were also pro and anti-Trump accounts, and accounts posing as feminists, LGBTQ rights advocates, and environmentalists. Other account names included @stop.trump2020, @bernie.2020__, @iowa.patriot, and @feminist_agenda_, according to Graphika.

Facebook said the accounts combined had more than 250,000 followers, more than half of which were based in the U.S. Facebook did not disclose how many of those followers were real and how many might have been fake or bot accounts designed to make the main accounts look more legitimate. Facebook says it has removed the accounts.

""It looked like there was a systematic focus on attacking Biden from both sides,"" Graphika director of investigations Ben Nimmo, who analyzed the accounts, told CNN Business.

In a statement responding to the news, Biden campaign spokesman TJ Ducklo said, ""We applaud Facebook for disclosing the existence of these fake accounts and shutting them down. ... [But] Donald Trump continues to benefit from spreading false information, all the while Facebook profits from amplifying his lies and debunked conspiracy theories on their platform. If Facebook is truly committed to protecting the integrity of our elections, they would immediately take down Trump's ads that attempt to gaslight the American people.""

Nimmo also observed attacks on other candidates, including Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, but said those attacks seemed more the result of ""character building"" in which the accounts were sharing content to bolster their respective personas -- for instance, liberal-looking accounts attacked Trump, while conservative-looking accounts posted negative content about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

""Among the accounts focused on black activism, there was strong support for Bernie Sanders along with a moderate amount of content opposing Kamala Harris,"" Graphika said in its analysis. ""Education reform and student debt relief were two of the most commonly mentioned reasons for supporting Sanders, while Harris's record as a California DA was mentioned as a reason to oppose her candidacy. Mixed in with these was a small amount of content attacking Joe Biden, primarily due to gaffes related to his previous handling of racial issues.""

Nimmo said the accounts sent just under 75,000 posts, the majority of which were not directly related to the 2020 election, but to broader political and social issues in the US.

Facebook said Monday those behind the operation had taken steps to conceal their identities and locations. The company did not publicly say how it had determined the accounts were linked to the Internet Research Agency but said it had shared details with law enforcement.

The campaign mostly recycled existing memes and posts from real American news organizations and political groups.

""This wasn't Russians targeting Americans with Russian content, this was Russians targeting Americans with American content,"" Nimmo said.

The decision to recycle existing content, rather than create new material, might have been part of the campaign's strategy to conceal its Russian links, Nimmo said. However, errors in some of the accounts' posts suggested the accounts weren't run by native English speakers.

""What the future for their children will be?"" the caption read on one post apparently criticizing Americans who don't remember the Confederacy fondly. Another account posted ""What a bullsh**.""

Nathaniel Gleicher, who leads Facebook's team investigating foreign influence operations, said the company had caught the operation in its early stages and that the Russian group had been focusing on audience building. Gleicher said the accounts were ""trying to make themselves look like ordinary citizens"" in a way that could later have lent credibility to their posts.

Facebook has taken extensive steps to crack down on foreign disinformation on its platforms since the 2016 election, including hiring former intelligence officials to root out campaigns like those run from Russia. Gleicher said that the steps Facebook had taken appeared to make it difficult for the Russian accounts ""to build the following among authentic communities.""

""People in Russia are still trying this,"" Nimmo told CNN Business on Monday. But, he said, they are finding it a lot harder because the social media companies ""are hunting them.""

""In 2016, you could have set up an account posing as a Tennessee Republican and have it registered to a Russian phone number,"" he noted.

Facebook also announced Monday that it had removed several networks of Iranian accounts, some of which targeted Americans. One of the accounts directed audiences to content about Black Lives Matter -- a tactic that was very popular among the Russian trolls in 2016 . The network had a relatively small following of more than 7,000 accounts.

While most of the focus on online foreign interference in the US has been devoted to Russia, over the past 12 months, Facebook has detected multiple Iranian campaigns targeting the United States."

It might drag on even longer if strikers reject a tentative agreement reached last week between the company and negotiators for the United Auto Workers union.

The negotiating team and union leadership are both recommending that the nearly 50,000 strikers vote to ratify the new four-year agreement. Results of the vote will be released Friday evening.

But there's a lot of anger towards GM among rank-and-file workers. The tentative deal reached last week would pay members an $11,000 signing bonus and raise hourly pay for veteran workers 6% over the life of the contract, to $32.32.

It also will allow many temporary workers to become permanent employees, which will significantly improve their pay and benefits. And the union got GM to drop its demand that workers pay a much greater percentage of their own health care costs.

But the UAW struck out in its efforts to have GM shutter some of its production in Mexico and relocate it to the United States to revive doomed plants here.

GM GM As part of the tentative agreement,agreed to save the Hamtramck assembly plant in Detroit. But the decision isn't related to Mexico. GM plans to use the plant to build electric trucks at an undetermined date more than a year away. Once production of sedans currently being built at Hamtramck ends in 2020, the plant will go dark for an extended period.

The union was unable to save three other plants - an assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio , and transmission plants in Warren, Michigan, and Baltimore, all which halted production earlier this year. And while thousands of workers at those plants have taken jobs at other GM plants, many are unhappy at having to relocate.

Tommy Wolikow used to work at GM's plant in Lordstown before relocating to work at a different GM plant in Flint, Michigan 250 miles away, leaving his family behind. He took the transfer hoping that this contract would force GM to shift more production from Mexico and reopen Lordstown. When he learned that wasn't included in tentative agreement, he said it was devastating.

""So many people left the community...with the thought in their mind that..our union is strong and our union's going to get us back to work in Lordstown one day, that this is just a brief thing that we got to do for our families,"" he said.

Without any production for Lordstown ""you know it's going to be a no vote for a lot of us,"" he said.

Tim O'Hara, president of the Lordstown union local, voted against the deal when it was presented to union leadership last week. Beyond the anger of Lordstown workers, he said strikers across the country are nervous about their jobs without an agreement from GM to bring work back from Mexico.

""You look on social media, you see a lot of people saying they don't like the terms,"" he said. ""It could go either way.""

Some of the workers are right to be nervous.

Two other GM assembly lines in Michigan are down to one shift per day, and could be at risk of closing during the four years of this proposed contract. Lordstown went from three shifts to a shutdown during the previous four-year deal. And despite the recent closings, GM's US plants still have excess capacity -- something that could be exacerbated if US sales continue to slow.

It was always unlikely that GM would agree to the union's demands that it shift production of any vehicles now being made in Mexico back to US plants, said Kristin Dziczek, the vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research.

""It cost billions of dollars to put them [in Mexico], and it'd cost billions of dollars to bring them back,"" said Dziczek. ""GM would have been loath to move anything back that they just spent money to put there.""

Only 55% of UAW members at GM approved the last deal , which was a much more positive contract for them: they received their first pay raises in more than a decade, and there were no plant closings or workers being relocated around the country.

It could be more difficult to complete the deal this time, given the anger directed at the company.

is its fear that the deal could be voted down. Four years ago, membership at Fiat Chrysler FCAU Ford F One reason the union may have postponed workers returning to workis its fear that the deal could be voted down. Four years ago, membership atrejected a tentative agreement, although they weren't on strike at the time. Membership atonly narrowly approved a deal that year as well.

If the GM strikers returned to work and then rejected a deal, it would be very hard for union negotiators to improve any terms at the bargaining table, said Dziczek.

""Once the strikers are back at work, [the negotiators] have no leverage,"" she said.

That members have been on strike since September 16 could cut both ways.

""The fact that they were out for five weeks, their expectations are higher,"" said Art Schwartz, a former GM labor negotiator who is now a consultant. ""But they want the ratification bonus. They have bills to pay. Both forces are at work.""

Schwartz wouldn't make a prediction on how this vote would go.

""It used to be a slam dunk,"" he said. ""But that seems to be changing."""

Warren has established herself as a fierce proponent of a single-payer health care system, but she has not gone as far as her ideological counterpart, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), in admitting that the plan will result in taxes going up for middle class Americans.

The presidential hopeful told a crowd at a town hall event in Indianola, Iowa, on Sunday that she will soon release an outline detailing the plan to fund the system, which by some estimates could cost over $60 trillion in the next decade.

“We need to talk about the cost, and I plan, over the next few weeks, to put out a plan that talks about specifically the cost of ‘Medicare for All’ and specifically how we pay for it,” Warren told the crowd.

“I think there have been many estimates about what the cost will be, and many different payment streams, and I’ve been working on how to give the exact details to make that work,” she told reporters:

Moderators – in more than one Democrat debate – have asked Warren if she would raise taxes on the middle class in order to pay for Medicare for All. Each time, the Massachusetts senator has offered notoriously evasive responses, talking about overall “cost” rather than directly explaining if taxes will go up for the middle class.

Moderators presented her with the same question during last week’s Democrat debate, and Warren went to her go-to talking point, arguing that overcall costs will go up for the “wealthy and big corporations” and go down for middle-class families.

That answer sparked criticism from Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who slammed Warren for repeatedly dodging the question.

“Well, you heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer,” he said.

“Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular,” he continued. “Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this.”

Warren would not budge in the spin room following the debate, telling the panel, “My commitment is I will not sign a bill into law that raises costs on middle class families.”

Sanders, on the other hand, has been very open about the cost of his plan. While he also believes that it is about overall “costs,” – arguing that middle class Americans will ultimately save money due to health care costs supposedly going down – he admitted last month that health care is not free.

“Now having said that, is health care free? No, it is not,” Sanders told late-night host Stephen Colbert last month. “So what we do is exempt the first $29,000 of a person’s income. You make less than $29,000, you pay nothing in taxes.”

“Above that, in a progressive way with the wealthiest people paying the largest percentage, people do pay more in taxes,” he continued. “But if I say to you, that right now you’re paying $20,000 a year in a tax called a premium for insurance companies. That’s gone.”"

The Federal Reserve has been pumping tens of billions of dollars into the market for overnight and short-term repurchase agreements, or repos, for several weeks. On Tuesday, the Fed swapped $99 billion of cash for securities held by banks.

In a letter addressed to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who chairs the Financial Stability Oversight Council, Warren asked the secretary to explain the causes of the market turmoil. She pointed out that many of the early attempts to explain the disruption–including large corporates tax payments due in mid-September–either never made much sense or fail to explain why the market continues to need so much additional liquidity.

“I am also concerned that, ‘Big U.S. banks are using the recent chaos short funding markets as an opportunity to pressure the Federal Reserve to ease liquidity requirements they l1ave long despised,'” Warren wrote, quoting from a Reuters report.

The Fed imposed new liquidity requirements after the financial crisis in an effort to avoid having to bail out banks in the future. Banks are supposed to have enough liquid assets, primarily cash and Treasury bonds, that they could sustain a short-term market disruption. Prior to the new regulations, many large financial institutions were often just days away from collapse if they could not obtain short-term funding.

Many on Wall Street now believe the liquidity regulations are playing a role in the problems with the short-term funding market, encouraging banks to “hoard liquidity” rather than lend it out. And, indeed, this is quickly becoming part of the case for reforming the liquidity requirements."

Thursday marked the first day of the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) strike, resulting in the cancellation of classes for the 361,000 K-12 students who attend Chicago Public Schools (CPS). The union and CPS have been unable to reach a negotiation on numerous issues, including salaries, benefits, and classroom size.

Warren is expected to join them as they go into their fourth day of the strike.

NBC Chicago reports:

According to a campaign email, the stop in Chicago will be part of a two-stop swing for the Democratic presidential candidate on Tuesday. Warren will join striking teachers in Chicago at a South Austin elementary school on the city’s West Side, picketing with teachers and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten.

Warren has made tangible efforts to position herself as one of the most outspoken pro-union 2020 candidates, joining airport food workers in a minimum wage protest at Reagan National Airport in July:

On Labor Day, Warren called for “stronger unions” and declared that unions will “rebuild America’s middle class.”

As for the CTU, negotiations are still underway, but progress, according to CTU President Jesse Sharkey, has halted. Sharkey accused Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration of “vindictive actions” and added that her recent letter “dashed our hopes of a quick settlement,” according to the Chicago Tribune.

According to the report:

Sharkey’s accusation came after Lightfoot and Chicago Public Schools CEO Janice Jackson made a plea to teachers to end their strike before a settlement and continue negotiations while working without a contract, leading Sharkey to say after negotiations ended for the day that Lightfoot’s letter had “dashed our hopes for a quick settlement.”

Sharkey said in an email that their bargaining team was “beginning to see glimmers of progress on issues that matter to our members” but added that progress “stopped dead” on Monday.

“It was clear from the mayor’s letter to the press demanding members go back to work without a contract and from the sudden atmosphere of stonewalling from the CPS team, that (Mayor Lori Lightfoot) had pulled the plug on negotiations,” Sharkey wrote, according to the Chicago Tribune.

“The mayor’s team said that there was no more money in the budget to address the many outstanding demands that are necessary to deliver justice for our school communities,” he added.

While Lightfoot and CPS CEO Janice Jackson have said that “real progress” was being made, both made it clear that the strikes are hurting students.

They wrote:

For the fourth straight school day, students from throughout the city won’t be participating in the athletic competitions they’ve earned the right to compete in, won’t be preparing their college applications with trusted school staff, and won’t be in classrooms with the teachers who hold the keys to their success.

“We must fix that immediately and end this strike,” they added."

While most national polls have shown a tight race between the former vice president and Sen. Elizabeth Warren in recent weeks – with Warren topping Biden in some cases – Morning Consult has consistently shown Biden leading the field.

The current results, taken Oct. 16-20, 2019, show Biden leading the field with 30 percent and Warren in second place with 21 percent. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) came in third with 18 percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), both of whom garnered six percent support each. Sen. Cory Booker (D), Beto O’Rourke (D), and Andrew Yang (D) garnered three percent, and the remaining candidates saw two percent support or less.

While there seems to be a disparity between the national polling results of Morning Consult and that of other polls, the trend remains the same. Morning Consult shows Biden on a slow decline – falling from a 40 percent high in May – and Warren rising, jumping from her seven percent low in March.

Notably, though, is Biden’s drop in favorability. The post-debate poll shows that Biden lost five favorability points following the last debate, dropping from 55 percent to 50 percent. Sanders’ remained the same with 57 percent, and Warren’s jumped by one point, from 52 percent to 53 percent.

Additionally, Warren remains the top second choice for Biden voters, with 28 percent choosing her and 26 percent choosing Sanders. The results are not necessarily reciprocated, as the Sanders holds a slight edge, earning the second choice support from 25 percent of Warren voters compared to Biden’s 24 percent.

The Massachusetts senator remains the top second choice candidate for supporters of Sanders, Harris, and Buttigieg.

The results of the survey are based on 11,521 interviews with registered voters “who indicate they may vote in the Democratic primary or caucus.” The margin of error is +/- 1 percent."

The New York lawmaker formally endorsed Sanders at a “Bernie’s Back Rally” in New York on Saturday, crediting him for helping her recognize her “inherent value as a human being who deserves health care, housing, education, and a living wage.” She echoed his vision to fundamentally transform the country and called for an America that is “multigeographic” and “multigendered.”

“Squad” member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) also offered her endorsement of Sanders, calling him the “only candidate who has built a movement.”

Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) has not formally issued an endorsement, but Sanders is expected to join the congresswoman for a tour of her district later this month.

The endorsements from key members of the far-left “Squad” sparked questions about their devotion to feminism and diversity. There is no shortage of women in the crowded Democrat field – Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), and Marianne Williamson (D) – yet they chose the oldest male candidate in the race.

Their decision sparked backlash and inspired a Vice article, which defended their decision from the critiques of “white feminists.” It is titled “Don’t Tell AOC, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib Their Bernie Endorsement Isn’t Feminist.”

“But it’s safe to assume ‘The Squad’ doesn’t need white feminists to help them understand which candidate best supports their feminist principles,” it reads in part.

Ocasio-Cortez said her decision to back Sanders over Warren had nothing to do with gender. Rather, she looked at the “feminist values in the campaign.”

“For me, this is not about ‘Why not any other candidate?'” Ocasio-Cortez said, according to NPR. “The fact that [Sanders] has been fighting for these issues for so long struck me in a very personal way.”

“One of the things that’s so important about what Senator Sanders is talking about, and what this campaign is about, is that it’s far larger than a presidential campaign,” Ocasio-Cortez told NPR, echoing Omar’s remarks. “This is about creating a mass movement.”

Warren did not make a big deal out of Ocasio-Cortez’s endorsement of her opponent, praising the freshman lawmaker for doing “terrific work.”

“I am a fan of the congresswoman. She’s done some terrific work. We have worked together, and I know that once this primary is over we’re all going to be on the same side,” Warren said.

Ocasio-Cortez echoed that sentiment during an interview with CBS This Morning alongside Sanders.

Rand Paul (R-KY) called rising support for socialism among youth in America “mind-boggling,” in a recent exclusive interview with Breitbart News on his new book The Case Against Socialism.

Paul, a 2016 Republican presidential candidate and prominent libertarian, said he remembers in the 1970s and 1980s when Americans would never admit to being socialists, let alone a liberal. Today, he said, Democrats are openly running on socialist platforms, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).

“It’s kind of mind-boggling, actually,” he said in an interview on Wednesday. “We now live in a time where not only are people talking about socialism, they’re proudly running as a socialist.”

“I think it’s important for this generation to realize what socialism was in the last century and how [it] really invariably was associated with violence, with genocide, with famine, with horrible tragedy and you know, today’s youth seems to have forgotten that,” he said.

He said in China, as many as 40 million died during the Great Famine in the late 1950s, and today, in Venezuela, people are eating their pets.

“That is the end result of socialism, there is no food in the stores,” he said. “Venezuela has more oil than any other country in the world, they have more oil than Saudi Arabia, they were one of the richest countries, and now they’re in calamitous poverty.”

His book tells the story of a young woman in Venezuela in a gang that controls territory — six dumpsters where they can search for food.

“How did they get there? It’s almost, it’s mind-boggling. How do you even explain it?” he said.

He said he does not think America is ready for socialism, but pointed out that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) — who does not call herself a socialist but is running on socialist policies — appears to be the Democrat frontrunner.

“The socialist doesn’t win, but the person who has all the same policies who doesn’t call herself a socialist, Elizabeth Warren, and right now is looking like the frontrunner, but she’s for most of the policies that Bernie Sanders is for and so that will be the question, will we elect someone with socialist policies?” he said.

Paul debunked the myth that there is socialism in Scandinavia.

“They’re not socialist in Scandinavia. They have private property, they have a private stock market, they don’t even have a minimum wage, prices go up and down, but they do have a big welfare state. So while they’re not socialist they have a big welfare state. They do have free college, free paid leave, all these sort of welfare goodies,” he said.

“It turns out in Scandinavia, the way they pay for free college and all this so-called free stuff is they tax the working class, and the middle class, extensively, so there’s a 25 percent sales tax, they call it a VAT, it’s on food, clothing, everything, you name it. Twenty-five percent so everybody pays that, including the poor. So that’s a pretty significant tax — 25 percent,” he said.

“They also have an income tax that’s 60 percent starting at $60,000. That’s way higher than the United States. So the dirty little secret of Scandinavia is you can have a welfare state but everybody’s got to pay taxes,” he said.

He said back in the U.S., Warren is promising Medicare-for-all without saying whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it.

“She won’t answer the question. Now Bernie has, he said we’ll raise taxes on the middle class but they’ll save money on their healthcare cause it’ll be ‘free,'” he said.

“Well Elizabeth Warren won’t answer that question, I think that’s going to be an important question for her, and we’ll see, and even the left and the establishment media and the left are going, ‘Elizabeth, how are you going to pay for this?’ and I think she’s boxed in a corner and eventually she’s going to have to admit — with massive middle class taxes.”

The new poll by Iowa Emerson College showed that only six percent of registered voters in Iowa said impeachment was their top issue. In comparison, 33 percent said the economy was the top issue, 19 percent said health care, and ten percent said social issues.

Even among just Democrats, 25 percent said health care was the most important issue, 17 percent said the economy, and 14 percent said the environment. Among Republicans, 55 percent said the economy was the most important issue, 14 percent said immigration. Among independents, 27 percent said the economy was the most important issue and 24 percent said health care.

In other words — impeachment is not within the top issues that Iowa voters care about. The Iowa poll also found a plurality of voters — 48 percent — oppose impeachment, versus 42 percent who support impeachment.

However, last week, three Democrat-led House committees held three separate closed-door hearings with current and former U.S. and State Department officials as part of House Democrats’ efforts to impeach Trump. And the fourth Democrat debate on Wednesday began with the issue of impeachment.

“The Democrats have some work to do in Iowa convincing voters that impeachment is a top priority of Congress; 67% of Democrats in Iowa support impeaching the president, but only 10% identify it as the most important issue in deciding their vote for president,” said Spencer Kimball, director of Emerson Polling.

A recent Axios focus group showed that nine out of 11 swing voters in Ohio said impeachment is a distraction from the issues they care most about, which are wages and unemployment, border security, bringing troops home, and health care costs and access.

With all but less than a dozen House Democrats supporting impeachment or an impeachment inquiry, it is considered increasingly inevitable. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has told Republican senators that he expects House Democrats will seek to impeach Trump. He has vowed in a campaign video he will stop it in the Senate.

The poll also showed that in a head-to-head matchup, Trump has a slight advantage over Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and former Vice President Joe Biden, 51 percent to 49 percent. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has a two-point advantage over Trump, 51 percent to 49 percent.

Among the Democrat candidates, Warren and Biden are tied at 23 percent, with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 16 percent, and Sanders fourth at 13 percent.

At issue in the case, Seila Law LLC v Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is (1) whether the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act’s:

…vesting of substantial executive authority in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent agency led by a single director, violates the separation of powers; and (2) whether, if the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is found unconstitutional on the basis of the separation of powers, [the portion of the Dodd-Frank Act that established the agency] can be severed from the [rest of that statute].

The powers and independence given to the director of the CFPB under the Dodd-Frank Act are extraordinary. Once appointed by the president to a five year term and confirmed by the Senate, the director cannot be fired by the president unless it is “for cause,” meaning that the director could not be removed for pursuing policies counter to the president’s agenda.

A ruling is expected by June of 2020, which could place the issue at the center of the presidential election. The agency was the brainchild of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who is currently either leading or tied with former Vice President Joe Biden in most national polls for the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination.

Amy Howe wrote on Friday at SCOTUSblog:

The dispute is not merely an academic one: If the justices agree that the restrictions violate the doctrine known as the separation of powers – the idea that the Constitution divides the different functions of government among the executive, judicial and legislative branches – their ruling could potentially unravel all the CFPB’s decisions in the nine years since its creation. The case now before the court was filed by Seila Law, a law firm that provides, according to its briefs, “a variety of legal services to consumers, including assistance with the resolution of consumer debt.” When the CFPB began an investigation into whether Seila had violated federal telemarketing laws, it sought information and documents from the firm. Seila objected to the request. It argued that the structure of the CFPB is unconstitutional because the bureau is headed by a single director, who has significant power but can only be removed by the president “for cause” – that is, for a very good reason. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit conceded that Seila’s argument was “not without force,” but it ultimately concluded that the Supreme Court’s cases point in the other direction. Although the director can only be removed for cause, the court of appeals reasoned, that restriction does not “impede the President’s ability to perform his constitutional duty to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed.”

The current director of the CFPB, Kathy Kraninger, has publicly stated that she believes it is unconstitutional that the president does not have the authority under the law to fire her or any future director without a specific cause.

Sen. Warren, for her part, vigorously argues that both the agency and the status of the director are constitutional. Should the Supreme Court rule against either of those components of the law, Warren is sure to make the ruling a big 2020 campaign issue.

Leftists have criticized the conduct of the CFPB since Richard Cordray, an Obama appointee, stepped down in November 2017 to run for governor of Ohio as the Democrat nominee, a race he lost in November 2018 to Republican Gov. Mike DeWine.

Cordray was replaced by current White House Chief of Staff and former OMB director Mick Mulvaney as acting director. Subsequently, President Trump nominated Mulvaney’s deputy director at OMB, Kathy Kraninger, to serve as director. Kraninger was confirmed by the Senate in December 2018.

Under Mulvaney and Kraninger, the controversial and overreaching enforcement actions undertaken by the CFPB under Cordray’s leadership have declined dramatically.

This is not the first challenge to the constitutionality of the CFPB that has come to the Supreme Court for consideration.

In January, the Supreme Court decided not to hear an appeal of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decision in the case of State National Bank of Big Spring v. Mnuchin

The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), one of the plaintiffs in the case, noted on its website that “[t]he lawsuit argued that the structure of the CFPB violates the Constitution’s separation of powers because the agency is insulated against meaningful checks by the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government.”

For example, unlike other agency heads, the CFPB’s director can only be fired by the president for specified causes. Normally, agency heads serve at the will of the president, an arrangement that makes an appointee more responsive and accountable to the president and, by extension, the American people. Also, unlike other regulatory agencies, Congress has no power to approve or disapprove the CFPB’s budget. Instead, the CFPB budget is taken from the budget of the Federal Reserve, which is the central banking system of the United States. That funding arrangement means the CFPB is not subject to Congress’s “power of the purse,” and it severely worsens the agency’s unaccountability. In effect, the CFPB functions like a fourth branch of government, unauthorized by the Constitution.

The lawsuit was filed in 2012, dismissed by a federal district judge in 2013, then appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and remanded back to the district court where, the CEI website added, “our case was put on hold by the district court pending the D.C. Circuit’s consideration of another court case, PHH Corp. v CFPB.”

In October 2016, a three-judge panel found the CFPB’s structure to be unconstitutional because its director could not be removed at will by the president. But on January 31, 2018, the en banc circuit court overturned the panel’s 2016 decision, effectively giving future heads of agencies like the CFPB enormous power with scant accountability. In the wake of this ruling, the district court in our case granted a joint motion for judgment against us in February, 2018. That ruling was summarily affirmed by the D.C. Circuit on June 8, 2018. We filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court on September 6, 2018, but our petition was subsequently denied on January 14, 2019.

“As a party in the first major challenge to the constitutionality of this agency, we are glad to see that this issue has now been taken up by the Supreme Court,” Sam Kazman, general counsel of the CEI said on Friday.

“We urge the Supreme Court to rule that the CFPB as structured is unconstitutional in order to help ensure government agencies are accountable to American consumers and voters,” CEI Senior Fellow John Berlau added.

“Under the leadership of current Director Kathleen Kraninger, the CFPB has made some positive, free-market reforms that greatly benefit consumers. But her good leadership doesn’t change our belief that the CFPB must be made constitutionally accountable by having a director subject to at-will removal by the person that Americans elect as their president,” Berlau concluded."

However, Democrats seemed to forget that their own House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) used similar terminology to describe the impeachment effort against former President Bill Clinton in 1998. At the time, he accused the GOP of “running a lynch mob.”

“I am the president’s defender in the sense that I haven’t seen anything yet that would rise, in my opinion, to the level of impeachable offense,” Nadler said at the time. “I wish we could get this over with quickly.”

“In pushing the process, in pushing the arguments of fairness and due process the Republicans so far have been running a lynch mob,” he added.

This is not the first time the terminology has been used to describe issues in the political realm. In 2015, CNN featured an op-ed titled, “Benghazi hearing: The high-tech lynching of Hillary Clinton.”

“And Then the Breitbart Lynch Mob Came for Me,” a 2017 piece from Foreign Policy reads.

In 2016, the Washington Post featured an op-ed titled, “Comey caves to a lynch-mob mentality,” which claimed that Republicans had become a “lynch mob.”

“Republicans had become a lynch mob, demanding frontier justice, and they howled in outrage when Comey refused to participate in the hanging, accusing him of unfairly rigging the election when all he had done was his job,” the piece reads, later assessing that conservatives “have succumbed to the same lynch-mob mentality that Comey caved to that now threatens the integrity of our electoral process.”"

“@Beyonce speaks the truth,” Clinton wrote as her caption alongside the hashtag #GutsyWomen — an homage to her latest children’s book.

Clinton’s comment was met with a load of backlash from commenters.

“Or in your case, buy it,” one user wrote.

“This seems to be contradicting the principles of democracy!” another reminded the failed Trump challenger.

“And you have stolen yours,” another commented. “Corruption is your power.”

However, there were also many users who praised Clinton for essentially courting Beyoncé’s fan base, which refers to itself as the “Beyhive.”

“Take that White House, Hillary!!” one wrote, with another adding, “I hope Beyoncé is the first woman president.”

The post also fueled speculation surrounding the possibility of a 2020 run, which Clinton has teased in recent weeks. Earlier this month, President Trump tweeted that “Crooked Hillary” should join the race “to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren” as long as she explains “all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting ‘C’ Subpoena!”

Clinton replied, “Don’t tempt me. Do your job.”

Her recent remarks on PBS NewsHour furthered speculation. Clinton told the outlet that she could “obviously” beat Trump “again.”

“Maybe there does need to be a rematch. I mean, obviously, I can beat him again,” she said. “But, just seriously, I don’t understand. I don’t think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.”

Political commentator and former Bill Clinton adviser Dick Morris said this week that there is a chance the former secretary of state will launch another presidential bid.

“I think it’s always possible that Hillary runs,” Morris said during an appearance on The Cats Roundtable on Sunday. “You know, John, there’s a test you can do at home. Just put your fingers on her wrist, and if you feel a pulse, you know she’s going to run.”

This is far from the first time Clinton has tried to use the Grammy-winning singer to boost her political and cultural status. Clinton made an appearance at Jay-Z’s “get-out-the-vote rally” in Cleveland, Ohio, in 2016, where Beyoncé delivered a passionate speech in support of the then-Democrat nominee.

“We have to vote. The world looks to us as a progressive country that leads change. Eight years ago, I was so inspired that my nephew, a young black child, could grow up knowing his dreams could be realized by witnessing a black president in office,” Beyoncé said. “And now, we have the opportunity to create more change. I want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country and know that her possibilities are limitless.”

“We have to think about the future of our daughters, of our sons, and vote for someone who cares for them as much as we do,” she added. “And that is why, ‘I’m with her.'”"

According to the op-ed:

Over 18 years, the United States has spent $4.9 trillion on wars, with only more intractable violence in the Middle East and beyond to show for it. That’s nearly the $300 billion per year over the current system that is estimated to cover Medicare for All (though estimates vary). While we can’t un-spend that $4.9 trillion, imagine if we could make different choices for the next 20 years. We’ve identified more than $300 billion in annual military savings alone that we could better invest in priorities like Medicare for All, working with a national grassroots movement called Poor People’s Campaign.

While estimates tend to vary, one from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University assessed that the government-run healthcare system would cost $32 trillion over the next decade alone and would require massive tax increases. It would ultimately result in a “transformative change in the size of the federal government,” according to the study’s author Charles Blahous.

As Breitbart News reported:

Blahous argues that the estimates for the $32 trillion price tag are relatively conservative because they assume that Sanders’ bill achieves its goals of reducing payments to health providers, as well as lowering drug prices and administrative costs. The Mercatus Center suggested that doubling federal individual and corporate income tax would not cover the costs of the “Medicare for all” plan.

However, Blahous later testified before the House Rules Committee’s hearing on Medicare for All and said the federal government’s total spending on a government-run healthcare system could top $60 trillion over the next decade.

As Breitbart News reported:

Blahous said that the $32 trillion price tag was too conservative and that given historical spending levels on health care, net new federal spending would likely increase spending by $38.8 trillion over the next ten years and would increase federal healthcare spending to 13 to 15 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The Mercatus scholar also noted that the Medicare for All’s total federal spending price over the next ten years would amount to between $54.6 trillion and $60.7 trillion. Blahous mentioned that “doubling individual and corporate income taxes would be insufficient to finance even the lower bound” of the $32.6 trillion in new federal spending.

Most Americans, 64 percent, are opposed to paying more in taxes to implement Medicare for All, according to a Locust Street Group released in August.

Omar’s position follows her endorsement of socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who remains a fierce proponent of a single-payer system. Sanders has been extremely forthcoming on how he would pay for the implementation of the multi-trillion dollar proposal, openly admitting that taxes will go up for middle class Americans but arguing that overall “cost” will go down as premiums are erased. The latter is an argument Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has made repeatedly, but she has yet to explicitly say if she would raise taxes on middle class Americans to pay for Medicare for All.

“What our bill does … what people should understand is that what Medicare for All does is eliminates your private health insurance premiums. You’re not going to be paying that, you’re not going to be paying co-payments, you’re not going to be paying deductibles,’ Sanders told Iowa CBS affiliate KCCI in May.

“You’re going to be seeing your prescription drug cost, in my view, come down by 50 percent. Will you be paying more in taxes? Yes, you will,” he added.

Cost, however, is not the only concern. Opponents of Medicare for All also point to bureaucratic mismanagement and argue that a government-run healthcare system will result in a sharp decline in overall quality of care."

Over 184 House Republicans, or 93 percent, have cosponsored House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs’ (R-AZ) H. Res. 604, according to a list obtained by Breitbart News. H. Res. 604 would condemn Schiff for reading a fictional phone call between Zelensky and Trump into the record.

Schiff also allegedly lied about having never spoken to the Ukrainian intelligence officer “whistleblower.”

Rep. Biggs wanted to force a vote on the legislation this week but delayed the move after House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-MD) passed away. The Arizona conservative will reportedly force the vote Monday night.

The legislation to condemn Rep. Schiff has quickly gained support from House GOP across the political spectrum. House Freedom Caucus conservatives, moderates, and House Republican leadership have all cosponsored the legislation.

Since Biggs introduced the legislation in late September, the bill quickly gained 18 cosponsors. Now, the bill features support from 93 percent of the House Republican Conference.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), and House Republican Conference chairwoman Liz Cheney (R-WY) have sponsored the resolution to condemn Schiff.

Biden has the support of 34% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters, his best showing in CNN polling since just after his campaign's formal launch on April 25.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont are about even for second, with 19% and 16%, respectively. Behind them, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris of California each have 6% support, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke each at 3%.

Biden's rise comes largely from a consolidation of support among his core backers, and doesn't appear to harm any individual opponent. Warren and Sanders hold about even with their standing in the last CNN poll in September, and no other candidate has seen a shift of more than 2 points in that time.

But Biden has seen big spikes in support among moderate and conservative Democrats (43% support him now, up from 29% in the September poll), racial and ethnic minorities (from 28% among all nonwhites in September to 42% now) and older voters (up 13 points since September among those 45 and older) that outpace those among younger potential Democratic voters (up 5 points among those younger than 45).

The gains come as Biden's time as vice president is put under the spotlight by President Donald Trump and his allies. Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry by the House of Representatives over allegations that he pressured the Ukrainian government to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, as well as the 2016 US election in return for releasing hundreds of millions in congressionally mandated defense funding meant for Ukraine. Hunter Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while Biden was vice president. There is no evidence that either Biden did anything wrong in Ukraine.

The poll suggests that although Biden's October debate performance did not blow away the audience (15% who watched or followed news about it said he had done the best job in the debate, well behind Warren's 28% -- but better than most on the stage), the arguments he made on health care, foreign policy and the economy may have boosted his standing with the potential Democratic electorate.

Asked which candidate would best handle a range of top issues, Biden leads the way on four of the six issues tested in the poll. He holds a massive edge over the field on foreign policy (56% say he would handle it best, well ahead of Sanders at 13% and Warren at 11%), and tops the next closest candidate by nearly 20 points on the economy (38% Biden, 19% Sanders, 16% Warren). Biden also outpaces the rest of the field as most trusted on immigration (29% Biden, 16% each Warren and Sanders) and gun policy (27% vs. 13% Sanders and 11% Warren, with O'Rourke close at 9%).

Biden doesn't hold a significant edge on the critical issue of health care (31% Biden, 28% Sanders, 17% Warren) but he's surged 13 points on the issue since June, when he lagged behind Sanders. Neither Sanders' nor Warren's numbers on the issue have moved significantly in that time.

And Biden now runs even with Sanders at 26% as best able to handle the climate crisis. Warren is at 18% on that issue. The results mark increases for Biden and Sanders, who were each at 19% on handling the climate in June.

The former vice president's advantages on the issues come as he emphasizes an approach that appears to align with the preferences of most potential Democratic voters. A 53% majority say they want the nominee to advocate policies that have a good chance of becoming law, even if the changes aren't as big, vs. 42% who prefer advocating big changes even if they have less of a chance of becoming law.

Among those voters who prefer an approach that prioritizes policies with a better chance of becoming law, 38% support Biden for the Democratic nomination, 17% Warren and just 8% Sanders. On the other side, it's nearly a three-way split, with 27% behind Biden, 24% Sanders and 21% Warren.

About 1 in 5 potential Democratic voters say they watched last week's debate among 12 Democratic candidates, and those who watched it came away with a different assessment than those who mainly followed news about the debate. Overall, among everyone who either watched or followed news coverage on the debate, 28% say Warren had the best night, 15% Biden, 13% Sanders, 11% Buttigieg, 4% Klobuchar and 2% Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, with the rest at 1% or less. Among those who say they watched it, though, Warren remains on top at 29%, but 21% say Buttigieg had the best night, then 13% Biden, 11% Sanders, 10% Klobuchar and 4% Booker, with everyone else at 1% or less.

And those who watched the debate seem to have more favorable views of the lesser-known candidates who were seen as having good nights than do those who followed coverage. Among debate watchers, 74% have a favorable view of Buttigieg, vs. 54% among those who followed news instead. Booker's favorability rating is 80% among those who watched, vs. 55% among those who followed coverage, and Klobuchar's favorability stands at 56% among watchers vs. 36% among those who followed news.

Warren tops the list of candidates who potential Democratic voters say they want to hear more about: 31% name her, 24% Buttigieg, 23% Harris, 18% Booker, 17% Sanders, 16% Biden, 13% Klobuchar, 11% O'Rourke and 10% businessman Andrew Yang.

Majorities of potential Democratic voters say they would at least be satisfied with any of the top three becoming the party's nominee, with about 4 in 10 saying they'd be enthusiastic about Biden (43%), Warren (41%) or Sanders (39%). Fewer would feel as excited should Buttigieg become the party's nominee (27% enthusiastic).

Registered voters generally give Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg large advantages over President Donald Trump in hypothetical general election matchups. Biden leads the President by 10 points, 53% to 43%, with Sanders up 9 (52% to 43%) and Warren up 8 (52% to 44%). Buttigieg holds a 6-point edge, 50% to 44%.

The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS from October 17 through 20 among a random national sample of 1,003 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer, including 424 registered voters who are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. For results among potential Democratic voters, it is plus or minus 5.8 points."

(CNN) As the Republic of Venice slowly slid into the 18th century, its economic power was waning while military threats piled up all around it. Inside the city, though, it maintained a vibrant cultural and political life.

When its elites, visiting nobility, and the lower status citizens of the city wanted to mingle, they all would put on masks. Far from the elaborate contraptions sold on every corner in the touristy city, mostly these masks didn't do much to conceal identity. Instead, they provided a polite fiction that allowed people to cross social lines without threatening social norms. Early modern Venetians had masks; today, politicians have Twitter.

Last week, Sen. Mitt Romney told The Atlantic writer McKay Coppins that he had a secret Twitter account , offering just enough details that Ashley Feinberg, who writes for Slate, could deduce its identity . Feinberg reasoned that Romney would want to follow his family members, including his grandchildren, some of whom have relatively few followers. Feinberg introduced us to Twitter user @qaws9876 , aka Pierre Delecto. When Coppins confronted Romney with the deduction, the senator replied only, ""C'est moi"" (or ""it's me,"" in French).

The revelations about Romney's activity on Twitter come at a curious time for the ""sometimes Trump"" Republican caucus, whose ranks include Romney. These Republicans, who include both lawmakers and writers , took principled positions against the president when he was running for the GOP nomination, mostly backed him against Clinton or suggested they might futilely write-in another option.

Since Trump's election, they have oscillated back and forth from quiescent subjugation to periodic public complaint about presidential conduct. These complaints never seem to result in Republicans organizing against Trump from within. Only rarely has this cohort voted against Trump's norms in Congress ( with a few notable exceptions ) and never have they publicly campaigned for Democrats. In fact, as Elizabeth Warren seems to have emerged as at least a co-frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, most ""Sometimes Trump"" writers seem to be setting themselves up to reluctantly support the president

But now with Trump and his cronies — both staff like Mick Mulvaney and on-again off-again personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani — almost daily confessing to transgressions, it's both easier for Republicans like Romney to stand against the president and harder for him to stay quiet.

Twitter is a performative space, at least if you have a public account. Whereas Facebook has sophisticated layering of privacy options — often bewildering to the casual user — that encourage participation within closed, selected, networks of mutual connections, Twitter promotes the short, loud blast. It's a place that works very well for sharing news and for making like-minded connections. Its public nature also comes with the serious risk of harassment and bullying.

His mask had come off, but he hadn't used this private account to do anything especially significant. Pierre Delecto only tweeted 10 times. Feinberg noted that a number of responses were aimed at journalists directly criticizing Romney and other Republicans for a lack of spine in the face of Trump's flagrant misconduct. Wait and see, Romney seemed to suggest, but there's nothing revelatory here. We've been waiting to see for a long time.

I'm a historian of pre-modern Venice and often think about the efforts that medieval democracy undertook to maintain social order, protect their electoral systems, and thrive in a fraught space between different spheres of power (Rome, the Holy Roman Empire, Byzantium and then the Ottomans, Catholics versus Protestants, and more over the centuries).

Their masks have enhanced a reputation for secrecy and debauchery, that ""anything goes"" once the masks are on. In the recent book, ""Venice Incognito,"" though, historian James Johnson argues that masks were in many cases a tool of the status quo, ""permitting contact among unequals through fictive concealment. Rather than obscuring identities, masks affirmed their permanence."" The donning of a mask created a fiction that affirmed social structures, rather than threatening them.

Mitt Romney and a handful of other Republican leaders have a chance to act. But they are going to have do so without masks and, most critically, they are going to have to risk upsetting their own delicate position. Romney and the rest will have to stop performing principled resistance and actually resist. Trump will eventually be gone, but for America to move past this difficult moment, all the masks must come off."
726,"Nima Elbagir, Florence Davey-Attlee and Jack Guy, CNN",,US Sen. Elizabeth Warren has written to US government agencies demanding answers after a CNN investigation revealed that American-made weapons in Yemen are being turned on the internationally recognized and US-backed government.,2019-10-23,CNN,Elizabeth Warren demands answers from US government after CNN's Yemen investigation,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/23/politics/elizabeth-warren-letter-yemen-cnn-investigation-intl/index.html,"(CNN) US Sen. Elizabeth Warren has written to US government agencies demanding answers after a CNN investigation revealed that American-made weapons in Yemen are being turned on the internationally recognized and US-backed government.

Last week, CNN revealed that military hardware supplied to US allies had been distributed in contravention of arms deals to militia groups, including separatists backed by the United Arab Emirates. The separatists are now using that hardware to fight the Saudi Arabia-supported forces of the internationally recognized government, who are also armed with US weapons.

""These unauthorized diversions of American military hardware to armed groups ... undermine US national security objectives in securing a political settlement to the conflict in Yemen, which has no military solution and remains one of the world's worst humanitarian crises,"" reads Warren's letter, which was sent Monday and is addressed to US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

This is the second time that Warren, a candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, has written to the US agencies about arms transfers in Yemen following CNN reporting.

In February, a CNN investigation revealed that Saudi Arabia and the UAE had transferred American-made weapons to al Qaeda-linked fighters, hardline Salafi militias, and other factions waging war in Yemen, in violation of their agreements with the United States.

The weapons also made their way into the hands of Iranian-backed rebels battling the coalition for control of the country, exposing some of America's sensitive military technology to Tehran and potentially endangering the lives of US troops in other conflict zones.

Responding to the latest evidence published by CNN last week, a UAE official said: ""There were no instances when US-made equipment was used without direct UAE oversight. Except for four vehicles that were captured by the enemy."" The Saudi government has not responded to CNN's requests for comment on this issue.

Warren sent the agencies detailed questions about the supervision of US-made weapons but received no reply other than a ""brief acknowledgment from the State Department,"" according to her letter.

""The latest report underscores the need for concrete answers to my initial inquiry, highlights the importance of preventing unauthorized access, unauthorized transfers, or other violations of end-user agreements by foreign governments, and raises legitimate questions about whether it is in America's interest to continue selling arms and other military hardware to the Saudi and UAE governments,"" wrote Warren.

CNN has reached out to the State Department and Pentagon for comment on Warren's letter.

Following CNN's initial reporting in February, the Pentagon said it had launched its own investigation into the unauthorized transfer of US weapons in Yemen. In response to CNN's new findings, Pentagon spokesperson Lt. Col. Carla Gleason said in September that the joint investigation by the State Department and Department of Defense remains ""ongoing.""

But more than half a year since the investigation was launched, the situation on the ground appears to have gotten worse.

Saudi Arabia has led a coalition, in close partnership with the UAE and including various militia groups, to fight the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen since 2015. But, in a clear break with its Saudi partners, the UAE said in July that it was reducing its forces in the country, and fighting escalated between separatists and government forces on the ground in August. The UAE has since thrown its support behind the separatist movement.

In recent months there have been multiple efforts by US lawmakers to force President Donald Trump to end US financial and military backing for the war in Yemen.

Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat, authored an amendment to the annual US defense spending bill, which is currently being debated in Washington, that would cut off support for the Saudi-led coalition until the Secretary of Defense can certify that both the Saudis and Emiratis have stopped transferring US weapons to third parties in Yemen.

In June 2019 the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) reported that the total number of reported fatalities in Yemen is more than 91,000 since 2015."

Elizabeth Warren's silence on how she plans to pay for Medicare for All has turned into a problem at an important moment in her campaign. Right as she has become one of the clear frontrunners in the Democratic race — if not the frontrunner — she walked out of the fourth Democratic debate a bit bruised from her unwillingness to answer the question about whether she would raise taxes to pay for the benefits.

Warren has promised to release her plan about paying for the benefits. ""Right now the cost estimates for Medicare for All vary by trillions and trillions of dollars and the different revenue stream for how to fund it, there are a lot of it,"" she said in Iowa . ""This is something I've been working on for months and months, and it's got just a little more work until it's finished.""

The plan will likely involve a package that mixes higher taxes and other revenue streams in exchange for eliminating the deductibles and premiums as well as other out-of-pocket expenses. Warren might make some adjustments to proposed benefits to lower the high estimates that are currently being projected.

But to take control of this debate, Warren needs to offer more than a policy brief about finance. She has the chance to turn this challenge into an opportunity to make this part of her signature issue — restoring security to middle class Americans. It's an issue that has gotten drowned out with all the emphasis on health care.

During the televised debates, the conversation about paying for Medicare for All has overwhelmed almost every other domestic issue. The good news for her and other proponents of this idea is that although polls show that 55% of Democrats would prefer to build on the existing Affordable Care Act, 51% of all Americans support a Medicare for All approach — a good sign of the potential to win votes across the aisle.

728,"Matt Egan, CNN Business",,Elizabeth Warren fears Wall Street will use the recent mayhem in overnight lending markets to convince Washington to relax regulations aimed at preventing a repeat of the 2008 crisis.,2019-10-22,CNN,Elizabeth Warren is alarmed about turmoil in overnight lending markets,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/22/business/elizabeth-warren-overnight-lending-regulation/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Elizabeth Warren fears Wall Street will use the recent mayhem in overnight lending markets to convince Washington to relax regulations aimed at preventing a repeat of the 2008 crisis.

Warren, the Democratic presidential candidate, wrote a letter on Friday to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin saying she is ""alarmed"" by last month's spike in overnight lending rates.

These rules were designed to ensure that banks have enough cash on hand to meet their obligations in the event of another market crash.""

The September cash crunch in a critical corner of finance forced the New York Federal Reserve to come to the rescue for the first time in a decade.

The precise cause of the market stress is unclear. However, bankers and some analysts have said that post-crisis rules may be at fault, because they limit the ability of banks to provide cash to short-term borrowers when it's needed.

Warren, a strong proponent of tough regulation on Wall Street, doesn't buy that argument.

""Banks are reporting profits at record levels,"" Warren wrote in a letter her office released on Tuesday, ""and it would be painfully ironic if unexplained chaos in a small corner of the banking market became an excuse to further loosen rules that protect the economy from these types of risks.""

For instance, big banks must comply with the liquidity coverage ratio, or LCR, which requires them to keep a large amount of easily tradeable assets on their balance sheets. The goal is to avoid a repeat of 2008, when banks were sitting on toxic mortgage assets they couldn't unload when they needed the cash.

Warren urged Mnuchin, who serves as chairman of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, to answer a series of questions by November 1 about the causes of the overnight market turmoil and what regulators are doing to prevent the disruption from impacting the real economy.

Emergency cash injections

The inquiry underscores the lingering mystery over the market stress more than a month after it first emerged. Although borrowing rates have tumbled back to normal levels, there are still signs of strain.

The overnight lending market plays a crucial role in modern finance. This market allows banks, hedge funds and other institutions to quickly and easily borrow money.

On September 17, the rate on overnight repurchase agreements, or repos, soared as high as 10%. That's well above the target range of about 2% for short-term borrowing set by the Federal Reserve. The episode suggested that the plumbing in the financial system was broken.

The NY Fed stepped in with a series of emergency cash injections aimed at easing the market stress. The rescues successfully drove rates back down.

Initially, the Fed pinned the blame on two one-off factors: The withdrawal of cash by US companies to make quarterly tax payments to the Treasury Department, and the settlement of a large amount of Treasury purchases. But both factors should have been anticipated by investors, and the market pressure continued even after those events subsided.

In fact, there was such strong demand for the NY Fed's repo operations that it suggested the central bank's continued support is needed. Banks and other financial institutions were still clamoring for cash.

Earlier this month, the Fed announced a new program aimed at easing the liquidity squeeze. The central bank said it will purchase up to $60 billion of Treasury bills per month. The move will boost the size of the Fed's balance sheet, reversing recent efforts to shrink it. The reversal suggests the Fed underestimated how much cash is needed to keep the system running smoothly.

The Fed stressed that unlike the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, this round of bond buying is not designed to boost sluggish economic growth. It's squarely focused on fixing the problem in the overnight lending market.

'We'd have been happy to'

Some analysts and industry officials argued that the overnight lending problems show the unintended consequences of post-crisis rules, such as the liquidity requirements.

Almost immediately, the Bank Policy Institute, a bank lobbying organization, wrote a blog post urging regulators to rethink liquidity requirements.

JPMorgan Chase JPM EvenCEO Jamie Dimon chimed in. During a conference call last week, Dimon said JPMorgan had the cash required to soothe the overnight lending markets -- but its hands were tied by regulations.

""We could not redeploy it into the repo market, which we'd have been happy to do,"" Dimon said. ""And I think it's up to the regulators to decide they want to recalibrate the kind of liquidity they expect us to keep.""

Philip Marey, senior US strategist at Rabobank, agrees that regulation is playing a role.""Due to post-crisis regulation, banks are no longer taking the risks necessary to keep the plumbing of the financial system open in times of stress,"" he wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.

Warren expressed concern that regulators ""might support"" efforts to dial back post-crisis regulations in response to the market turbulence.

""These rules were designed to ensure that banks have enough cash on hand to meet their obligations in the event of another market crash,"" she wrote.

$99.9 billion pumped in on Tuesday alone

No matter the cause, there are still clear signs of pressure in the short-term borrowing markets.

The NY Fed pumped in $99.9 billion of cash into the financial system on Tuesday alone. That included $64.9 billion of overnight repurchase agreements as well as a $35 billion operation that doesn't expire until November 5.

In addition to that short-term liquidity, the Fed injected $7.5 billion into the market through Treasury bill purchases. Banks tried to secure $41.5 billion of funding from the Fed, meaning the operation was five-and-a-half times oversubscribed. In other words, banks are still clamoring for cash.

And US fixed income strategists at JPMorgan are warning that the funding stress is likely to intensify towards the end of the year, when seasonal stress normally emerges.

""This is all likely to get much worse, in our view, before it gets better,"" the JPMorgan analysts wrote."

His press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, later tweeted , ""I hope we see honest reporting from today's mtg.""

We can honestly tell you that Trump's remarks were highly dishonest.

We're still looking into some of the President's claims. We can report that at least 21 of them were false:

Barack Obama and Kim Jong Un

""But in the meantime, North Korea, I like Kim, he likes me. We get along. I respect him, he respects me. 'You could end up in a war.' President Obama told me that. He said, 'The biggest problem, I don't know how to solve it.' He told me he doesn't know how to solve it. I said, 'Did you ever call him?' 'No.' Actually, he tried 11 times. But the man on the other side, the gentleman on the other side, did not take his call. OK? Lack of respect. But he takes my call,'"" Trump said.

Facts First: There is no apparent basis for the claim that Obama tried to call Kim Jong Un 11 times.

""This is a total fabrication. Trump is completely delusional, and it's scary,"" Susan Rice, who served as Obama's national security adviser, said on Twitter in response to our tweet of Trump's quote.

""We never called Kim,"" Ben Rhodes, who served as Obama's deputy national security adviser, told CNN.

Trump has previously claimed that Obama begged Kim for a meeting, another assertion for which there is no evidence.

The Iraq War

""If you remember, I didn't want to go into Iraq. I was a civilian, so I had no power over it. But I always was speaking against going into Iraq,"" Trump said.

Facts First: Trump did not publicly oppose the invasion of Iraq before it began. Trump was tentatively supportive of the war when radio host Howard Stern asked him in September 2002, ""Are you for invading Iraq?"" He : Trump did not publicly oppose the invasion of Iraq before it began. Trump was tentatively supportive of the war when radio host Howard Stern asked him in September 2002, ""Are you for invading Iraq?"" He responded : ""Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly."" The day after the invasion in March 2003, he said , ""It looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint."" Trump did not offer a definitive position on the looming war in a Fox News interview in January 2003, saying, ""Either you attack or don't attack.""

Trump started publicly questioning the war later in 2003, and he was an explicit opponent in an Esquire article published 17 months after the invasion. That is not the same as ""I was against going to the war.""

The presidential salary

""But I give away my presidential salary. They say that no other president has done it. I'm surprised, to be honest with you. They actually say that George Washington may have been the only other president,"" Trump said.

Facts First: Trump does : Trump does donate his salary, but the rest of his claim was inaccurate. He is not the only president to have donated the official salary; both John F. Kennedy and Herbert Hoover did so. Washington did not.

Although Washington initially declined his salary, he relented after Congress insisted.

George Washington's ""two desks""

Trump said ""George Washington, he ran his business simultaneously"" as he was president, adding, ""George Washington, they say, had two desks. He had a presidential desk and a business desk."" He gestured as if pointing to two desks sitting side by side.

Facts First: Washington, a major landowner, did continue to own property while serving as president, and he took an Washington, a major landowner, did continue to own property while serving as president, and he took an interest in his farm at Mount Vernon while in office -- even writing to a United Kingdom official to discuss getting help finding renters for Mount Vernon land. But historians say Trump's claim about Washington having a separate desk for business work is baseless.

When asked about the claim Washington had two desks, Joseph Ellis , a Pulitzer-prize winning historian and author of the book ""His Excellency: George Washington,"" told CNN, ""I don't know what he's talking about.""

Jeremi Suri, a history professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said ""Trump's statement is utter nonsense.

""It's an absurd allegation, basically,"" said Elizabeth Cobbs, a history professor at Texas A&M University and senior fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution. ""Certainly, every one of the founders had personal property that they maintained while they were in office. Whether they kept their materials in a separate desk or not is irrelevant.""

Mary Thompson, a research historian for Mount Vernon, Washington's home, told CNN that while there were two desks associated with Washington's presidency -- his presidential desk and one at Mount Vernon made for Washington after his term as president -- they did not exist together or side by side as Trump implied.

""I am not aware of Washington having had two desks in the study in the presidential mansion, which was a fairly small room,"" Thompson said.

Ellis noted that while Washington's correspondence during his presidency suggested he wanted to be at Mount Vernon, ""it wasn't because he had business back there but because that was his home, the place where he was felt most comfortable.""

""He didn't own a corporation or anything. He did have some land out in the west in what is now West Virginia, western Pennsylvania and Ohio, and he was trying to manage that,"" Ellis said.

The Emoluments Clause

Trump attacked critics who said that holding a G7 summit at one of his resorts would violate the Constitution. He said: ""You people with this phony Emoluments Clause.""

Facts First: There's nothing phony about the Constitution's prohibitions against the President receiving payments from foreign and domestic governments.

The clause on foreign emoluments, found in Article I, Section 9, says that ""no person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state.""

The clause on domestic emoluments, found in Article II, Section 1, says: ""The President shall, at stated times, receive for his services, a compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States, or any of them.""

Trump might have been attempting to argue that it is phony to apply the clause to his own activities, but, at very least, his wording left an inaccurate impression.

The deal with Turkey

""People have been trying to make this deal for years,"" Trump said of his ceasefire agreement with Turkey.

Facts First: The President's claim is baseless to the point of being nonsensical. The deal is a narrow agreement specifically tied to the Turkish offensive that followed Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from a Kurdish-held region of northern Syria, not an agreement that resolves long-standing regional disputes. Further, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush never sought to give Turkey anything like the concessionary terms of Trump's deal.

The Ukraine scandal

The whistleblower's account

""The whistleblower gave a false account,"" Trump said. He also said the whistleblower's account was ""totally false.""

Facts First: The whistleblower's account of Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was largely accurate. In fact, the rough transcript released by Trump himself showed that the whistleblower's three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct.

You can read a longer fact check here

The whistleblower's knowledge

""The whistleblower had second- and third-hand information. You remember that, it was a big problem,"" Trump said.

Facts First: Some of the whistleblower's information came from others, but some did not. Michael Atkinson, the Trump-appointed inspector general for the intelligence community, : Some of the whistleblower's information came from others, but some did not. Michael Atkinson, the Trump-appointed inspector general for the intelligence community, noted that the whistleblower had ""direct knowledge of certain alleged conduct.""

Atkinson also explained that the whistleblower was ""credible"" even about events on which the whistleblower did not have firsthand knowledge, such as the call: ""... although the Complainant's Letter acknowledged that the Complainant was not a direct witness to the President's July 25, 2019, telephone call with the Ukrainian President, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community determined that other information obtained during the ICIG's preliminary review supported the Complainant's allegations.""

The call document

Trump said, ""... I released a transcription then by stenographers of the exact conversation I had.""

Facts First: The document released by the White House explicitly : The document released by the White House explicitly says , on the first page, that it is not an exact transcript of the call.

""A Memorandum of a Telephone Conversation (TELCON) is not a verbatim transcript of a discussion. The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place. A number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record, including poor telecommunications connections and variations in accent and/or interpretation,"" the document says.

The whistleblower being 'gone'

""You never hear, what happened to the whistleblower? They're gone, because they've been discredited,"" Trump said.

Facts First: There is no evidence that either the first whistleblower (who filed the complaint about Trump's dealings with Ukraine) or the second whistleblower (whose lawyers say they have firsthand information corroborating claims made by the first whistleblower) are now somehow ""gone,"" let alone that they are ""gone"" because the first whistleblower was shown to be inaccurate.

""The whistleblowers have not vanished,"" Bradley Moss, a colleague of Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the two whistleblowers, said on Twitter.

The whistleblower and Adam Schiff

Trump said, ""So was there actually an informant? Maybe the informant was Schiff. It could be shifty Schiff. In my opinion it's possibly Schiff.""

Facts First: This is nonsensical. Schiff, a Democratic congressman and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, did not have access to the internal White House information the whistleblower revealed; he could not have told the whistleblower about the contents of Trump's phone call with Zelensky or other information the whistleblower reported. The whistleblower : This is nonsensical. Schiff, a Democratic congressman and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, did not have access to the internal White House information the whistleblower revealed; he could not have told the whistleblower about the contents of Trump's phone call with Zelensky or other information the whistleblower reported. The whistleblower said information about the call came from ""multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call.""

Schiff's comments

Trump said of the comments Schiff made about the Zelensky call at a committee hearing: ""So he made up a lie, and I released -- they never thought that I'd do this -- I released a transcription done by stenographers of the exact conversation I had. And now the game was up.""

Facts First: Schiff made his comments about Trump's call after the President released the rough transcript, not before. The White House issued the document on September 25. Schiff spoke at a House Intelligence Committee hearing on September 26.

The crowd in Dallas

""I had 25,000 people, close, in that arena,"" Trump said of his rally last week in Dallas.

Facts First: The American Airlines Center has a capacity of about 20,000. The El Paso Times : The American Airlines Center has a capacity of about 20,000. The El Paso Times reported a crowd of 18,500.

Trump paused mid-speech to ask the fire marshal to let more people in to fill empty space at floor level.

The crowd outside

Trump claimed that about ""at least"" 20,000 supporters were outside the arena during his Dallas rally.

Facts First: Trump's estimate was way off, though it was lower than the ""close to 30,000"" he had claimed during the speech. ""We didn't have 30K outside. Probably had upward of 5K outside,"" Dallas Police Department spokesman Sgt. Mitchell Warren told CNN in response to that previous Trump estimate.

Rally crowds

""I haven't had an empty seat at a rally,"" Trump said.

Facts First: There have been empty seats at various Trump rallies, including a : There have been empty seats at various Trump rallies, including a rally earlier this month in Minneapolis, a July rally in Greenville, North Carolina, an October 2018 rally in Houston and an April 2017 rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, according to journalists on the scene.

China's economic performance

A week after correctly saying that this is China's worst year for gross domestic product growth in ""27 years,"" Trump said it is China's worst year in ""57 years"": ""China is doing very poorly. Worst year they've had in 57 years. I wonder why. I wonder why. I'm sure you can't figure it out.""

Facts First: China's second-quarter GDP growth of 6.2% and third-quarter GDP growth of 6% were its : China's second-quarter GDP growth of 6.2% and third-quarter GDP growth of 6% were its worst since 1992 , 27 years ago.

While China's official figures are generally considered unreliable, there is no apparent basis for the ""57 years"" figure. (Trump has made clear that he knows that this is the reported figure, but he has repeatedly added additional years for no apparent reason.)

Who is paying the tariffs on China

Trump said the US is ""taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China, and they're eating the tariffs.""

Facts First: Americans make the actual tariff payments, and a : Americans make the actual tariff payments, and a bevy of economic studies has found that Americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs.

The length of the Syria mission

Trump said American troops were initially supposed to be in Syria for a mere ""30 days.""

Facts First: There was never any specific timeline for the US military's involvement in Syria, much less a timeline of only 30 days.

""There was never a 30-day timetable on the US presence in Syria,"" said Syria expert Steven Heydemann, a professor of government and director of the Middle East Studies program at Smith College. ""The previous administration, and officials serving in this administration, have never offered a fixed timetable for the US mission. Official statements have emphasized that the presence of US forces would be short, limited in scope, and small. But beyond general comments along those lines, there has been no statement indicating it would end after 30 days.""

The troops being withdrawn from Syria

""We're bringing our troops back home. I got elected on bringing our soldiers back home,"" Trump said.

Facts First: He is not bringing the troops back home, at least not at the moment.

Trump has announced that ""United States troops coming out of Syria will now redeploy and remain in the region to monitor the situation and prevent a repeat of 2014, when the neglected threat of ISIS raged across Syria and Iraq."" He has also announced that 1,800 more troops would be deployed to Saudi Arabia.

Trump conceded at the Cabinet meeting that the soldiers will be ""sent, initially, to different parts,"" but he claimed that they would ""ultimately"" return to the US.

The size of Miami International Airport

Touting the benefits of his Doral resort, Trump said it is right next to Miami International Airport, ""one of the biggest airports in the world -- some say it's the biggest.""

Facts First: Miami International is certainly not the biggest airport in the world.

The airport was not in the top 20 for passenger traffic in 2018 or 2017 . It ranked 15th in cargo traffic in 2018 and 14th in 2017, with less than half of the tonnage of cargo of top-ranked Hong Kong.

Though world airports authorities do not release rankings of airports' physical size, Miami International is not even close to the largest airport in the United States. Chicago's O'Hare, for example, occupies about 7,200 acres, Miami International 3,230 acres

Special elections in North Carolina

""You saw what happened in North Carolina: We picked up two seats that people didn't think we were going to pick up. That was two weeks ago,"" Trump said.

Facts First: The special elections in North Carolina were : The special elections in North Carolina were six weeks ago , not two weeks ago. While the race in the 9th District was considered competitive, the race in the 3rd District was expected by pollsters and analysts to be won easily by the Republican candidate.

Both seats had previously been held by Republicans, so the party did not pick them up. (Trump might have just been speaking informally.)

As the stalemate continues, some students are playing board games or making origami instead of learning in class -- and some parents are torn about which side to support.

""I support both sides, but I think they need to come to a mutual agreement and give a little on both sides because they're only hurting the kids,"" said Dominique Williams, the mother of two teens on the city's tough west side.

The union wants smaller class sizes, more support staff and higher raises for all educators. The city has offered some concessions , but said it can't afford to meet all their demands.

Former teacher Elizabeth Warren joins the picket lines

Teachers got a boost of support Tuesday from Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren joins striking teachers Tuesday in Chicago.

""Everyone in America should support you in this strike,"" said Warren, herself a former teacher.

""The reason is because when you go out and fight, you don't just fight for yourselves. You fight for their children of this city, and the children of this country. I believe in public education. I believe it is time in America to make a new investment in public education.""

One of the greatest needs is for more social workers in schools. That's especially true in Chicago, where many students struggle with poverty, violence and grief at a very young age

""Everything is so different from the way it used to be. It seems like things are just getting more and more chaotic as the years go by,"" Williams said.

""A lot of these kids do need help. ... Some of these kids do need that social worker because they can't talk to their parent. Or they can't talk to their friend. So they'll talk to that social worker because it's a separate entity away from what they got going on.""

One school social worker said she has to split her time between four buildings and 1,039 students.

""I'm tired of telling kids that I can only be there 1 1/2 days of the entire week,"" she said. ""We can't plan our crises according to when I'm there.""

Darian Martyniuk, the father of two elementary school students, said he appreciates what the teachers are fighting for. But they may be asking too much from Chicago Public Schools.

""While I think the teachers have some noble and worthy demands that need to be addressed, I think the union leadership is at best behaving cynically, at worst using whatever leverage they think they have to squeeze the most out of a system that doesn't have anything left to give,"" Martuniuk said.

""Additional staffing like librarians, nurses, counselors ... there are legitimate teacher needs for more. But the union leadership doesn't seem to understand the finance structure of CPS and how it is a limited pool of money. You can't just keep raising taxes year after year because legally they can't do that.""

'I'm pissed,' one mother says

Mayor Lori Lightfoot said even though she and the union want some of the same things, it's time for the union to stop striking.

""There is a finite pot of money. We don't have unlimited cash to keep funding the things that are aspirational and maybe things that, on values that we share,"" Lightfoot said.

""We have to live within our means. That's what the taxpayers expect of us, and that's what we're going to do.""

Williams, the mother who has two teens on the city's west side, said the dueling sides need to stop bickering.

""I'm pissed at the fact that the kids have been out for so long,"" she said. ""They need their class time.""

During Tuesday's bargaining, CTU Chief of Staff Jennifer Johnson said 25 coaches took part in a ""powerful meeting,"" during which they called for more investment in equipment, uniforms and transportation and more pay for coaches. Union officials and schools officials also discussed class sizes and staffing, she said.

""There was progress but we're still clear that we have not landed on just terms yet,"" Johnson said. ""We are clear that we're looking for a substantial investment that addresses our members and students' concerns.""

Johnson said picket lines will be suspended Wednesday as parents, teachers, students and allies plan to converge on downtown Chicago for a rally.

(CNN) Will 2020 see the return of the brokered national political convention -- that is, a convention where delegates are unable to agree on a nominee during the first round of voting, making it necessary to ""broker"" delegates between candidates in subsequent rounds to arrive at a nominee?

It's hard to ignore the potential for a first-round deadlock at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) convention next July. While it's true that every four years political pundits warn of the potential for brokered convention, and it hasn't happened in over half a century, the combination of a historically large field of candidates, no clear front-runner , a heavily front-loaded primary schedule and a change in Democratic party rules means that 2020 could be the year the prediction finally comes true.

Let's start with the candidates. Despite several recent drop-outs, 19 Democrats remain in the hunt for the nomination. History tells us that more will quit the race before the Iowa caucuses on February 3, but it's easy to imagine eight or more of the current field, including Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Beto O'Rourke, Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard and, of course, the top tier of Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden staying in the race at least through the New Hampshire primary on February 11.

One of the reasons they are likely to stay in the race is that former Vice President Joe Biden, long the front-runner, now looks weaker than he did. For months now, Biden's national poll average has remained stuck at around 30%. Democratic primary math, by which only candidates receiving at least 15% of the vote are awarded delegates, means the percentage of delegates earned will exceed the percentage of primary votes for the top candidates. Still, it will be a stretch for Biden, or any other candidate, to go from just below 30% in the polls to the 51% of delegates required to secure the nomination.

Polling in the early caucus and primary states provides more evidence for this uncertainty. Recent numbers show a tie between Biden and Elizabeth Warren in the Iowa caucuses, Warren ahead of Biden in New Hampshire and a tie in Nevada -- but it's a tie between Biden and Sanders, not Biden and Warren.

CBS News and YouGov have teamed up to use polling to try to estimate delegate allocation through Super Tuesday on March 3. In September, they estimated that although Biden was ahead, he would fall nearly 150 delegates short of a majority. About a week ago, though, CBS and YouGov changed their forecast to show Warren in the lead, though still somewhat short of a majority.

This swing shows the volatility of the Democratic primary.

Now, as the political scientist Josh Putnam has rightly pointed out , the problem with trusting this approach to forecasting is that all of the primaries do not take place on one day and, as Putnam puts it, ""sequence matters."" The results in one state can influence the result in subsequent states. Speculation about brokered conventions usually dies down once a candidate begins winning primaries and building up momentum. In 2020, though, there will be little time for the natural winnowing of the field that has occurred in the past.

In the one-month period between the Iowa caucuses and Super Tuesday, about 40% of the total number of delegates voting in the first round of the Democratic National Convention will have been selected. In comparison, in 2016 only about a quarter of the delegates were distributed during that same period. A few weeks later, by the end of March, nearly 70% of the delegates will have been chosen.

We are nearly four months from the first primary, and support may coalesce around one or two candidates prior to the start of voting, but if even three potentially viable candidates are left at the end of March, with none having a majority of the delegates already selected, it now becomes very difficult for any one candidate to get to a majority. There simply aren't that many delegates left, and the Democratic party mandates proportional allocation of delegates. The state-level formula is often complex, but in most cases, any candidate receiving at least 15% of either the statewide vote and/or the congressional district vote will be awarded delegates.

Which brings us to the final element that makes a brokered convention more likely this year than in the past: the rules change that the Democratic party made to how voting will work at the 2020 convention

Since delegates are awarded on a proportional basis, it is often difficult for Democratic candidates to get to a majority. This is why both the 2008 and the 2016 Democratic primaries remained competitive late into the spring in both of those years. In fact, neither Barack Obama in 2008 nor Hillary Clinton in 2016 actually earned a majority of what are called pledged delegates during their respective primaries.

The 2008 and 2016 DNC conventions weren't ""brokered,"" though, because Democrats since 1984 have allowed a large number of unpledged or uncommitted delegates to attend and vote at the national convention. These so-called ""superdelegates"" -- and there were more than 700 of them in Philadelphia in 2016 -- are not bound by voting outcomes in any of the states. In fact, this large number of uncommitted superdelegates has made it difficult for Democratic candidates to obtain a majority of committed convention delegates without them.

The influence of the superdelegates over the years has led to cries of unfairness from candidates who were not awarded the nomination. Both Hillary Clinton in 2008 and Bernie Sanders in 2016 could correctly argue that, had the superdelegates offered them support, they could have been the party's nominee.

The presence of unelected superdelegates at a convention of the ""Democratic"" party has become something of an embarrassment: It just seems undemocratic. So, during the 2016 convention, the party decided to establish a "" Unity Reform Commission ,"" which, among other things, devised ways to reduce the role of superdelegates.

The result was a change in the convention rules so that, in 2020, superdelegates will not participate in the first round of voting under this scenario. So it is up to Democratic primary and caucus participants to avoid a brokered convention.

If, for all of the reasons that I've just presented, they fail to unify behind a single candidate, then we will have our first brokered convention in more than 60 years

While this would be exciting to watch, it could also be disastrous for the Democratic party. The superdelegates will enter in round two, and if, as is likely, they throw their weight behind one candidate, how will the other candidates' supporters react? Remember, there is some evidence that ""Bernie or Bust"" voters cost Hillary Clinton the White House in 2016.

(CNN) Reports of former Vice President Joe Biden's political demise have been greatly exaggerated. So says a new national poll taken by CNN . Instead of losing ground, Biden has again separated himself from the field with a substantial lead over his nearest rivals Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.

Polls are an imperfect snapshot of where the race is at any particular moment. They certainly don't predict at this point who will win the nomination and face President Donald Trump next fall. But there is a lot I believe we can learn from this poll.

The poll underlines the looming influence of President Trump on this race for the Democratic nomination. The news unfolding daily of President Trump's abuse of power on Capitol Hill underlines the focus Democrats have on removing Trump -- if not through impeachment , then at the ballot box.

The President's continuing to put his own interests before the country's makes electability the crucial issue for most Democrats. National polls as well as polls in battleground states show Biden as the strongest candidate against Trump, and as impeachment talk ramps up, Biden's status only improves.

As much as some Democratic voters may like the more radical policy proposals of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, Trump's increasingly erratic and corrupt behavior has helped Biden's message that beating Trump is the first and only thing that matters.

This new CNN poll also shows that the President's attacks on Biden and his family have boosted Biden's candidacy. Only weeks ago, it was unclear whether the baseless and false attacks were going to damage or boost Biden's fortunes among Democrats. The poll begins to answer that important question.

Many Democrats have come to Biden's defense and understand that Trump is attacking him in this way because he is the candidate the Republicans most fear. No one likes to be told who should run and who they should vote for. They particularly don't like to be told those things by the opposing party.

Some Democrats are also still extraordinarily bitter about how Hillary Clinton was subjected to misinformation and false and baseless charges in 2016. That sense of injustice among Democrats has proved to be critical insulation for Biden.

The second thing the poll tells us is you don't have to win the debates to win the nomination. While Biden has sometimes come up short on the style points on stage, he has given enough Democrats enough to work with to continue supporting him.

The debates over the last few months have been much more important to the second tier candidates, determining who can stay in the race and who needs to drop out. Neither Biden, Sanders nor Warren has significantly boosted nor hurt their chances for the nomination in the debates -- and that's likely to stay the same until the debates are winnowed down to just a handful of candidates.

We also see in this poll that moderate and conservative Democrats, who lack a prominent presence on Twitter and at the big campaign rallies, have stayed with Biden

Most Democrats around the country have not fully tuned into this race and even in Iowa, the site of the first in the nation caucus, nearly 75% of respondents to the most recent statewide poll , showing the race a dead heat, said they had not watched the CNN-NY Times debate in Columbus Ohio . If they're not watching yet in Iowa, you can bet there are large portions of Democrats waiting until next year to fully tune in to the race.

Finally, I think this poll dispels the idea from some observers that Democrats are looking for more candidates to enter the field. Biden's strength in this poll and in the various head to head polls with Trump in battleground states should put to rest the story of discontent with our candidates that repeats in almost every election cycle for the Democrats.

So, here's what the poll doesn't tell us: who's going to win the nomination. I have no doubt the poll accurately reflects Biden's strength nationally, as well as the strength of both Sanders and Warren. But national numbers have often proved less than predictive in the Democratic nomination process.

The race is a dynamic one -- what happens in Iowa will impact New Hampshire and what happens in New Hampshire impacts what happens in Nevada and so on.

The new numbers are not insignificant however. After Nevada and South Carolina we quickly move into large, multistate Tuesday primaries where national standing has much more impact.

The race remains wide open for those in the top tier and even a few in the second tier. But it reminds us to take with a grain of salt any predictions about the demise or the rise of any particular candidate and to wait until the voters have their say to decide this contest."

Cory Booker on Wednesday offered up a solution for Democrats searching out an understudy: himself.

""To those Democrats who are looking for an alternative right now,"" Booker said at the National Press Club in Washington, ""I want to make the case today very directly: look no further.""

The New Jersey Democrat pointed to Biden's diminished fundraising and sliding support in some polls as signs that the former vice president's campaign has weakened.

""I'm getting calls from people, Biden supporters, who want to hedge their bet,"" Booker said. But he did not point to any factors that might be contributing to doubts about Biden, and noted he maintains ""a tremendous amount of respect"" for the former vice president.

Booker's remarks came in response to reports this week of some angst-ridden Democrats fretting about the primary field as it stands today. In a time-honored tradition of presidential primaries, the political hand-wringing has included some chatter about late entrants to the already saturated field, according to those reports.

Following this theory to its logical conclusion, Biden would lose ground as the primary season goes on.

Yet Biden’s mostly held his 30%. (Warren’s been gaining ground mostly at the expense of other candidates.)

Indeed, outside of some big event, our poll suggests that Biden’s floor may be stabler than others.

The majority of his voters (59%) say they will definitely support Biden in his fight for the Democratic nomination. Only 41% say they might change their mind.

For all voters of the other candidates, it’s reversed: 40% say they will definitely back their candidate and 60% say they might change their mind.

When you take a look at the horserace among voters who say they have definitely made up their mind, it’s Biden at 47%, Sanders at 25% and Warren at 11%. Among those who say they might change their mind, it’s Warren at 25%, Biden at 24% and Sanders and Buttigieg at 8%.

This looks very similar to what we saw in our last poll of likely caucusgoers in Iowa: Biden and Sanders do best among those who are certain of their choice. Warren does far worse.

That makes some sense, given Warren has gained a lot of supporters recently, and they may be more likely to switch away from her. Meanwhile, Biden and Sanders backers have been with their candidates for longer."

Sanders does not name Hillary Clinton in the tweet, but his comments appear to be aimed at the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, whose claim last week on a podcast with former Obama adviser David Plouffe that the Russians are ""grooming"" a Democrat in the 2020 presidential primary to run as a third-party candidate and champion their interests has caused a backlash. Clinton also accused 2016 Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein of being a ""Russian asset.""

Clinton's team on Monday declined to comment to CNN about Sanders' tweet.

Gabbard, who endorsed Sanders over Clinton during the 2016 presidential election, responded to her on Friday, calling her ""queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party."" Gabbard also said in a tweeted video message on Sunday, ""If they can falsely portray me as a traitor, then they can do it to anyone.""

""That's exactly the message that they want to get across to you: that if you stand up against Hillary and the party power brokers, if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message,"" Gabbard said.

""I am not a Russian spy,"" Stein said. ""I think this is a completely unhinged conspiracy theory for which there is absolutely no basis in fact. Not for myself and not for Tulsi Gabbard. I think it's really outrageous that Hillary Clinton is trying to promote this crazy idea.""

Clinton's team, after receiving bipartisan criticism, said the former secretary of state was saying that Republicans and President Donald Trump were grooming the congresswoman.

""Folks, listen to the podcast. She doesn't say the Russians are grooming anyone. It was a question about Republicans,"" Clinton spokesperson Nick Merrill tweeted on Friday.

Sanders is not the only 2020 Democratic candidate to weigh in on the controversy.

Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas also defended Gabbard, saying she ""is not being groomed by anyone"" and that the focus of the campaign should be on the economy, climate change and other issues affecting Americans.

""That's not correct. Tulsi is not being groomed by anyone. She is her own person,"" he told reporters after delivering a keynote address Saturday at the Alabama Democratic Conference Semi-Annual Convention in Birmingham. ""Obviously (she) has served this country, continues to serve this country, in uniform, in Congress, as a candidate for presidency, so I think those facts speak for themselves.""

Perry is a journalist and historian. He's the senior academic adviser to the History Department at the University of Minnesota. Follow him on Twitter .

(CNN) As the Republic of Venice slowly slid into the 18th century, its economic power was waning while military threats piled up all around it. Inside the city, though, it maintained a vibrant cultural and political life.

When its elites, visiting nobility, and the lower status citizens of the city wanted to mingle, they all would put on masks. Far from the elaborate contraptions sold on every corner in the touristy city, mostly these masks didn't do much to conceal identity. Instead, they provided a polite fiction that allowed people to cross social lines without threatening social norms. Early modern Venetians had masks; today, politicians have Twitter.

Last week, Sen. Mitt Romney told The Atlantic writer McKay Coppins that he had a secret Twitter account , offering just enough details that Ashley Feinberg, who writes for Slate, could deduce its identity . Feinberg reasoned that Romney would want to follow his family members, including his grandchildren, some of whom have relatively few followers. Feinberg introduced us to Twitter user @qaws9876 , aka Pierre Delecto. When Coppins confronted Romney with the deduction, the senator replied only, ""C'est moi"" (or ""it's me,"" in French).

The revelations about Romney's activity on Twitter come at a curious time for the ""sometimes Trump"" Republican caucus, whose ranks include Romney. These Republicans, who include both lawmakers and writers , took principled positions against the president when he was running for the GOP nomination, mostly backed him against Clinton or suggested they might futilely write-in another option.

Since Trump's election, they have oscillated back and forth from quiescent subjugation to periodic public complaint about presidential conduct. These complaints never seem to result in Republicans organizing against Trump from within. Only rarely has this cohort voted against Trump's norms in Congress ( with a few notable exceptions ) and never have they publicly campaigned for Democrats. In fact, as Elizabeth Warren seems to have emerged as at least a co-frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, most ""Sometimes Trump"" writers seem to be setting themselves up to reluctantly support the president

But now with Trump and his cronies — both staff like Mick Mulvaney and on-again off-again personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani — almost daily confessing to transgressions, it's both easier for Republicans like Romney to stand against the president and harder for him to stay quiet.

Twitter is a performative space, at least if you have a public account. Whereas Facebook has sophisticated layering of privacy options — often bewildering to the casual user — that encourage participation within closed, selected, networks of mutual connections, Twitter promotes the short, loud blast. It's a place that works very well for sharing news and for making like-minded connections. Its public nature also comes with the serious risk of harassment and bullying.

His mask had come off, but he hadn't used this private account to do anything especially significant. Pierre Delecto only tweeted 10 times. Feinberg noted that a number of responses were aimed at journalists directly criticizing Romney and other Republicans for a lack of spine in the face of Trump's flagrant misconduct. Wait and see, Romney seemed to suggest, but there's nothing revelatory here. We've been waiting to see for a long time.

I'm a historian of pre-modern Venice and often think about the efforts that medieval democracy undertook to maintain social order, protect their electoral systems, and thrive in a fraught space between different spheres of power (Rome, the Holy Roman Empire, Byzantium and then the Ottomans, Catholics versus Protestants, and more over the centuries).

Their masks have enhanced a reputation for secrecy and debauchery, that ""anything goes"" once the masks are on. In the recent book, ""Venice Incognito,"" though, historian James Johnson argues that masks were in many cases a tool of the status quo, ""permitting contact among unequals through fictive concealment. Rather than obscuring identities, masks affirmed their permanence."" The donning of a mask created a fiction that affirmed social structures, rather than threatening them.

Mitt Romney and a handful of other Republican leaders have a chance to act. But they are going to have do so without masks and, most critically, they are going to have to risk upsetting their own delicate position. Romney and the rest will have to stop performing principled resistance and actually resist. Trump will eventually be gone, but for America to move past this difficult moment, all the masks must come off."
738,"Katelyn Polantz, Scott Glover, and Vicky Ward, CNN","Washington (CNN)Long before they burst onto the national scene with their high-profile arrests at Dulles International Airport earlier this month, Soviet-born businessmen Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were already turning heads in Republican fundraising circles.… [+7840 chars]","Long before they burst onto the national scene with their high-profile arrests at Dulles International Airport earlier this month, Soviet-born businessmen Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were already turning heads in Republican fundraising circles.",2019-10-23,CNN,How two businessmen hustled to profit from access to Rudy Giuliani and the Trump administration,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/23/politics/parnas-fruman-hustle-profit-access-giuliani/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Long before they burst onto the national scene with their high-profile arrests at Dulles International Airport earlier this month, Soviet-born businessmen Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were already turning heads in Republican fundraising circles.

""They seemed like hustlers -- but not in a bad way. In a good way,"" one high-ranking Republican operative familiar with the pair told CNN.

But a CNN review of campaign contributions and court filings, as well as interviews with nearly a dozen people with knowledge of Parnas and Fruman's interactions, tell a different story. The pair raked in hundreds of thousands of dollars and jetted around the world touting their connections to Giuliani and the Trump administration while pushing for business and favors, even claiming to arrange a Fox News interview, right up until the day they were arrested for conspiracy and campaign-finance related charges.

At one point, they pushed a Ukrainian businessman to pay them to bring Trump administration officials to Ukraine. At another time, they convinced a Florida-based businessman to loan them $100,000 so they could connect him with Giuliani and other prominent conservatives. And in a third instance, they attempted to influence the management board of a Ukrainian gas company.

""They presented themselves as successful businesspeople with business interests across the country and in Europe,"" said the GOP source, who requested anonymity, citing the ongoing criminal probe into the men. ""They just said they loved the President and what he's doing.""

When the pair made a $325,000 donation to a pro-Trump super PAC in May 2018, they were subjected to standard vetting designed to detect any problems or conflicts with major donors, the source said.

""They didn't find any reason why we shouldn't take their money,"" said the Republican with knowledge of the matter. ""So we did.""

On the day the indictment was unsealed, the PAC itself said, ""America First Action takes our legal obligations seriously and scrupulously complies with the law,"" according to a statement issued by the group the day the indictment was unsealed.

But the pair's business and networking activities over the past year had raised red flags with several prominent businessmen and their attorneys, CNN has learned.

Parnas and Fruman were in federal court on Wednesday after being arrested several weeks earlier in a corridor at Dulles airport near Lufthansa departing flights. They pleaded not guilty to allegations of funneling Russian money into Nevada politics and of circumventing federal campaign finance laws to make straw donations to advance the political interests of at least one Ukrainian official, including the $325,000 donation to the pro-Trump PAC, America First Action.

Defense attorneys for Parnas and Fruman declined to comment for this story on Wednesday.

""Radioactive wolves""

Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas (second and third from left) pictured with Vice President Mike Pence, President Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani

Bruce Marks, an attorney in Philadelphia who represents prominent Eastern Europeans, told CNN in recent days there was a Russian proverb that applied to Fruman and Parnas.

""Don't go in the forest if you're afraid of wolves,"" Marks said. ""And these guys, they just weren't wolves, I mean they were radioactive wolves.""

Marks represents the Ukrainian billionaire Ihor Kolomoisky, who is a major supporter of the new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In the lead-up to Zelensky's inauguration this May, Parnas and Fruman approached Kolomoisky during a trip to Israel.

They wanted a six-figure payment, Marks said, and in exchange they told the billionaire they could set up a meeting between Zelensky and a delegation of American officials.

""My recollection is that they were talking about Vice President Pence, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, and they said that they needed to have money in order to ensure that they would come,"" Marks told CNN. They also touted their connection to Giuliani to the Ukrainian businessman, Marks said.

""They were going to be responsible for arranging for American government officials to come to Mr. Zelensky's inauguration,"" he added.

Kolomoisky refused, Marks said.

There was no indication that Pence, Perry or anyone in the Trump administration or Ukrainian government were aware of those efforts.

Perry and State Department officials did travel to Ukraine for the inauguration, arranged through official government channels.

Search for cash

It wasn't the only time Parnas and Fruman tried to use their connections to Giuliani to push for cash. In March of this year, they pitched their influence and ties to Trump's administration to a Ukrainian gas executive at an energy conference in Houston

And they've been spotted in years of photos alongside Giuliani, Trump and even other lawyers to the President. Giuliani did not return multiple requests for comment on this story.

Over the past year, the pair hustled for hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans and payments.

In the fall of 2018, Parnas was telling his wealthy contacts that he was short on cash and seeking loans, according to three people familiar with his requests. Among his alleged troubles, one source said, was that he needed money to pay Giuliani to be a spokesperson for one of Parnas' companies. Giuliani has said he was retained by that company to provide business and legal advice because of his related experience.

That wasn't their only ask. South Florida attorney Robert Stok told CNN in an interview that Parnas and Fruman came to a wealthy client of his seeking money, claiming they were so short on cash they couldn't even pay for Parnas' newborn son's bris.

Stok said the men asked Felix Vulis, a Russian-American natural resources magnate, if he could kick in some money for the event.

They had also promised to open doors for Vulis through their connections to Giuliani and others, including the Washington lobbyist Brian Ballard, the former chief of staff to Mike Pence Nick Ayers and others. This added to Parnas and Fruman's credibility with Vulis.

Vulis was intrigued enough to loan them $100,000, writing a check to Parnas' company Global Energy Producers in October 2018, which included a memo for a ""loan to Igor and Lev (two month),"" according to Stok and other records reviewed by CNN.

""The thing that made him really pull the trigger was the fact he felt sorry for them, because of their financial constraints,"" Stok said. Any proposed networking in Republican circles never happened, Stok said.

When they were slow to repay, Vulis sued. Vulis told their since-indicted associate David Correia over text message he had been ripped off, and that he planned to tell Giuliani, Ayers and others that Parnas and Fruman would face a lawsuit. Correia pleaded not guilty.

Parnas and Fruman fought the case for months but ultimately repaid the debt a few weeks before Giuliani publicly admitted to asking Ukraine for political help, a key early development in the House impeachment inquiry. The exact details of their settlement with Vulis remain private.

This August, ""all of a sudden they were able to fork over a check,"" Stok said.

An aborted trip to Vienna

Two weeks ago when they were arrested, Parnas and Fruman were preparing to fly to Vienna, Austria, to meet Giuliani and another key figure in the impeachment investigation, Ukraine's former prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, according to four sources familiar with their trip. Shokin is the same Ukrainian official who former Vice President Joe Biden -- along with other Western leaders -- had pushed to have removed over concerns he wasn't prosecuting corruption.

While questions in Washington swirl around Shokin's role in this controversy, Giuliani, Parnas, Fruman had specific plans for the former Ukrainian official up until the day of their arrest. According to those four sources, they told others they were headed to Vienna to help with a planned interview the next day: Shokin, they said, was scheduled to do an interview from the Austrian capital with Sean Hannity.

Through a spokesperson, Hannity said that ""we never reveal our sources, potential sources, or persons they may or may not request to interview. Sean Hannity takes the first amendment seriously."""

Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) slow, steady rise in national polls is hitting a snag, as the latest National Emerson College poll shows the presidential hopeful falling to third place, behind Joe Biden (D) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).

The post-debate survey, taken October 18-21, 2019, among 430 Democrat primary voters, shows Biden regaining his frontrunner status with 27 percent support. Sanders, who has struggled in recent national polls, saw a spike, jumping to second place with 25 percent support. The survey shows the Massachusetts senator dropping to third place with 21 percent support. With a margin of error of +/- 4.7 percent, the three are statistically tied.

The poll reflects Sen. Kamala Harris’s (D-CA) continued tailspin, dropping behind Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s (D), who saw six percent support to Harris’s five percent. Andrew Yang (D) experienced a slight bump, garnering four percent support, followed by Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with three percent each. The remaining candidates saw two percent support or less.

Results also show that Sanders, who just received the formal endorsement of young, freshman socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), continues to have a stronghold on younger voters (18-29) with 45 percent of their support. No one else comes close, as Warren gains 17 percent support from that age group, and Yang is right behind her, earning 15 percent support. While Biden only sees 12 percent support among young voters, his backing increases exponentially among older voters. He is garnering 17 percent support from those aged 30-49 and 44 percent support from those 50 and older.

The economy remains the most important issue for 31 percent of voters in deciding whom to support in the presidential election, “followed by social issues at 14%, healthcare at 13%, impeachment at 11%, immigration at 10% and the environment at 8%,” according to the poll’s results.

“Gun policy and education are tied at 5%, and foreign policy is the least important issue for voters at 4%,” it adds."

Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) frontrunner status does not appear to have lasted longer than the time it takes to boil water.

The big news today is a poll from the far-left CNN, which shows former Vice President Joe Biden surging to a 34 to 19 percent lead over Warren, with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) hanging on — heart attack and all — to third place with 16 percent support.

Granted, this is only one poll, and it is CNN, but if Biden is indeed at 34 percent nationally, that is about where a frontrunner needs to be. Thirty-five percent is considered the safe zone in a crowded race.

While I don’t have an enormous amount of faith in CNN’s polling, comparing the trends within a particular poll is always useful, and those look especially bad for America’s Favorite Fake Indian. Since June, in this same poll, Warren’s favorability number has climbed just two points, from 36 to 38 percent, but her unfavorable rating has also climbed, from 38 to 41 percent.

Most importantly, she is upside down on favorability, 38 to 41 percent, and the only top tier Democrat candidate with that problem.

By comparison, Sanders enjoys 48 to 45 percent favorability rating. Mayor Pete Buttigieg is right-side up at 28 to 23 percent. Joe Biden enjoys an incredible advantage at 74 to 20 percent.

On the top four issues of the day, Biden enjoys a wide lead among Democrats. On foreign policy, 56 percent say Biden will do the best job, compared to 13 percent for Sanders and just 11 percent for Warren. On the economy, it’s Biden 38 percent, Sanders 19 percent, and Warren 16 percent. On guns , it’s Biden 27 percent, Sanders 13 percent, and Warren 11 percent. On immigration, it’s Biden 29 percent, with Warren and Sanders tied at 16 percent.

In worse news for Chief Lies-Like-a-Rug, Warren is slipping everywhere else. Two weeks ago, in the Real Clear Politics poll of polls, Warren was tied with Biden nationally and even led in a number of polls.

In the seven most recent polls, however, Biden has a steady lead; in six of those polls he leads anywhere from 8 to 15 points.

The real problem for Warren, though, is that she wilts under scrutiny. As soon as the “frontrunner” status swung the spotlight her way, everything that makes Elizabeth Warren a terrible candidate was once again magnified times ten.

On top of her extremist policies, she’s a weak, shrill, dishonest neurotic. During this last debate, there was nothing to instill confidence among those looking for someone tough enough to take on Trump, especially when she dissembled over and over again when asked a simple question about how she intends to pay for her Medicare For All plan without raising taxes on the middle class.

The primary thing voters look for in a candidate is strength and competence. Are they strong, unable to be rattled? Are you the alpha male (or female)? But whenever she’s under pressure Warren unravels like Lucy Ricardo when Ricky catches her sneaking into his nightclub.

In short, Elizabeth Warren is a mess. This was obvious — hell, everything was obvious about Warren’s inability to handle pressure after she bungled the release of her DNA results last year. As I said at the time, that was the single worst political debacle since John McCain suspended his 2008 presidential campaign to run off and save the economy. She made a fool of herself, and that is almost impossible to overcome.

For that reason, I was legitimately surprised when she became the frontrunner earlier this month, but I was not at all surprised when she immediately fell apart as soon as the scrutiny arrived.

The Federal Reserve has been pumping tens of billions of dollars into the market for overnight and short-term repurchase agreements, or repos, for several weeks. On Tuesday, the Fed swapped $99 billion of cash for securities held by banks.

In a letter addressed to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who chairs the Financial Stability Oversight Council, Warren asked the secretary to explain the causes of the market turmoil. She pointed out that many of the early attempts to explain the disruption–including large corporates tax payments due in mid-September–either never made much sense or fail to explain why the market continues to need so much additional liquidity.

“I am also concerned that, ‘Big U.S. banks are using the recent chaos short funding markets as an opportunity to pressure the Federal Reserve to ease liquidity requirements they l1ave long despised,'” Warren wrote, quoting from a Reuters report.

The Fed imposed new liquidity requirements after the financial crisis in an effort to avoid having to bail out banks in the future. Banks are supposed to have enough liquid assets, primarily cash and Treasury bonds, that they could sustain a short-term market disruption. Prior to the new regulations, many large financial institutions were often just days away from collapse if they could not obtain short-term funding.

Many on Wall Street now believe the liquidity regulations are playing a role in the problems with the short-term funding market, encouraging banks to “hoard liquidity” rather than lend it out. And, indeed, this is quickly becoming part of the case for reforming the liquidity requirements."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) took her 2020 campaign for the Democrat presidential nomination to Chicago on Tuesday, where she joined striking members of the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) on the picket lines.

Warren said in a speech delivered to a crowd of teachers gathered on the picket lines in West Chicago:

I’m here to stand for America’s public schools. I’m here to stand with Chicago’s teachers. I’m here to stand with Chicago nurses. I’m here to stand with Chicago’s librarians. I’m here to stand with Chicago’s bus drivers. I’m here to stand with the low wage workers in the Chicago schools. I also am here to stand with our unions. To stand with SEIU, to stand with CTU, and here’s why–because the unions are how we have a voice. The unions are how we have power.

“The unions are how we make sure that the needs of every one of our children are heard loud and clear,” she added.

The Chicago Tribune reported Warren’s appearance came “hours after union President Jesse Sharkey accused Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration of ‘vindictive actions’ for suggesting the union go back to work without a contract and saying there was no more money for teacher demands.”

The strike began on Thursday morning, and Tuesday is the fourth day that classes have been cancelled for the 361,000 students who attend the Chicago Public Schools.

In her speech, Warren made no mention of the dismal academic performance of those students when compared to the national average, or the role the striking teachers have in failing to improve that performance.

Earlier in her speech, Warren said, “everyone in America should support you in this strike. And the reason is because when you go out and fight, you don’t just fight for yourselves, you fight for the children of this city, and the children of this country,” adding:

I believe in public education, and I believe it is time in America to make a new investment in public education. And I got a plan for that. America’s public schools need a partner in Washington.Not a partner who’s going to tell them what to do. Not a partner who’s going to do high stakes testing. Not a partner who’s going to pinch pennies. But a partner who’s going to be there, to back you up in the critically important work you do every day. And for me, that start’s with an $800 billion investment in our public schools. It starts with quadrupling our funding for title one schools. Let’s level the playing field. It starts with full funding for IDEA for all of our children who are in special education. And it starts with a grant to every single public school in this country so that that public school can decide how to spend the money that it needs to provide the first rate education for the children it has.

CTU President Jesse Sharkey made it clear on Tuesday he intends to play hard ball with Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Chicago Public Schools (CPS) to get more money for the 25,000 teachers in his union, as The Tribune reported:

In an email sent [to the Tribune] after midnight, Sharkey said, “Our bargaining team was beginning to see glimmers of progress on issues that matter to our members. (Monday) that progress stopped dead. “It was clear from the mayor’s letter to the press demanding members go back to work without a contract and from the sudden atmosphere of stonewalling from the CPS team, that (Lightfoot) had pulled the plug on negotiations,” Sharkey continued. “The mayor’s team said that there was no more money in the budget to address the many outstanding demands that are necessary to deliver justice for our school communities,” he said.

Tuesday’s rally was kicked off by Brandon Johnson, who declared he is “a proud member of the Chicago Teachers Union. I am also proud to be the Cook County Commissioner of the First District.”

Johnson said:

This moment has been brought to you by the largest political resistance that we’ve seen in a generation. For those that have taken us for granted for the last 35 years, the Chicago Teachers Union and SEIU we’re saying enough is enough. We’re not going to turn back now.

“We are going to secure economic justice today,” he added,

Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, the national union with which the CTU is affiliated, also addressed the crowd:

I feel like I have been in Chicago so much the last few weeks that I probably have to start paying property taxes. It shouldn’t have taken, as [CTU President] Jesse [Sharkey] said, to the brink of a strike in order to have real negotiations. There were more negotiations in the first two days of the strike than in the last ten months, that’s what’s wrong with this bargaining process.

Thursday marked the first day of the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) strike, resulting in the cancellation of classes for the 361,000 K-12 students who attend Chicago Public Schools (CPS). The union and CPS have been unable to reach a negotiation on numerous issues, including salaries, benefits, and classroom size.

Warren is expected to join them as they go into their fourth day of the strike.

NBC Chicago reports:

According to a campaign email, the stop in Chicago will be part of a two-stop swing for the Democratic presidential candidate on Tuesday. Warren will join striking teachers in Chicago at a South Austin elementary school on the city’s West Side, picketing with teachers and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten.

Warren has made tangible efforts to position herself as one of the most outspoken pro-union 2020 candidates, joining airport food workers in a minimum wage protest at Reagan National Airport in July:

On Labor Day, Warren called for “stronger unions” and declared that unions will “rebuild America’s middle class.”

As for the CTU, negotiations are still underway, but progress, according to CTU President Jesse Sharkey, has halted. Sharkey accused Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration of “vindictive actions” and added that her recent letter “dashed our hopes of a quick settlement,” according to the Chicago Tribune.

According to the report:

Sharkey’s accusation came after Lightfoot and Chicago Public Schools CEO Janice Jackson made a plea to teachers to end their strike before a settlement and continue negotiations while working without a contract, leading Sharkey to say after negotiations ended for the day that Lightfoot’s letter had “dashed our hopes for a quick settlement.”

Sharkey said in an email that their bargaining team was “beginning to see glimmers of progress on issues that matter to our members” but added that progress “stopped dead” on Monday.

“It was clear from the mayor’s letter to the press demanding members go back to work without a contract and from the sudden atmosphere of stonewalling from the CPS team, that (Mayor Lori Lightfoot) had pulled the plug on negotiations,” Sharkey wrote, according to the Chicago Tribune.

“The mayor’s team said that there was no more money in the budget to address the many outstanding demands that are necessary to deliver justice for our school communities,” he added.

While Lightfoot and CPS CEO Janice Jackson have said that “real progress” was being made, both made it clear that the strikes are hurting students.

They wrote:

For the fourth straight school day, students from throughout the city won’t be participating in the athletic competitions they’ve earned the right to compete in, won’t be preparing their college applications with trusted school staff, and won’t be in classrooms with the teachers who hold the keys to their success.

“We must fix that immediately and end this strike,” they added."

The poll, taken October 1-3, among 887 likely U.S. voters, shows the president edging out all of his potential Democrat challengers, minus Warren, who tied with Trump with 45 percent support. Notably, ten percent said they were “not sure” who they would vote for between the two.

While many Democrats view Biden as the most electable candidate, the survey’s results show Trump defeating Biden 47 percent to 45 percent thanks, in part, to the president closing the gap in support among independent, suburban, and Hispanics voters.

According to Zogby Analytics:

The reason President Trump is winning, barely, in a hypothetical match-up with the former vice president, Joe Biden, is that, in addition to winning with his normal base of men (Trump leads 54% to 39%), white voters (Trump leads 53% to 40%), union voters (Trump leads 62% to 32%), and southern voters (Trump leads 50% to 43%), Trump has also tightened the race with Independents (Biden leads 42% to 36%), suburban voters (Biden leads 49% to 43%), and Hispanics (Biden leads 47% to 43%). Trump is also beating Biden convincingly with two demographics he has recently made inroads with: large city voters (Trump leads 50% to 44%) and Generation X voters age 30-49 (Trump leads 49% to 41%).

Trump also beats Sanders by a two-point margin, 46 percent to 44 percent, although Sanders continues to hold an edge with younger voters (18-29) with 56 percent support to Trump’s 37 percent.

The president appears to perform the best against Buttigieg, who has failed to break through the top tier of candidates in the crowded Democrat field. Trump beats him by 11 points – 49 percent to 38 percent – and defeats Harris 47 percent to 41 percent. The margin of error is +/- 3.3 percent.

Biden has 34 percent support among Democrats/Democrat-leaning independents who are registered to vote while Sen. Elizabeth Warren only registers 19 percent support. Sen. Bernie Sanders has 16 percent while Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris only have six percent support each. Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke end up with three percent support.

Political analysts believed the fourth Democrat debate hosted by CNN would shake up the race, as Biden continued to deliver an underwhelming performance and other candidates targeted Sen. Elizabeth Warren. And respondents seemed to agree with this assessment. When asked “which candidate do you think did the best job in the debate?” Warren was ranked number one with 28%, Biden second at 15%, and Bernie Sanders third at 13%.

Yet Biden’s support jumped ten points from the last poll taken in September, from 24 percent to 34 percent. Warren only increased her support by one percent.

Biden was also targeted by President Donald Trump for corruption in recent weeks, as the president attacked Biden’s son Hunter for his shady foreign business deals in Ukraine and China while his father was vice president.

A big majority of moderate/conservative Democrat voters chose Biden as their first choice; 43 percent to Warren’s 12 percent and Bernie Sanders ten percent.

Fifty-three percent of potential Democrat voters in the poll said that they might change their minds, while 46 percent said that they would definitely support their first choice.

While most national polls have shown a tight race between the former vice president and Sen. Elizabeth Warren in recent weeks – with Warren topping Biden in some cases – Morning Consult has consistently shown Biden leading the field.

The current results, taken Oct. 16-20, 2019, show Biden leading the field with 30 percent and Warren in second place with 21 percent. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) came in third with 18 percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), both of whom garnered six percent support each. Sen. Cory Booker (D), Beto O’Rourke (D), and Andrew Yang (D) garnered three percent, and the remaining candidates saw two percent support or less.

While there seems to be a disparity between the national polling results of Morning Consult and that of other polls, the trend remains the same. Morning Consult shows Biden on a slow decline – falling from a 40 percent high in May – and Warren rising, jumping from her seven percent low in March.

Notably, though, is Biden’s drop in favorability. The post-debate poll shows that Biden lost five favorability points following the last debate, dropping from 55 percent to 50 percent. Sanders’ remained the same with 57 percent, and Warren’s jumped by one point, from 52 percent to 53 percent.

Additionally, Warren remains the top second choice for Biden voters, with 28 percent choosing her and 26 percent choosing Sanders. The results are not necessarily reciprocated, as the Sanders holds a slight edge, earning the second choice support from 25 percent of Warren voters compared to Biden’s 24 percent.

The Massachusetts senator remains the top second choice candidate for supporters of Sanders, Harris, and Buttigieg.

The New York lawmaker formally endorsed Sanders at a “Bernie’s Back Rally” in New York on Saturday, crediting him for helping her recognize her “inherent value as a human being who deserves health care, housing, education, and a living wage.” She echoed his vision to fundamentally transform the country and called for an America that is “multigeographic” and “multigendered.”

“Squad” member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) also offered her endorsement of Sanders, calling him the “only candidate who has built a movement.”

Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) has not formally issued an endorsement, but Sanders is expected to join the congresswoman for a tour of her district later this month.

The endorsements from key members of the far-left “Squad” sparked questions about their devotion to feminism and diversity. There is no shortage of women in the crowded Democrat field – Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), and Marianne Williamson (D) – yet they chose the oldest male candidate in the race.

Their decision sparked backlash and inspired a Vice article, which defended their decision from the critiques of “white feminists.” It is titled “Don’t Tell AOC, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib Their Bernie Endorsement Isn’t Feminist.”

“But it’s safe to assume ‘The Squad’ doesn’t need white feminists to help them understand which candidate best supports their feminist principles,” it reads in part.

Ocasio-Cortez said her decision to back Sanders over Warren had nothing to do with gender. Rather, she looked at the “feminist values in the campaign.”

“For me, this is not about ‘Why not any other candidate?'” Ocasio-Cortez said, according to NPR. “The fact that [Sanders] has been fighting for these issues for so long struck me in a very personal way.”

“One of the things that’s so important about what Senator Sanders is talking about, and what this campaign is about, is that it’s far larger than a presidential campaign,” Ocasio-Cortez told NPR, echoing Omar’s remarks. “This is about creating a mass movement.”

Warren did not make a big deal out of Ocasio-Cortez’s endorsement of her opponent, praising the freshman lawmaker for doing “terrific work.”

“I am a fan of the congresswoman. She’s done some terrific work. We have worked together, and I know that once this primary is over we’re all going to be on the same side,” Warren said.

Ocasio-Cortez echoed that sentiment during an interview with CBS This Morning alongside Sanders.

The Fed announcement came without explanation. Recent Fed offerings for the short term repurchase agreements, or repos, have been oversubscribed, meaning banks sought more liquidity than the Fed was prepared to provide.

On Tuesday, the Fed injected nearly $100 billion in combined overnight and slightly-longer term loans to banks.

Senator Elizabeth Warren recently addressed a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in his role as chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, asking for an explanation for why banks have recently required these huge daily cash infusions.

In a repo operation, banks sell bonds to the Treasury in exchange for cash with an agreement to buy them back the following day or in a couple of weeks, depending on the length of the operation. These are the equivalent of very short term loans.

When the Fed initially stepped into the market following a spike in interest rates for repos in September, the interventions were much smaller and expected to last just a few weeks. Since then, however, the market has demanded increasing amounts of liquidity with no end in sight. It is now considered very likely that such operations could become permanent.

Since the loans are paid back to the Fed after a short period, they are not thought to have any inflationary effect."

The New York Times on Tuesday ran a piece centering around concerns of establishment Democrats, who are not confident that anyone in the current Democrat field — not Joe Biden (D), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), or Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — could successfully take down President Trump in the 2020 general election.

“Since the last debate, just anecdotally, I’ve had five or six people ask me: ‘Is there anybody else?’” Leah Daughtry, who the Times described as a “longtime Democrat who has run two of the party’s recent conventions,” said.

That is just one example of many. According to the Times, many Democrats — from voters to high-profile lawmakers — are worried about the state of the current Democrat field and are quietly looking for a savior:

“There’s more anxiety than ever,” said Connie Schultz, a journalist who is married to Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, another Democrat who some in the party would like to see join the race. “We’re both getting the calls. I’ve been surprised by some who’ve called me.” “I can see it, I can feel it, I can hear it,” Mitch Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor, said of the unease within the party. He said he thinks Mr. Biden is best positioned to defeat Mr. Trump but called the former vice president’s fund-raising “a real concern.”

Clinton and billionaire Michael Bloomberg are reportedly keeping tabs on the mounting concerns and “have both told people privately in recent weeks that if they thought they could win, they would consider entering the primary,” according to the Times. However, they are “skeptical there would be an opening, according to Democrats who have spoken with them.”

The Times adds that Democrats familiar with their thinking do not see either jumping in unless Biden goes down:

The chances that another major contender decides to run are remote: While Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Bloomberg have both been encouraged to enter the race, Democrats close to them believe the only scenario under which they’d consider running is if Mr. Biden drops out or is badly weakened.

The Washington Post also signaled that a 2020 run for Clinton remains on the table, as Democrats continue to worry about Biden’s mounting baggage and the ultra-liberal policies of his closest contenders.

“Hillary Clinton, according to two people close to her, has not ruled out jumping in herself, a sign that she is hearing similar dissatisfaction,” the Post reported:

Those close to Clinton, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment on her behalf, say she has felt vindicated over the past few weeks as Trump’s political difficulties have deepened. That sentiment was reinforced this week when the State Department announced its probe into emails sent to a private server, a major complication of her 2016 campaign, found no evidence of deliberate mishandling of classified information by department employees.

One source who spoke with Clinton said that it is “unlikely” that she would throw her hat into the presidential ring for the third time but emphasized that the chances “ain’t zero.”

“But put it this way: It ain’t zero. And does she think about it all the time? Absolutely,” the source said, according to the Post.

Clinton has made no obvious attempts to extinguish the festering 2020 buzz. This month, Trump teased “Crooked Hillary,” suggesting that she enter the race “to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren.” Clinton warned Trump not to “tempt” her to do so on social media.

I think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren. Only one condition. The Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting “C” Subpoena! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2019

She furthered speculation during an interview with PBS NewsHour, claiming that she could “obviously” beat Trump “again,” although her use of “again” remains unclear, as Trump defeated Clinton by surpassing the required 270 Electoral College threshold.

“Maybe there does need to be a rematch. I mean, obviously, I can beat him again,” Clinton said. “But, just seriously, I don’t understand. I don’t think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.”

The former secretary of state continued to fuel the rumblings by posting a quote from Beyoncé about the need to “take” power on Tuesday.

“Beyoncé speaks the truth,” Clinton wrote in the caption:"

It’s that Latin American peasants seem uniquely amenable to idiotic socialist schemes.

You probably think it’s beyond silliness for Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to keep promising FREE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL! NO PREMIUMS! NO CO-PAYS! ILLEGAL ALIENS, TOO! EVERYBODY GETS A PONY!

No one could be gullible enough to fall for that.

I refer you to the economic powerhouse that is Latin America.

Based on hundreds of years of indigenous people voting for politicians who made similar promises, Latin America has become the dream factory that it is today. That’s why Tegucigalpa is practically a byword for “technological innovation,” Santiago was the picture of calm sophistication this weekend, and Caracas is the ultimate in modern conveniences.

Perhaps you missed the article in last Saturday’s New York Times on what socialism has done for the water system in Venezuela:

The brick shack on the outskirts of Venezuela’s capital is crowded with tubs, jugs and buckets. The water they hold must last the family of eight for a week — but it’s not enough for frequent washing or flushing, so the kitchen is filled with greasy pots and the house smells of stale urine. And none of the water is treated, making diarrhea and vomit a regular occurrence. “We practically live in the bathroom,” said the mother of the family … [Her daughter] sat nearby, pale and listless, recovering from her latest bout of diarrhea just one month away from childbirth.

Democrats: We need some of that Latin American magic!

Twenty years ago, 60 percent of Venezuelans had regular access to safe drinking water. Today, only 30 percent do.

How did this happen?

Answer: Poor Venezuelans voted for it. If we let them in, they’ll vote for it here, too. (Except 20 percent, who will be patriotic Americans, i.e. Republicans.)

That’s great news for Sanders and Warren! But it’s terrible news for the country.

Denouncing “squalid oligarchs,” Hugo Chavez promised Venezuela’s poor: “I will not rest until every human being who lives in this land has housing, employment and some way to manage his life.”

The poor were sold! In December 1998, Chavez was elected in a landslide, commemorated with this Seattle Times headline: “VENEZUELAN SLUM DWELLERS VOTE FOR CHANGE.”

As the Miami Herald explained, Chavez “crystallized anger and frustration among Latin America’s poor at free-market policies that have brought only limited prosperity.”

What did free markets and private property ever do for the poor? If they were poor, but others were rich, the “squalid oligarchs” must have stolen from them! (Elizabeth Warren should borrow that epithet. “Wealthy corporations” is getting old.)

Bernie says he “wrote the damn bill” to give Medicare to all, but he was plagiarizing Chavez, who immediately implemented a “single-payer” system for health care in Venezuela. He set up free health clinics, opened military hospitals to the poor, and deployed tens of thousands of government workers to deliver medical services to the barrios.

At Chavez’s invitation, thousands of poor people took up residence in hotels, warehouses and luxurious golf courses. As one of the squatters explained, “We just want a home for our children.” That could be the epitaph of every once-great country: It was for THE CHILDREN!

As you may have heard, this worked out fantastically well. Within a year of Chavez taking office, the economy had shrunk by 7.2 percent and unemployment was at 20 percent. A decade into this socialist paradise, the poor were poorer than ever. There were constant blackouts, food shortages and appalling infant mortality rates. (Much like what we’re seeing in California.)

Venezuela’s infant mortality from diarrhea alone has sextupled in the past 15 years, according to the World Health Organization. (That’s an estimate, on account of Chavez’s quick response to the crisis, which was to stop releasing public health data.)

Potable water, that most basic element of civilization, is virtually nonexistent. Today, sitting on top of the largest oil reserves in the world, Venezuelans are starving.

Chavez didn’t seize power in a military coup. There was no revolution. He wasn’t imposed on Venezuelans by the C.I.A.

He was the people’s choice, elected president in 1998 (with 56 percent of the vote), then re-elected in 2000 (60 percent), then again in 2006 (63 percent) and yet again in 2012 (54 percent). And that’s not counting all the regional, parliamentary, constitutional and referenda elections his party won, over and over and over again.

Like that other Latin American matinee idol, Eva Peron, Chavez destroyed a country by offering the poor pie-in-the-sky promises that were to be paid for by “the rich.” In both cases, it took only about a decade to turn two of the wealthiest countries in the world into two of the most dysfunctional.

In Mexico, the people voted for the Institutional Revolutionary Party for 71 straight years. Total economic failure, year after year. Yes, please, kick me again!

All of this would be of limited interest outside of psychological circles, except for the fact that these voluntary hellholes are adjacent to our country, which is why our southern border is always besieged with desperate Latin Americans.

They’re fleeing the very systems that they voted for, and which (80 percent) would willingly vote for again.

The key point is this: Everywhere in the world, the working class loves socialism — except the U.S.A. To the dismay of American liberals, their movement has always been bereft of the very proletariat that they claim to champion. Instead of truck drivers and longshoremen, Democratic meetings are full of divorcees, transgenders, vegans, and college professors.

Recall that when student radicals tried to organize blue-collar workers in the ’60s, they ended up getting their heads smashed by building trades guys for protesting the war. Today, America’s working class wears a MAGA hat.

That’s why the Democrats are dying to fling open our southern border. As Lenin might have said, you can’t make an omelet without bringing in millions of poverty-stricken Latin Americans."

Trump made 40 false claims last Thursday alone, including 30 at his campaign rally in Dallas . Thirty false claims is his highest total for a single rally during the 15 weeks we've been counting at CNN; 40 false claims is his second-highest single day total over those 15 weeks.

Trump's total of 87 false claims was the third-highest for the 15 weeks, though it was down from 129 false claims the week prior.

This was equal-opportunity deception. Trump made 17 false claims about military matters, 17 related to Democrats' impeachment inquiry, 15 about the economy and 12 about trade. He treated a visitor to the White House, Italian President Sergio Mattarella, to 25 false claims in their consecutive joint interactions with the media.

The most egregious false claim: The safety of the Kurds

Trump made it hard to pick a most egregious false claim about Syria and Turkey. Among other things, he claimed that troops he is sending from Syria to elsewhere in the Middle East are coming ""home,"" that the Kurdish PKK is a more severe terror threat than ISIS, and that his narrow, concessionary ceasefire deal with Turkey had been sought by other administrations for 10 years or 15 years.

We think this one was the worst: As Turkey attacked Kurdish areas of northeast Syria, Trump said, ""In the meantime, our soldiers are not in harm's way -- as they shouldn't be -- as two countries fight over land that has nothing to do with us. And the Kurds are much safer right now, but the Kurds know how to fight.""

The Kurds were obviously not at all safer.

The most revealing false claim: Obama and HIV/AIDS

Near the end of his rally speeches, Trump usually repeats a scripted promise about how his administration is going to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the US in 10 years or less.

In Dallas, he attached something new to the pledge: a groundless attack on his predecessor.

""The previous administration spent no money on that,"" he said.

Trump has seemed particularly fixated on former President Barack Obama over the last two weeks, baselessly suggesting there is something nefarious about Obama's post-presidency deal with Netflix and making things up about Obama's dealings with North Korea.

The HIV/AIDS claim was not even close to true. The Obama administration spent billions on anti-HIV/AIDS efforts -- $10.8 billion on domestic HIV/AIDS research between the 2013 fiscal year and 2016 fiscal year alone, according to a review by the Kaiser Family Foundation, plus $85.1 billion more on domestic HIV/AIDS care, housing and prevention programs in those four years, plus $26 billion on global programs over the same period.

The most absurd false claim: The Gloria story

Trump lies for strategic purposes, systematically attempting to reframe reality to his own political advantage. He also just says little incorrect things for no particular reason because he doesn't care to check if they're true.

Welcoming the Stanley Cup champion St. Louis Blues to the White House on October 15, Trump told the fun story about how the 1982 Laura Branigan hit ""Gloria"" became the team's victory song in 2019. He explained, reading from a text, that it all started when the Blues beat the Philadelphia Flyers in January. He added the Flyers ""were hot"" at the time.

The Flyers had lost six consecutive games.

Here is this week's full list of 87, starting with the ones we haven't included in a weekly update before:

The Ukraine scandal and impeachment

Ukraine and ""the server""

""Where is the server? I want to see the server. Let's see what's on the server. So, the server, they say, is held by a company whose primary ownership individual is from Ukraine. I'd like to see the server."" -- October 16 exchange with reporters at meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: Trump appeared to be referring to : Trump appeared to be referring to CrowdStrike , a publicly traded cybersecurity firm that was hired to investigate the hack of DNC servers in 2016. The company was co-founded by Dmitri Alperovitch, an American citizen who was born in Russia , not Ukraine. There is no evidence that any physical DNC server is currently being ""held"" by CrowdStrike.

CrowdStrike -- which, like former special counsel Robert Mueller, attributed the hack to Russia -- said in a previous statement: ""With regards to our investigation of the DNC hack in 2016, we provided all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI. As we've stated before, we stand by our findings and conclusions that have been fully supported by the US Intelligence community.""

Tom Bossert, Trump's former homeland security adviser, said on ABC in September that he was frustrated by the ""conspiracy theory,"" adding: ""It's not only a conspiracy theory. It is completely debunked.""

CrowdStrike has been hired by Republicans as well as Democrats. It has been paid during Trump's presidency by the National Republican Congressional Committee and National Republican Senatorial Committee, public records show.

Schiff's immunity

""I understand he has immunity, but he doesn't have immunity when he puts it on his Twitter, which he did."" -- October 18 teleconference with participants of first all-female spacewalk on International Space Station

Facts First: The constitutional provision that gives Schiff immunity from prosecution over his comments in a congressional committee hearing also gives him immunity over his tweet of a video of those comments, experts say.

As the Congressional Research Service explains , the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause has been interpreted ""to include all 'legislative acts' undertaken by Members or their aides,"" including their committee activities.

""The protection clearly extends to the offending Tweets,"" said William Banks, a law professor at Syracuse University.

Republicans and impeachment

""Republicans are totally deprived of their rights in this Impeachment Witch Hunt. No lawyers, no questions, no transparency!"" -- October 16 tweet

Facts First: As CNN senior congressional correspondent Manu Raju : As CNN senior congressional correspondent Manu Raju noted last week, ""Republicans have been able to ask questions to all the witnesses in the closed-door depositions. Each side alternates and asks questions, and the depositions have lasted roughly 8-10 hours.""

Republicans do not have guaranteed ""rights"" to call or cross-examine witnesses as part of an impeachment process in the House of Representatives. A president who has been impeached cannot be removed from office without a trial in the Senate, but the House does not need to hold anything like a trial before doing the impeaching.

A quote from Jason Chaffetz

""'Because the House has already voted against the Impeachment Proceeding, the current inquiry is totally invalid. The current sham of a so-called investigation is nothing more than an unconstitutional power grab. It needs to end.' @JasonChaffetz @seanhannity Corrupt Adam Schiff"" -- October 18 tweet

Facts First: We give Trump latitude to make minor errors when he is quoting people, but we think it counts as a false claim when he makes changes and omissions that significantly alter the meaning of the quote. In this case, Trump left out an important qualifier from Chaffetz, the former Republican congressman.

Chaffetz actually said the following: ""Because the House has already voted against an impeachment proceeding, the current inquiry is totally invalid unless another formal vote is held."" Trump left out the ""unless another formal vote is held"" -- thus erasing Chaffetz's suggestion that the inquiry could become valid in the future.

The whistleblowers being 'all gone'

""Where is the Whistleblower, or the 2nd Whistleblower, or the 'informant?' All gone because their so-called story didn't come even close to matching up with the exact transcript of the phone call."" -- October 20 tweet

Facts First: There is no evidence that either the first whistleblower (who filed the complaint about Trump's dealings with Ukraine) or the second whistleblower (whose lawyer : There is no evidence that either the first whistleblower (who filed the complaint about Trump's dealings with Ukraine) or the second whistleblower (whose lawyer said they have first-hand information corroborating claims made by the first whistleblower) are now somehow ""gone,"" let alone that they are ""gone"" because of the first whistleblower was shown to be inaccurate.

""The whistleblowers have not vanished,"" Bradley Moss, a colleague of Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the two whistleblowers, said on Twitter.

Paul Ryan and subpoenas

""And the Republicans have been treated very unfairly by the Democrats. I'll say this: Paul Ryan would never issue a subpoena. I don't say right or wrong. He wouldn't do it. He had too much respect for our country."" -- October 16 exchange with reporters at meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: As FactCheck.org : As FactCheck.org noted , numerous Republican subpoenas were issued to the Obama administration during Paul Ryan's tenure as Speaker of the House.

A Fox News poll

""The Fox Impeachment poll has turned out to be incorrect. This was announced on Friday. Despite this, the Corrupt New York Times used this poll in one of its stories, no mention of the correction which they knew about full well! 'Fox News Pollster Braun Research Misrepresented Impeachment Poll: Analysis' @NYPost"" -- October 14 tweet

""Just another FAKE SUPPRESSION POLL, this time from @FoxNews, of course!"" -- October 19 tweet

Facts First: There was no announcement that the : There was no announcement that the poll -- which found 51% support for impeaching and removing Trump -- was ""incorrect."" Trump may have been referring to the New York Post article that criticized the poll, but that is far from the official announcement Trump seemed to be suggesting exists. And there is no evidence that the poll was intentionally designed to suppress Trump's support.

It's also worth noting that the Post, and Trump in quoting the Post, misidentified the pollster. The poll was jointly conducted by Democratic firm Beacon Research and Republican firm Shaw & Company Research. Braun Research was hired to do the fieldwork of contacting the participants; it did not design the poll.

Dana Blanton, Fox News vice president of public opinion research, said in a statement to CNN: ""Our polling unit has long been held in high regard for being a nonpartisan source of research. Under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), the latest FNC poll included interviews with randomly chosen registered voters and -- as is our standard practice -- we reported the partisan distribution we found among the electorate. Braun Research is solely our data collection partner. We stand by our latest poll.""

Turkey and Syria

A quote from Mark Esper

""'The ceasefire is holding up very nicely. There are some minor skirmishes that have ended quickly. New areas being resettled with Kurds. U.S. soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zone. We have secured the Oil.' Mark Esper, Secretary of Defense. Ending endless wars!"" -- October 20 tweet

Facts First: This was the second version of this tweet; the first, which Trump deleted, wrongly referred to Mark Esper as ""Mark Esperanto."" The second version of the tweet, however, was also incorrect: Esper did not say all of the words Trump attributed to him, at least not in public.

Esper had told reporters en route to Afghanistan: ""Well, I think overall the ceasefire generally seems to be holding. We see a stabilization of the lines, if you will, on the ground. And we do get reports of intermittent fires, this and that. It doesn't surprise me necessarily. But that's what we're picking up.""

The transcript shows no Esper comments about oil or Kurds. Idrees Ali, a Reuters reporter traveling with Esper, said there were no such comments.

Trump has a history of misusing or sloppily using quotation marks, repeatedly inserting his own comments into supposed quotes from other people without distinguishing between the two.

The deal with Turkey

""This outcome is something they've been trying to get for 10 years -- everybody -- and they couldn't get it, other administrations. And they never would've been able to get it unless you went somewhat unconventional. I guess I'm an unconventional person."" And: ""We've tried -- we have tried, but everybody has tried to make this deal for 15 years."" And: ""Because the conventional solution is to sit down, negotiate, and they've done that for 15 years. Actually more than that, I understand. And that was never going to work."" -- October 17 exchange with reporters upon Air Force One arrival in Texas

""This is a great day for civilization. I am proud of the United States for sticking by me in following a necessary, but somewhat unconventional, path. People have been trying to make this 'Deal' for many years."" -- October 17 tweet

""...it was unconventional, but they fought for a few days and it was pretty vicious -- the Kurds, who are our friends; Turkey's our friend; but they fought. It was tougher, I mean it was nasty, and you couldn't make a deal for 15, think of it, for 15 years, 20 years, they couldn't make a deal."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

""This is a deal that should have been made 15 years ago, 10 years ago, over the last number of years, under the Obama administration."" -- October 18 exchange with reporters at teleconference with participants of first all-female spacewalk on International Space Station

Facts First: Trump's claims are baseless to the point of being nonsensical. The deal is a narrow agreement specifically tied to the Turkish offensive that followed Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from a Kurdish-held region of northern Syria, not an agreement that resolves longstanding regional disputes. Further, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush never sought to give Turkey anything like the concessionary terms of Trump's deal. In addition, the Syrian civil war had not even started 10 years ago or 15 years ago.

Soldiers being withdrawn from Syria

""We're bringing our soldiers back home, and we've done a great job."" -- October 16 press conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: The soldiers are not being brought ""home,"" at least not yet. Trump : The soldiers are not being brought ""home,"" at least not yet. Trump announced last Monday that ""United States troops coming out of Syria will now redeploy and remain in the region to monitor the situation and prevent a repeat of 2014, when the neglected threat of ISIS raged across Syria and Iraq."" He also announced that 1,800 more troops would be deployed to Saudi Arabia.

Erdogan's comments

Question: ""Are you okay with (Turkish President Recep Tayyip) Erdogan saying that he is not going to do a ceasefire?"" Trump: ""He didn't say that at all. He's meeting. And he's meeting today with some of our representatives."" -- October 16 exchange with reporters at meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: Erdogan had indeed said that: ""'Declare a ceasefire, they say.' We will never declare a ceasefire,"" Erdogan : Erdogan had indeed said that: ""'Declare a ceasefire, they say.' We will never declare a ceasefire,"" Erdogan told reporters on October 15.

The Kurds' safety

""In the meantime, our soldiers are not in harm's way -- as they shouldn't be -- as two countries fight over land that has nothing to do with us. And the Kurds are much safer right now, but the Kurds know how to fight."" -- October 16 exchange with reporters at meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: It is clearly not true that the Kurds were safer ""right now"" -- after US troops vacated their positions in northern Syria, after Turkey began its bombardment and before a ceasefire was announced -- than they had been before. More than 160,000 Kurds were : It is clearly not true that the Kurds were safer ""right now"" -- after US troops vacated their positions in northern Syria, after Turkey began its bombardment and before a ceasefire was announced -- than they had been before. More than 160,000 Kurds were displaced by the Turkish offensive, according to the United Nations.

The Kurdish Red Crescent said in a Monday statement: ""Since the ceasefire, we documented 21 civilians dead and 27 injured."" The Red Crescent said the total would rise.

The PKK and ISIS

""Now, the PKK, which is a part of the Kurds, as you know, is probably worse at terror and more of terrorist threat, in many ways, than ISIS."" -- October 16 press conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: Though the US government does consider the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) a terrorist entity, the government and independent experts consider ISIS as a much more dangerous and much more global threat. ISIS has also undertaken many more attacks.

""The PKK is a domestic Turkish terrorist organization that's focused exclusively on its struggle for Kurdish independence from Turkey,"" said Bryan Gibson, an expert on Kurdistan and assistant professor of history at Hawaii Pacific University. ""It has never posed a threat to the US nor has it specifically targeted Americans...ISIS is a global terrorist organization, which has specifically targeted Americans in terrorist attacks, fought a war with the US, and continues to pose a clear and present danger to Americans at home and abroad.""

As The New York Times reported , a database of terror attacks maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland counts 2,455 PKK attacks since the organization was founded in 1978 -- versus 6,451 attacks by the Islamic State ""since it became formally known by its name in 2013."" In 2018, the consortium counted 122 attacks and 136 deaths from the PKK versus 735 attacks and 2,221 deaths from ISIS.

The Times also noted: ""The State Department's latest annual terrorism report contains over 500 references (to) ISIS, including a lengthy introduction assessing its influence in the region, compared with under 30 mentions of the PKK.""

Hurricane Harvey

Relief money for Texas

Touting the ""billions and billions of dollars"" in relief money he authorized for Texas in the wake of Hurricane Harvey in 2017 -- and teasing Texas lawmakers over their requests for him to spend more -- Trump said, ""You made a fortune on the hurricane."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: Texas did not make money from Hurricane Harvey.

Harvey created costs of $125 billion, the federal government estimates. As of Wednesday, the government says Texas has been allocated $26.6 billion in federal disaster funds since 2017.

The Texas Department of Insurance estimated in April that personal and commercial insurance payouts related to Harvey would total $19.6 billion.

Aside from the personal toll of the disaster, which killed dozens of people, thousands of Texas residents have suffered severe financial losses from which they have not recovered.

Coast Guard rescues

Trump said of Hurricane Harvey: ""Our Coast Guard saved 16,000 lives."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: The Coast Guard : The Coast Guard says the correct number is 11,022 people rescued.

Democrats

The Bidens

Trump conflated his accusations against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter -- railing against Hunter Biden's business dealings, then saying that Joe Biden ""takes a billion-five"" from China and ""he goes on and he allows China to rip us off."" He added, ""So the Bidens got rich while America got robbed."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: There is no evidence Joe Biden has received large sums of money from China or has otherwise gained wealth as a result of his son's business dealings abroad.

Trump has previously made the ""billion-five"" accusation against Hunter Biden. While a conservative author has used this figure, it has not been proven. A lawyer for Hunter Biden, George Mesires, says the investment company in which Hunter Biden has an equity stake was capitalized with a total of about $4.2 million at today's exchange rates, ""not $1.5 billion."" Even this investment was not a direct payment to Hunter Biden; He holds a 10% stake in the firm, Mesires says , and has not made a profit to date.

Obama and AIDS

""We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America in less than 10 years -- we're doing that. Who would have believed we could do that? We're doing that. And the previous administration spent no money on that..."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: The Obama administration spent $10.8 billion on domestic HIV/AIDS research between the 2013 fiscal year and 2016 fiscal year alone, according to a : The Obama administration spent $10.8 billion on domestic HIV/AIDS research between the 2013 fiscal year and 2016 fiscal year alone, according to a review by the Kaiser Family Foundation, and $85.1 billion more on domestic HIV/AIDS care, housing and prevention programs in those four years. It also spent $26 billion on international HIV/AIDS initiatives of various kinds over the same time period.

Democrats and undocumented immigrants

Trump noted that all of the 10 Democratic presidential candidates at a debate in June raised their hand to say they would extend health care coverage to undocumented immigrants, then claimed that the Democrats ""want to give more to illegal aliens than they give to American citizens."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: The Democrats want to give these immigrants the same access to care that citizens have, not more.

Dallas crowds

The crowd outside his Dallas rally

""...outside, they have close to 30,000 people. And I wonder if I could ask the fire marshal, fill up this little area, let 'em in."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: Trump's estimate was way off. ""We didn't have 30K outside. Probably had upward of 5K outside,"" Dallas Police Department spokesman Sgt. Mitchell Warren told CNN in an email.

The crowd inside the Dallas rally

""And by the way, I have to say this. So outside, they have close to 30,000 people, and I wonder if I could ask the fire marshal: fill up this little area, let 'em in. You know, they have a certain max. We broke the record tonight."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: Trump did not break the attendance record at the American Airlines Center. Jason Evans, a spokesman for the Dallas Fire-Rescue Department, told CNN that the fire department and the arena calculated an attendance of 18,500. The Dallas Mavericks, who play in the arena, had an average announced attendance of 20,013 per game last season, among the highest in the NBA, according to ESPN : Trump did not break the attendance record at the American Airlines Center. Jason Evans, a spokesman for the Dallas Fire-Rescue Department, told CNN that the fire department and the arena calculated an attendance of 18,500.

Economy, trade and international affairs

Iran's economy

""I think we're in a very good position in the Middle East. I think we're very, very strong in the Middle East. Iran is going to hell; their economy is in deep trouble. Their GDP went down 20%, which nobody ever even heard of before. Probably 25%."" -- October 16 exchange with reporters at meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. While Iran's economy is shrinking, the Statistical Center of Iran : Trump was exaggerating. While Iran's economy is shrinking, the Statistical Center of Iran reported that the country's GDP fell by 4.9% in the year 2018-2019.

Experts say there is no apparent basis for Trump's ""20%"" and ""25%"" figures even though Iran's official economic data is less reliable than official data in the US.

""It's still not iron-clad stuff, but if the situation was anywhere near 25% decline then the official stats would at least be in the teens. This is also why folks cross-check these numbers with independent and global institutional data (such as IMF's). My suspicion is that it's closer to 13-15% decrease, which still puts it a good 10% points below Trump's claim,"" Hussein Banai, an assistant professor who studies Iran at Indiana University's School of International Studies, said in an email.

The International Monetary Fund expects a 9.5% contraction in Iran's economy this year -- down from an earlier estimate of a 6% contraction, but still not 20% or 25%. The World Bank forecasts an 8.7% contraction in the 2019-2020 period.

Stock market participation

""If you look at people's stocks, their 401(k)s, if you look at anything you want to look at, they're far better off now than they probably ever have been in this country. Record stock markets. And don't forget, stock market is not just rich people. It's all people. Because all people own in the stock markets."" -- October 16 exchange with reporters at meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: Trump was right that it's not only rich people who own stocks, but it's not true that ""all"" people own stocks. Roughly : Trump was right that it's not only rich people who own stocks, but it's not true that ""all"" people own stocks. Roughly half of Americans owned stocks as of 2017, according to academic studies and polls.

Wealthy people own a disproportionate share of stocks. A 2017 paper by New York University economist Edward Wolff found that the top 10% of households owned 84% of stocks in 2016.

The Soviet Union's 'downsizing'

""You know, Russia was involved in Afghanistan. It used to be called the Soviet Union -- now it's called Russia for a reason. Because they lost so much money in Afghanistan that they had to downsize. A very big downsizing."" -- October 16 exchange with reporters at meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: This was an exaggeration. Experts say the Soviet Union's failed war in Afghanistan was far from the only reason for its collapse, though it did contribute to it. (We'll ignore Trump's use of the term ""downsizing"" to describe the dissolution of the Soviet Union.)

Louis Vuitton

""And they're opening up a plant in Texas. The first time, I believe -- one of the great companies of the world -- first time ever in the United States."" -- October 17 exchange with reporters upon Air Force One arrival in Texas

Facts First: The Louis Vuitton workshop Trump visited in Texas is the company's third workshop in the United States. It also has : The Louis Vuitton workshop Trump visited in Texas is the company's third workshop in the United States. It also has two in California.

US tariff history

Trump boasted about a World Trade Organization decision to allow the US to impose $7.5 billion in tariffs on European countries in response to their subsidies to airplane manufacturer Airbus.

""We're winning, in the case of the European Union, $7.5 billion. And Italy has a percentage of that to pay. And, in the -- in other cases, we've won. And we have a lot of money coming into the United States for the first time ever. Tremendous amounts of money in many different forms, including tariffs."" -- October 16 exchange with reporters at meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: This is nonsensical. This is clearly not the first time the US has had tariff revenue; the US generated $32 billion from tariffs in 2016, the last full year before Trump's presidency, according to the : This is nonsensical. This is clearly not the first time the US has had tariff revenue; the US generated $32 billion from tariffs in 2016, the last full year before Trump's presidency, according to the Congressional Research Service , and $41.6 billion in the 2018 fiscal year, according to Customs and Border Protection

Trump was wrong even if he was talking specifically about tariffs authorized by the WTO. ""Airbus is not the only case where 'retaliation' was authorized and US tariffs went into effect,"" said Dan Ikenson, director of the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. Ikenson pointed to the case of hormone-treated beef, in which the WTO approved retaliatory tariffs the US imposed in 1999.

Trade deficits

""And we lose, for many years, $500 billion a year with China and many other countries, we lose billions. We lose with everybody -- but that's all changing now."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: ""We lose with everybody"" is an exaggeration, even going by Trump's disputed characterization of trade deficits as ""losses."" While the US did have an : ""We lose with everybody"" is an exaggeration, even going by Trump's disputed characterization of trade deficits as ""losses."" While the US did have an overall trade deficit with the world in 2018, it had surpluses with multiple countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, Canada and Singapore, according to US government data.

We explain in a separate item that the US has never had a $500 billion trade deficit with China.

The media and the G7

""So interesting that, when I announced Trump National Doral in Miami would be used for the hosting of the G-7, and then rescinded due to Do Nothing Democrat/Fake News Anger, very few in Media mentioned that NO PROFITS would be taken, or would be given FREE, if legally permissible!"" -- October 20 tweet

""I thought I was doing something very good for our Country by using Trump National Doral, in Miami, for hosting the G-7 Leaders...I announced that I would be willing to do it at NO PROFIT or, if legally permissible, at ZERO COST to the USA. But, as usual, the Hostile Media & their Democrat Partners went CRAZY!"" -- October 19 tweet

Facts First: Numerous news outlets reported the White House's claim that Trump would not make a profit on a G7 summit held at his resort. (CNN's article, for example, : Numerous news outlets reported the White House's claim that Trump would not make a profit on a G7 summit held at his resort. (CNN's article, for example, quoted acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney as saying, ""Trump will not be profiting in 'any way, shape or form'""; the New York Times article said , ""Mr. Mulvaney said the hotel would put on the summit 'at cost.' 'I think the president has pretty much made it very clear since he got here that he doesn't profit from being here,' he said. 'He has no interest in profit from being here.'"")

News outlets did not report that anything would be ""given FREE"" because Mulvaney and White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham used the phrase "" at cost ,"" not ""free"" or ""zero cost.""

The 2016 election

Facebook and the election

""And I'm no fan of those companies. They were against me. Somebody said I lost maybe two million votes, maybe more, because of Facebook."" -- October 16 press conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: Trump appeared to be referring to a flawed study that dubiously alleged that Google bias was sufficiently bad to have shifted at least 2.6 million votes away from Trump in the 2016 presidential election. While the author, Robert Epstein, did criticize Facebook in congressional testimony in July, he did not find that Facebook cost Trump 2 million votes. You can read a longer fact check about this study : Trump appeared to be referring to a flawed study that dubiously alleged that Google bias was sufficiently bad to have shifted at least 2.6 million votes away from Trump in the 2016 presidential election. While the author, Robert Epstein, did criticize Facebook in congressional testimony in July, he did not find that Facebook cost Trump 2 million votes. You can read a longer fact check about this study here

Trump was vague, saying that ""somebody"" said he had lost 2 million votes or more, so it is possible he was referring to something else. Regardless, there is no evidence for the claim that he lost millions of votes because of some nefarious acts by social media companies.

The number of Republican candidates

""I never debated, my whole life has been a debate, but I never debated like with a podium and this and that. So, I said who are they? And we had 17 people plus me. We had 18, it was actually not 17, it was 18, remember? Gilmore, nobody remembers him but we had 18 people."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: There were : There were 17 candidates in the early Republican primary debates in 2015, including Jim Gilmore, the former Virginia governor.

We usually ignore it when Trump says there were 18, since he was off by only one, but we're flagging it here because Trump specifically rejected the accurate number, 17.

'Corruption'

Trump recited his usual complaints about how he was treated by US intelligence officials involved in investigating his campaign's relationship with Russia. He added: ""There was a lot of corruption. Maybe it goes right up to President Obama. I happen to think it does."" -- October 16 press conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: There is simply no evidence of Obama corruption.

Women in space

""Joining us during their spacewalk outside the International Space Station -- and this is the first time for a woman outside of the Space Station -- are Flight Engineers Christina Koch and Flight Engineer Jessica Meir."" -- October 18 teleconference with participants of first all-female spacewalk on International Space Station

Facts First: Trump was immediately fact checked by Meir, who noted that this is not ""the first time for a woman outside of the Space Station.""

Meir said: ""Thank you. First -- first of all, we don't want to take too much credit, because there have been many other female spacewalkers before us. This is just the first time that there have been two women outside at the same time.""

The Internal Revenue Service

""I will never allow the IRS to be used as a political weapon -- except in the case of myself, where they use it against me."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: There is no basis for Trump's claim that he is allowing the IRS to be used against himself. The IRS is run by a Trump appointee, Charles Rettig, and there is no evidence it is being used against Trump; Democrats are seeking access to his tax returns, but that is not the same thing.

The St. Louis Blues and Philadelphia Flyers

""But they (the Blues) gathered at a bar in Philadelphia where they heard the 1982 hit, 'Gloria.' That's where you were -- that's why we were playing that song, for those of you that don't know what's happened here. 'Gloria.' The next day, you shut out the Flyers, who were hot, and 'Gloria' became your new 'win song.'"" -- October 15 speech at ceremony for Stanley Cup champions St. Louis Blues

Facts First: We realize this sounds silly, but since we count each and every Trump false claim no matter how little, we must note that he was the opposite of correct when he said the Flyers were ""hot"" at the time the Blues faced them on January 7. The Flyers were on a : We realize this sounds silly, but since we count each and every Trump false claim no matter how little, we must note that he was the opposite of correct when he said the Flyers were ""hot"" at the time the Blues faced them on January 7. The Flyers were on a six-game losing streak

Here are the claims Trump made last week that we have previously fact checked in one of these weekly roundups:

The Ukraine scandal

The accuracy of the whistleblower

Trump claimed six times last week, in tweets and public remarks, that the whistleblower's account of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was highly inaccurate -- calling the whistleblower's claims ""sooo wrong, not even close,"" ""so far from the facts,"" and ""totally different from the actual transcribed call.""

Facts First: The whistleblower's account of the call has largely been proven accurate. In fact, the rough transcript released by Trump himself showed that the whistleblower's three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct.

You can read a full fact check here

The timeline of Schiff's comments

""So he (Adam Schiff) made up a totally false conversation with the Ukrainian President, and we caught him cold. Everybody knew it anyway. See? We did one thing -- you always have to do the unexpected. They never thought I'd release the conversation with the Ukrainian President."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: Schiff delivered his : Schiff delivered his rendition of Trump's call the day after Trump released the transcript, not before. Trump initially recounted the timeline correctly, then adopted this incorrect timeline.

The legality of Schiff's comments

""Hope all House Republicans, and honest House Democrats, will vote to CENSURE Rep. Adam Schiff tomorrow for his brazen and unlawful act of fabricating (making up) a totally phony conversation with the Ukraine President and U.S. President, me. Most have never seen such a thing!"" -- October 16 tweet

Facts First: While it's fair for Trump to be miffed about Schiff's comments -- Schiff's mix of near-quotes from Trump, his own analysis, and supposed ""parody"" was at the very least confusing -- Schiff's words were not illegal.

Again, the Constitution includes a specific provision that allows members of Congress to speak freely during official meetings.

The rough transcript

Trump twice claimed that he had released an ""exact"" transcript of his call with Zelensky.

Facts First: The document released by the White House explicitly : The document released by the White House explicitly says , on the first page, that it is not an exact transcript of the call.

""A Memorandum of a Telephone Conversation (TELCON) is not a verbatim transcript of a discussion. The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place. A number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record, including poor telecommunications connections and variations in accent and/or interpretation,"" the document says.

Immigration

Democrats and the wall

""Democrats always liked Walls, until I built them. Do you see what's happening here?"" -- October 17 tweet

""And you know five years ago, almost every one of them (Democrats) wanted a wall."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: Democrats did support Republican demands for fencing in the comprehensive immigration reform bill six years ago, but that was fencing -- and Democrats agreed to endorse it only in exchange for Republican support for their own preferred policies, like a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

The wall

""...the WALL is being built!"" -- October 14 tweet

""We're building a great wall along the southern border and it's going up rapidly."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: As of September 30, no additional miles of border wall had been built during Trump's presidency in places where barriers had not existed before, according to a fact sheet from Customs and Border Protection. Over Trump's tenure in office, 69 miles of barriers had been constructed in places where ""dilapidated and outdated"" barriers had existed before; that's a pace of about half a mile of replacement barrier per week.

Trump said three times that the Democrats support ""open borders.""

Democrats and borders

Facts First: Even 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests.

Mexican troops

""Mexico, today, had 27,000 soldiers on our border and we've stopped this horrible migration of people..."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: Mexico has deployed a substantial number of troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular. Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan told reporters in September that 10,000 of the approximately 25,000 Mexican troops deployed were on Mexico's own southern border: ""They've created a new national guard within their country: 10,000 troops to the southern border; 15,000 troops to the northern border with the United States,"" he : Mexico has deployed a substantial number of troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular. Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan told reporters in September that 10,000 of the approximately 25,000 Mexican troops deployed were on Mexico's own southern border: ""They've created a new national guard within their country: 10,000 troops to the southern border; 15,000 troops to the northern border with the United States,"" he said

Trade and China

The World Trade Organization

""I think the WTO award has been testament to a lot of good work by the Trump administration. We never won with the WTO, or essentially never won. Very seldom did we win. And now we're winning a lot. We're winning a lot because they know if we're not treated fairly, we're leaving."" And: ""But the WTO -- that's the World Trade Organization -- has been very unfair to the United States. They know I feel that way, and I think since they know I feel that way, all of a sudden, we're starting to win very big awards."" -- October 16 exchange with reporters at meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

""We didn't win any cases at the WTO...And we won a lot of cases lately, we didn't win anything for years, practically."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: The US has long won cases at the World Trade Organization, and there is no evidence that WTO adjudicators have suddenly changed their behavior toward the US. While Trump's administration took over the 15-year-old Airbus case in 2017, the latest US victory in that case in particular was only the most recent in a series of wins that dates : The US has long won cases at the World Trade Organization, and there is no evidence that WTO adjudicators have suddenly changed their behavior toward the US. While Trump's administration took over the 15-year-old Airbus case in 2017, the latest US victory in that case in particular was only the most recent in a series of wins that dates back to the early Obama administration.

Contrary to Trump's repeated assertion, the US has long been successful in WTO disputes -- his own Council of Economic Advisers said in a report in February 2018 that the US had won 86% of the cases it has brought since 1995. The global average was 84% and China's figure 67%, according to the council.

As is standard for the WTO, the US has tended to lose cases where it is defending the case rather than bringing it -- but even in those cases, Trump's advisers noted that the US did better (a 25% victory rate) than the world average (17%) or China's rate (just 5%).

A Bloomberg Law review in March found that the US success rate in cases it brings to the WTO had increased very slightly since Trump took office, from 84.8% in 2016 to 85.4%.

China's economic history

""And China became rich because of the WTO. That's when China really ascended. That's when China went up. That's when they made their great rise. They were flatlining, and then, all of a sudden, around the year 2000, 2001, when they got involved with the WTO, it became a whole different story."" -- October 16 exchange with reporters at meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: China's economy was not ""flatlining"" before it became a member of the World Trade Organization in late 2001. China had experienced significant growth for years prior.

According to World Bank figures , China grew by 7.7% in 1999, 8.5% in 2000 and 8.3% in 2001. It then grew by 9.1% in 2002, 10.0% in 2003 and 10.1% in 2004. Its post-WTO growth peaked at 14.2% in 2007 -- almost identical to its growth in 1992.

Nicholas Lardy of the Peterson Institute for International Economics wrote in 2008: ""China has been the fastest growing economy in the world over almost three decades, expanding at 10 per cent per year in real terms."" In an email to CNN in July, when Trump made another version of this comment, Lardy said, ""Uninformed would be the best characterization of the President's comment.""

China's economic performance

""They've (China) had the worst year they've had in 27 years and we're having the best year we've ever had, so that's good, that's good."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

""And they're having the worst year they've had in 57 years."" -- October 18 exchange with reporters at teleconference with participants of first all-female spacewalk on International Space Station

Facts First: The US is not having its best economic year ever by the metric by which China is having its worst year in 27 years.

China's second-quarter GDP growth of 6.2% and third-quarter GDP growth of 6% were its worst since 1992, 27 years ago . US second-quarter growth was 2%, lower than in the same quarter of 2018 and 2017.

Who is paying the tariffs

""We've taken in tens of billions of dollars of tariffs and China's eating the cost, because they devalued their currency..."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: A bevy of : A bevy of economic studies has found that Americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs, and Americans make the actual tariff payments.

China's agricultural spending

""So I hear the most the farmers ever did (in business with China) was $16 billion, so I said, 'Ask for 70.' They said, 'No, you don't mean 70. Sixteen.' 'Ask for 70.'"" -- October 15 speech at ceremony for Stanley Cup champions St. Louis Blues

""The most they ever did was $20 billion of product from our farmers, our great farmers, our patriot farmers."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: China spent $25.9 billion on American agricultural products in 2012, according to figures from the Department of Agriculture.

The trade deficit with China

Trump said twice that the US has a $500 billion trade deficit with China.

Facts First: Through 2018, there has never been a $500 billion trade deficit with China. The 2018 deficit was : Through 2018, there has never been a $500 billion trade deficit with China. The 2018 deficit was $381 billion last year when counting goods and services, $420 billion when counting goods alone.

The trade deficit with the European Union

""They do very well with us on trade. They had a trade surplus with the United States, over the last five or six years, of about $150 billion a year."" He added that the US deficit ""could even be"" $178 billion. -- October 16 press conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: The trade : The trade deficit with the European Union was $114.6 billion in 2018, $101.2 billion in 2017 and $92.5 billion in 2016.

The deficit was $169.6 billion in 2018 if you only count trade in goods and ignore trade in services. But Trump, as usual, failed to specify that he was using this more limited measure.

Military affairs

Military spending

""Our military has been completely rebuilt...We spent two and a half trillion dollars rebuilding it over the last three years."" -- October 16 exchange with reporters at meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

""We've invested more than $2.5 trillion restoring our armed forces..."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: Defense spending for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 was $2.05 trillion, and that includes more than three-and-a-half months of Obama's tenure, since the 2017 fiscal year began in October 2016.

Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he thinks Trump must have been including military funding for the 2020 fiscal year to get to the ""$2.5 trillion"" figure -- but the 2020 fiscal year has just started, and Harrison noted that the defense appropriation has not yet been approved by Congress.

The nuclear arsenal

""Our nuclear has been totally updated and in some cases new."" -- October 16 press conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: Experts say that Trump has not yet implemented significant changes to the US nuclear arsenal. ""I am not aware that Trump can claim to have done anything for the state of the nuclear arsenal -- but nothing urgent needed to be done anyway,"" said Scott Kemp, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Nuclear Security and Policy, who served as a State Department adviser on arms control early in the Obama administration.

NATO contributions

""And I want to just thank Secretary General Stoltenberg because he is going around saying that President Trump was able to raise over $100 billion last year, which is true."" -- October 16 press conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: This is at least a slight exaggeration -- and one Stoltenberg gently tried to correct when he met with Trump in April. Though Stoltenberg has indeed given Trump credit for pressuring NATO countries into boosting spending, he has said, to Trump and in other forums, that the extra $100 billion the countries will spend on their own militaries will come by the : This is at least a slight exaggeration -- and one Stoltenberg gently tried to correct when he met with Trump in April. Though Stoltenberg has indeed given Trump credit for pressuring NATO countries into boosting spending, he has said, to Trump and in other forums, that the extra $100 billion the countries will spend on their own militaries will come by the end of 2020 , not that it happened ""last year.""

Veterans Choice

""We passed for the veterans VA Choice and VA Accountability on behalf of those great people. They've been trying to pass it from us 50 years, they couldn't get it done. But those guys right there and me, we got it done."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: Obama : Obama signed the Choice program into law in 2014. Trump signed a law in 2018, the VA MISSION Act, to expand and change the program.

A timeline for Syria

""But we were supposed to be there for 30 days; we stayed for 10 years."" -- October 16 exchange with reporters at meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

""We were supposed to be in Syria for one month. That was 10 years ago."" -- October 16 press conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

""And, by the way, we have the strongest military in the world. But we've been there for 10 years."" -- October 17 exchange with reporters upon Air Force One arrival in Texas

Facts First: There was never any specific timeline for the US military's involvement in Syria, much less a timeline of a mere 30 days. The US began bombing Syria in 2014 and deployed ground troops : There was never any specific timeline for the US military's involvement in Syria, much less a timeline of a mere 30 days. The US began bombing Syria in 2014 and deployed ground troops in 2015 -- five years ago and four years ago, not 10 years ago.

""There was never a 30-day timetable on the US presence in Syria,"" said Syria expert Steven Heydemann, a professor of government and director of the Middle East Studies program at Smith College. ""The previous administration, and officials serving in this administration, have never offered a fixed timetable for the US mission. Official statements have emphasized that the presence of US forces would be short, limited in scope, and small. But beyond general comments along those lines, there has been no statement indicating it would end after 30 days.""

News outlets including The New York Times reported in mid-2012 that a small number of CIA officers were on the ground in Turkey to help policymakers decide how to arm the opposition to Syria's government, so you can make a reasonable argument that US involvement goes back more than seven years. Still, ""10 years ago"" remains an exaggeration.

Accomplishments, promises and popualrity

Approval with Republicans

""95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you!"" -- October 16 tweet

""95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party!"" -- October 17 tweet

Facts First: Trump's approval rating among Republicans is very high, regularly in the 80s and sometimes creeping into the 90s, but it has not been 95% in any recent major poll we could find.

Trump was at 88% with Republicans in a Quinnipiac University poll conducted from October 11-13, 84% in an Ipsos/Reuters poll conducted October 14-15, and 87% in Gallup data gathered from October 1 to 13.

Pre-existing conditions

""We will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: We usually don't fact-check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward : We usually don't fact-check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump is currently supporting a Republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of Obamacare void. He has not issued a plan to reinstate the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions if the suit succeeds.

The unemployment rate

""Last month, unemployment reached its lowest level in 51 years."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: The September : The September rate , 3.5%, was the lowest since December 1969, just under 50 years ago.

Ivanka Trump and jobs

""Even though they're related to me, just slightly, I will tell you, what a job. Ivanka is responsible for 14 million jobs this year, over the last couple of years, with companies going out and training people. And it's been an incredible success. She started off two and a half years ago; she wanted 500,000 jobs. That's a lot. But it was typical Ivanka. It ended up -- and now, the number, I think it just crossed 14 million jobs going to Walmart, going to ExxonMobil, going to the great companies. And they train people. And the numbers are incredible, and that's one of the reasons that our numbers are so good."" -- October 17 speech at opening of Louis Vuitton workshop in Alvarado, Texas

Facts First: Given that fewer than 6.5 million jobs had been created during the entire Trump presidency through September, Ivanka Trump, the President's daughter and White House adviser, is obviously not ""responsible for 14 million jobs this year."" The President was referring to the Pledge to America's Workers, an initiative for which companies had : Given that fewer than 6.5 million jobs had been created during the entire Trump presidency through September, Ivanka Trump, the President's daughter and White House adviser, is obviously not ""responsible for 14 million jobs this year."" The President was referring to the Pledge to America's Workers, an initiative for which companies had promised to create 14.3 million ""new opportunities"" for workers as of Tuesday -- but many of these ""opportunities"" are internal training opportunities, not new jobs.

The web page for the pledge program describes them as ""education and training opportunities."" Also, as CNN has previously reported , many of the companies had already planned these opportunities before Ivanka Trump launched the initiative.

Energy production

""We've ended the war on American energy. America is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world..."" -- October 17 speech at opening of Louis Vuitton workshop in Alvarado, Texas

Trump claimed to have ended ""the war on a thing called American energy,"" then boasted that the US is ""now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: The US has not just ""now"" become the world's top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump's policies: it took the top spot : The US has not just ""now"" become the world's top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump's policies: it took the top spot in 2012 , under the very president he has accused of perpetuating the ""war."" The US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump's tenure.

The judiciary

Obama and judicial vacancies

""So I got in and say, 'How many federal judges do I have?' 'Sir, you have 142 two federal judges.' 'No, you don't understand the question. That's impossible. That would mean that President Obama didn't appoint 142 judges.'...And then they say, 'Obama, wasn't he such a wonderful president?' How are you a wonderful president -- how are you a wonderful president when the most important thing you can do you handed over to the Republicans, 142?"" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: Trump exaggerated. There were 104 vacancies on January 1, 2017, just before Trump was inaugurated, according to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments.

The history of judicial vacancies

""You know, when I got into office, they say the most important thing a president can do, I actually think it's defense, but they say is the appointment of federal judges. So when I got in -- always when you get in, there are none. How many do you have? 'I have none, none.'"" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: It's not true that presidents are usually left no judicial vacancies at all. According to Wheeler, there were 53 vacancies on January 1, 2009, just before Obama took office; 80 vacancies on January 1, 2001, just before George W. Bush took office; 107 vacancies on January 1, 1993, just before Bill Clinton took office.

So Trump had the most judges to appoint since Clinton, but, clearly, other presidents also had appointing to do.

Wind energy

Trump told his usual semi-comedic story about how, if ""windmills"" are used for energy as he said Democrats want, people's televisions will go out if the wind is not presently blowing: ""Windmills, you know? 'Darling, I want to watch Trump speak tonight. We can't, darling, the wind isn't blowing.'"" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas"
754,Michael Patrick Leahy,"At issue in the case, SeilaLawLLCvConsumerFinancialProtectionBureau, is (1) whether the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act’s:
…vesting of substantial executive authority in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent agency led by a single director, violates t… [+6798 chars]",The Supreme Court announced on Friday that it will take up a case on the constitutionality of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).,2019-10-22,Breitbart News,SCOTUS to Rule on Constitutionality of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/21/scotus-to-rule-on-constitutionality-of-consumer-financial-protection-bureau/,"The Supreme Court announced on Friday that it will take up a case on the constitutionality of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

At issue in the case, Seila Law LLC v Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is (1) whether the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act’s:

…vesting of substantial executive authority in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent agency led by a single director, violates the separation of powers; and (2) whether, if the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is found unconstitutional on the basis of the separation of powers, [the portion of the Dodd-Frank Act that established the agency] can be severed from the [rest of that statute].

The powers and independence given to the director of the CFPB under the Dodd-Frank Act are extraordinary. Once appointed by the president to a five year term and confirmed by the Senate, the director cannot be fired by the president unless it is “for cause,” meaning that the director could not be removed for pursuing policies counter to the president’s agenda.

A ruling is expected by June of 2020, which could place the issue at the center of the presidential election. The agency was the brainchild of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who is currently either leading or tied with former Vice President Joe Biden in most national polls for the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination.

Amy Howe wrote on Friday at SCOTUSblog:

The dispute is not merely an academic one: If the justices agree that the restrictions violate the doctrine known as the separation of powers – the idea that the Constitution divides the different functions of government among the executive, judicial and legislative branches – their ruling could potentially unravel all the CFPB’s decisions in the nine years since its creation. The case now before the court was filed by Seila Law, a law firm that provides, according to its briefs, “a variety of legal services to consumers, including assistance with the resolution of consumer debt.” When the CFPB began an investigation into whether Seila had violated federal telemarketing laws, it sought information and documents from the firm. Seila objected to the request. It argued that the structure of the CFPB is unconstitutional because the bureau is headed by a single director, who has significant power but can only be removed by the president “for cause” – that is, for a very good reason. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit conceded that Seila’s argument was “not without force,” but it ultimately concluded that the Supreme Court’s cases point in the other direction. Although the director can only be removed for cause, the court of appeals reasoned, that restriction does not “impede the President’s ability to perform his constitutional duty to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed.”

The current director of the CFPB, Kathy Kraninger, has publicly stated that she believes it is unconstitutional that the president does not have the authority under the law to fire her or any future director without a specific cause.

Sen. Warren, for her part, vigorously argues that both the agency and the status of the director are constitutional. Should the Supreme Court rule against either of those components of the law, Warren is sure to make the ruling a big 2020 campaign issue.

Leftists have criticized the conduct of the CFPB since Richard Cordray, an Obama appointee, stepped down in November 2017 to run for governor of Ohio as the Democrat nominee, a race he lost in November 2018 to Republican Gov. Mike DeWine.

Cordray was replaced by current White House Chief of Staff and former OMB director Mick Mulvaney as acting director. Subsequently, President Trump nominated Mulvaney’s deputy director at OMB, Kathy Kraninger, to serve as director. Kraninger was confirmed by the Senate in December 2018.

Under Mulvaney and Kraninger, the controversial and overreaching enforcement actions undertaken by the CFPB under Cordray’s leadership have declined dramatically.

This is not the first challenge to the constitutionality of the CFPB that has come to the Supreme Court for consideration.

In January, the Supreme Court decided not to hear an appeal of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decision in the case of State National Bank of Big Spring v. Mnuchin

The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), one of the plaintiffs in the case, noted on its website that “[t]he lawsuit argued that the structure of the CFPB violates the Constitution’s separation of powers because the agency is insulated against meaningful checks by the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government.”

For example, unlike other agency heads, the CFPB’s director can only be fired by the president for specified causes. Normally, agency heads serve at the will of the president, an arrangement that makes an appointee more responsive and accountable to the president and, by extension, the American people. Also, unlike other regulatory agencies, Congress has no power to approve or disapprove the CFPB’s budget. Instead, the CFPB budget is taken from the budget of the Federal Reserve, which is the central banking system of the United States. That funding arrangement means the CFPB is not subject to Congress’s “power of the purse,” and it severely worsens the agency’s unaccountability. In effect, the CFPB functions like a fourth branch of government, unauthorized by the Constitution.

The lawsuit was filed in 2012, dismissed by a federal district judge in 2013, then appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and remanded back to the district court where, the CEI website added, “our case was put on hold by the district court pending the D.C. Circuit’s consideration of another court case, PHH Corp. v CFPB.”

In October 2016, a three-judge panel found the CFPB’s structure to be unconstitutional because its director could not be removed at will by the president. But on January 31, 2018, the en banc circuit court overturned the panel’s 2016 decision, effectively giving future heads of agencies like the CFPB enormous power with scant accountability. In the wake of this ruling, the district court in our case granted a joint motion for judgment against us in February, 2018. That ruling was summarily affirmed by the D.C. Circuit on June 8, 2018. We filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court on September 6, 2018, but our petition was subsequently denied on January 14, 2019.

“As a party in the first major challenge to the constitutionality of this agency, we are glad to see that this issue has now been taken up by the Supreme Court,” Sam Kazman, general counsel of the CEI said on Friday.

“We urge the Supreme Court to rule that the CFPB as structured is unconstitutional in order to help ensure government agencies are accountable to American consumers and voters,” CEI Senior Fellow John Berlau added.

“Under the leadership of current Director Kathleen Kraninger, the CFPB has made some positive, free-market reforms that greatly benefit consumers. But her good leadership doesn’t change our belief that the CFPB must be made constitutionally accountable by having a director subject to at-will removal by the person that Americans elect as their president,” Berlau concluded."

White House spokesman Hogan Gidley spoke to reporters and noted that the current impeachment process lacks “due process.”

He added, “The president’s not comparing what’s happened to him to one of the country’s darkest moments.”

The president’s description of the partisan impeachment effort as a political “lynching” drew ire from Democrats across the board, including a handful of 2020 candidates.

“Lynching is a reprehensible stain on this nation’s history, as is this President,” Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) wrote. “We’ll never erase the pain and trauma of lynching, and to invoke that torture to whitewash your own corruption is disgraceful”:

However, Democrats seemed to forget that their own House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) used similar terminology to describe the impeachment effort against former President Bill Clinton in 1998. At the time, he accused the GOP of “running a lynch mob.”

“I am the president’s defender in the sense that I haven’t seen anything yet that would rise, in my opinion, to the level of impeachable offense,” Nadler said at the time. “I wish we could get this over with quickly.”

“In pushing the process, in pushing the arguments of fairness and due process the Republicans so far have been running a lynch mob,” he added.

This is not the first time the terminology has been used to describe issues in the political realm. In 2015, CNN featured an op-ed titled, “Benghazi hearing: The high-tech lynching of Hillary Clinton.”

“And Then the Breitbart Lynch Mob Came for Me,” a 2017 piece from Foreign Policy reads.

In 2016, the Washington Post featured an op-ed titled, “Comey caves to a lynch-mob mentality,” which claimed that Republicans had become a “lynch mob.”

“Republicans had become a lynch mob, demanding frontier justice, and they howled in outrage when Comey refused to participate in the hanging, accusing him of unfairly rigging the election when all he had done was his job,” the piece reads, later assessing that conservatives “have succumbed to the same lynch-mob mentality that Comey caved to that now threatens the integrity of our electoral process.”"

“@Beyonce speaks the truth,” Clinton wrote as her caption alongside the hashtag #GutsyWomen — an homage to her latest children’s book.

Clinton’s comment was met with a load of backlash from commenters.

“Or in your case, buy it,” one user wrote.

“This seems to be contradicting the principles of democracy!” another reminded the failed Trump challenger.

“And you have stolen yours,” another commented. “Corruption is your power.”

However, there were also many users who praised Clinton for essentially courting Beyoncé’s fan base, which refers to itself as the “Beyhive.”

“Take that White House, Hillary!!” one wrote, with another adding, “I hope Beyoncé is the first woman president.”

The post also fueled speculation surrounding the possibility of a 2020 run, which Clinton has teased in recent weeks. Earlier this month, President Trump tweeted that “Crooked Hillary” should join the race “to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren” as long as she explains “all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting ‘C’ Subpoena!”

Clinton replied, “Don’t tempt me. Do your job.”

Don’t tempt me. Do your job. — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 8, 2019

Her recent remarks on PBS NewsHour furthered speculation. Clinton told the outlet that she could “obviously” beat Trump “again.”

“Maybe there does need to be a rematch. I mean, obviously, I can beat him again,” she said. “But, just seriously, I don’t understand. I don’t think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.”

Political commentator and former Bill Clinton adviser Dick Morris said this week that there is a chance the former secretary of state will launch another presidential bid.

“I think it’s always possible that Hillary runs,” Morris said during an appearance on The Cats Roundtable on Sunday. “You know, John, there’s a test you can do at home. Just put your fingers on her wrist, and if you feel a pulse, you know she’s going to run.”

This is far from the first time Clinton has tried to use the Grammy-winning singer to boost her political and cultural status. Clinton made an appearance at Jay-Z’s “get-out-the-vote rally” in Cleveland, Ohio, in 2016, where Beyoncé delivered a passionate speech in support of the then-Democrat nominee.

“We have to vote. The world looks to us as a progressive country that leads change. Eight years ago, I was so inspired that my nephew, a young black child, could grow up knowing his dreams could be realized by witnessing a black president in office,” Beyoncé said. “And now, we have the opportunity to create more change. I want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country and know that her possibilities are limitless.”

Ilhan Omar (D-MN) dismissed concerns of the overall cost of implementing a government-run healthcare system in the United States, stating that ""we can afford Medicare for All.""",2019-10-22,Breitbart News,Ilhan Omar Claims the U.S. ‘Can Afford Medicare for All’,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/22/ilhan-omar-claims-the-u-s-can-afford-medicare-for-all/,"Omar responded to a New York Times op-ed, which essentially argues the U.S. should cut military spending and instead use the money to pay for the costly Medicare for All system.

According to the op-ed:

Over 18 years, the United States has spent $4.9 trillion on wars, with only more intractable violence in the Middle East and beyond to show for it. That’s nearly the $300 billion per year over the current system that is estimated to cover Medicare for All (though estimates vary). While we can’t un-spend that $4.9 trillion, imagine if we could make different choices for the next 20 years. We’ve identified more than $300 billion in annual military savings alone that we could better invest in priorities like Medicare for All, working with a national grassroots movement called Poor People’s Campaign.

“We can afford Medicare for All,” Omar wrote. “What we cannot afford is losing more lives to endless wars and a health insurance industry that profits off sickness”:

We can afford Medicare for All. What we cannot afford is losing more lives to endless wars and a health insurance industry that profits off sickness. https://t.co/STeTKxFFt0 — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) October 22, 2019

While estimates tend to vary, one from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University assessed that the government-run healthcare system would cost $32 trillion over the next decade alone and would require massive tax increases. It would ultimately result in a “transformative change in the size of the federal government,” according to the study’s author Charles Blahous.

As Breitbart News reported:

Blahous argues that the estimates for the $32 trillion price tag are relatively conservative because they assume that Sanders’ bill achieves its goals of reducing payments to health providers, as well as lowering drug prices and administrative costs. The Mercatus Center suggested that doubling federal individual and corporate income tax would not cover the costs of the “Medicare for all” plan.

However, Blahous later testified before the House Rules Committee’s hearing on Medicare for All and said the federal government’s total spending on a government-run healthcare system could top $60 trillion over the next decade.

As Breitbart News reported:

Blahous said that the $32 trillion price tag was too conservative and that given historical spending levels on health care, net new federal spending would likely increase spending by $38.8 trillion over the next ten years and would increase federal healthcare spending to 13 to 15 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The Mercatus scholar also noted that the Medicare for All’s total federal spending price over the next ten years would amount to between $54.6 trillion and $60.7 trillion. Blahous mentioned that “doubling individual and corporate income taxes would be insufficient to finance even the lower bound” of the $32.6 trillion in new federal spending.

Most Americans, 64 percent, are opposed to paying more in taxes to implement Medicare for All, according to a Locust Street Group released in August.

Omar’s position follows her endorsement of socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who remains a fierce proponent of a single-payer system. Sanders has been extremely forthcoming on how he would pay for the implementation of the multi-trillion dollar proposal, openly admitting that taxes will go up for middle class Americans but arguing that overall “cost” will go down as premiums are erased. The latter is an argument Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has made repeatedly, but she has yet to explicitly say if she would raise taxes on middle class Americans to pay for Medicare for All.

“What our bill does … what people should understand is that what Medicare for All does is eliminates your private health insurance premiums. You’re not going to be paying that, you’re not going to be paying co-payments, you’re not going to be paying deductibles,’ Sanders told Iowa CBS affiliate KCCI in May.

“You’re going to be seeing your prescription drug cost, in my view, come down by 50 percent. Will you be paying more in taxes? Yes, you will,” he added.

Cost, however, is not the only concern. Opponents of Medicare for All also point to bureaucratic mismanagement and argue that a government-run healthcare system will result in a sharp decline in overall quality of care."

That might be a costly error. | Economy,2019-10-23,Breitbart News,Carney: Why Fannie and Freddie Shareholders May Get Wiped Out in a Recap,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2019/10/23/carney-why-fannie-and-freddie-shareholders-may-get-wiped-out-in-a-recap/,"Shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac crashed on Wednesday after their regulator said the Trump administration stood willing to wipe out shareholders if needed to put the company back into private hands.

“If the circumstances present itself to where we have to wipe out the shareholders, we will,” Federal Housing Finance Agency director Mark Calabria said during a hearing before the House Financial Service Committee Tuesday.

Shares fell immediately following the comments. On Wednesday, Fannie shares fell by 9.2 percent and Freddie shares fell by 9.3 percent. Compared with its recent high in September, Fannie shares are down 27 percent.

Calabria’s comments caught many shareholders off-guard because he has long been looked at as an ally, chiefly because he has said he wants to return the companies to private control and co-authored a white paper arguing that their long stay in conservatorship is not in keeping with the 2008 law that empowered the FHFA to take them over.

The Trump administration has broken with the Obama administration’s policy, and the proposals of many lawmakers over several years, that assumed the companies would eventually be wound down, phased out, replaced by new market mechanics or private-public partnerships, or broken up. Even before President Donald Trump took office, then-Treasury Secretary-to-be Steven Mnuchin said that privatizing Fannie and Freddie was a top administration priority.

That was a welcome change to shareholders, many of whom had purchased shares of the companies in the belief that eventually they would return to private control. Many investors, including some famous fund managers, have battled the government for years seeking to pry their profits from the hands of the U.S. Treasury. These efforts have largely met with failure in federal courts, although a federal appeals court based in New Orleans recently dealt them a significant victory.

Calabria expressing a willingness to “wipe out” existing shareholders has shaken the newfound confidence that had seen shares quadruple in value this year.

That confidence looks misplaced. The FHFA said last year the two companies would need to around $180 billion of combined capital to be considered well-capitalized, although the agency has yet to finalize the capital requirements. Currently, Fannie has $6.4 billion in capital and Freddie has $4.8 billion. That leaves a $167 billion capital gap, nearly seven times their combined income last year.

The Trump administration has said it is exploring the possibility of closing that capital gap by going to public securities markets. But it is unclear how much capital could be raised. The largest initial public offering this year raised $8.1 billion for Uber. The largest IPO in history, Alibaba’s 2014 offering, raised around $25 billion.

Fannie and Freddie have incredibly complex equity structures. Fannie has common shares worth a total of $3.4 billion. The government has a contractual right to exercise warrants to 79.9 percent of the common equity, which at current the current valuation would be equal to around $13.6 billion. Each company has tens of billions of dollars of junior preferred which trade well-below face value now because the company has paid out dividends on them for over a decade and is barred from doing so without the consent of the Treasury Department.

In addition, the U.S. Treasury holds senior preferred shares that currently require the companies to pay nearly all of their positive net worth above an agreed upon amount of retained capital to the government’s coffers. In exchange for this so-called “net worth sweep,” the government gave up on an earlier right to a 10 percent annual dividend that was due even if the companies did not earn enough to pay it. A few years ago, the net worth sweep meant the government received far more than it would have under the 10 percent deal. Now it typically means the government receives billions of dollars less.

Then there is the government’s ongoing promise to supply them with new capital if they run into financial trouble–a promise that everyone agrees is absolutely vital to their ongoing ability to sell guaranteed mortgage bonds. The companies have never paid the commitment fee on this facility called for by their bailout agreement.

Finally, there is the special relationship the companies have with the Federal Reserve. The Fed has acquired hundreds of billions of dollars of their bonds since the financial crisis, making the central bank the biggest holder of their securities. This makes them unique and distinctly unprivate. Apart from Treasury bonds and the bonds of Ginnie Mae, a purely government entity, only Fannie and Freddie have the Fed as a customer for their product. In many years, the Fed has bought more Fannie and Freddie bonds than they have issued, highlighting just how significant these operations are for the companies.

Any transaction to take the companies private would require dealing with each of these pieces.

Any new equity issuance would exist the outstanding common shares, perhaps even the government’s yet unborn 80 percent stake. Raising enough capital to recapitalize the companies might be difficult if the new equity is on par with the current equity. New investors may press for the new shares to be subordinated or crammed down.

The Fed purchases would likely have to be phased out, which would test whether the market has enough appetite to absorb all of their issuances. It might also put unwelcome pressure on Treasury yields as the Fed would likely be forced to replace Fannie and Freddie paper with government bonds as the mortgage-backed securities rolled off its balance sheet.

Fannie and Freddie would have to begin paying for the ongoing backstop from Treasury, leaving less capital to meet FHFA requirements and ultimately less profit to entice new shareholders.

Most importantly, the senior preferred shares would need to be extinguished or severely modified. Obviously, so long as the government is entitled to all the profits, investors will stay away. Some have argued that the government could simply cancel the senior preferred shares, perhaps by deeming them repaid in full. Although the companies have now paid more in dividends than they received in the bailout, that could cause a political firestorm because the government would be essentially giving away an asset worth close to $315 billion for nothing.

While it is true that the government would then be able to exercise its warrants, these only give it 80 percent of the common and would subordinate the government’s interest to the junior preferred. In other words, the government would still be giving up tens of billions of dollars of value in exchange for nothing.

Making the politics even more difficult, this giveaway would result in a huge windfall for the current shareholders. The largest holders of both the common and the junior preferred are hedge funds run by billionaires. It seems unlikely that the Trump administration would want to walk through this political minefield while taking fire from populist rivals like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.

The $315 billion figure for the value of the senior preferred shares comes from very simple equity arithmetic. It is a little more than 13 times last year’s earnings, a bit higher than the price-to-earnings ratio of J.P. Morgan Chase.

But that $315 billion political landmine could also become a bridge to taking the companies private. Instead of simply canceling the senior preferred shares, the government could slowly auction them off. This would provide the government a solid return on its assets, allow for capital to be raised over time rather than in a one-shot IPO, and allow for the price to adjust as market conditions change. It would also give the mortgage market time to adjust to the slow-motion privatization of the companies.

New investors would be asked to step into the place of the U.S. government as the holders of shares that are entitled to all of the profits of the companies, something that would likely make them very attractive to investors. The sales of senior preferred would not themselves recapitalize the companies but they would transfer control and ownership while retained earnings built up the required capital buffer.

This would wipe out the existing common shares and perhaps the existing junior preferred shares. Their current total subordination would become permanent and lasting. No doubt some shareholders would challenge the move in court but after a long string of legal victories defending the net worth sweep, the threat of further litigation is unlikely to deter the government.

Shareholders assumed that Calabria’s drive to privatize Fannie and Freddie meant he was on their side. This may prove to be a costly error."

Biden has the support of 34% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters, his best showing in CNN polling since just after his campaign's formal launch on April 25.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont are about even for second, with 19% and 16%, respectively. Behind them, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris of California each have 6% support, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke each at 3%.

Biden's rise comes largely from a consolidation of support among his core backers, and doesn't appear to harm any individual opponent. Warren and Sanders hold about even with their standing in the last CNN poll in September, and no other candidate has seen a shift of more than 2 points in that time.

But Biden has seen big spikes in support among moderate and conservative Democrats (43% support him now, up from 29% in the September poll), racial and ethnic minorities (from 28% among all nonwhites in September to 42% now) and older voters (up 13 points since September among those 45 and older) that outpace those among younger potential Democratic voters (up 5 points among those younger than 45).

The gains come as Biden's time as vice president is put under the spotlight by President Donald Trump and his allies. Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry by the House of Representatives over allegations that he pressured the Ukrainian government to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, as well as the 2016 US election in return for releasing hundreds of millions in congressionally mandated defense funding meant for Ukraine. Hunter Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while Biden was vice president. There is no evidence that either Biden did anything wrong in Ukraine.

The poll suggests that although Biden's October debate performance did not blow away the audience (15% who watched or followed news about it said he had done the best job in the debate, well behind Warren's 28% -- but better than most on the stage), the arguments he made on health care, foreign policy and the economy may have boosted his standing with the potential Democratic electorate.

Asked which candidate would best handle a range of top issues, Biden leads the way on four of the six issues tested in the poll. He holds a massive edge over the field on foreign policy (56% say he would handle it best, well ahead of Sanders at 13% and Warren at 11%), and tops the next closest candidate by nearly 20 points on the economy (38% Biden, 19% Sanders, 16% Warren). Biden also outpaces the rest of the field as most trusted on immigration (29% Biden, 16% each Warren and Sanders) and gun policy (27% vs. 13% Sanders and 11% Warren, with O'Rourke close at 9%).

Biden doesn't hold a significant edge on the critical issue of health care (31% Biden, 28% Sanders, 17% Warren) but he's surged 13 points on the issue since June, when he lagged behind Sanders. Neither Sanders' nor Warren's numbers on the issue have moved significantly in that time.

And Biden now runs even with Sanders at 26% as best able to handle the climate crisis. Warren is at 18% on that issue. The results mark increases for Biden and Sanders, who were each at 19% on handling the climate in June.

The former vice president's advantages on the issues come as he emphasizes an approach that appears to align with the preferences of most potential Democratic voters. A 53% majority say they want the nominee to advocate policies that have a good chance of becoming law, even if the changes aren't as big, vs. 42% who prefer advocating big changes even if they have less of a chance of becoming law.

Among those voters who prefer an approach that prioritizes policies with a better chance of becoming law, 38% support Biden for the Democratic nomination, 17% Warren and just 8% Sanders. On the other side, it's nearly a three-way split, with 27% behind Biden, 24% Sanders and 21% Warren.

About 1 in 5 potential Democratic voters say they watched last week's debate among 12 Democratic candidates, and those who watched it came away with a different assessment than those who mainly followed news about the debate. Overall, among everyone who either watched or followed news coverage on the debate, 28% say Warren had the best night, 15% Biden, 13% Sanders, 11% Buttigieg, 4% Klobuchar and 2% Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, with the rest at 1% or less. Among those who say they watched it, though, Warren remains on top at 29%, but 21% say Buttigieg had the best night, then 13% Biden, 11% Sanders, 10% Klobuchar and 4% Booker, with everyone else at 1% or less.

And those who watched the debate seem to have more favorable views of the lesser-known candidates who were seen as having good nights than do those who followed coverage. Among debate watchers, 74% have a favorable view of Buttigieg, vs. 54% among those who followed news instead. Booker's favorability rating is 80% among those who watched, vs. 55% among those who followed coverage, and Klobuchar's favorability stands at 56% among watchers vs. 36% among those who followed news.

Warren tops the list of candidates who potential Democratic voters say they want to hear more about: 31% name her, 24% Buttigieg, 23% Harris, 18% Booker, 17% Sanders, 16% Biden, 13% Klobuchar, 11% O'Rourke and 10% businessman Andrew Yang.

Majorities of potential Democratic voters say they would at least be satisfied with any of the top three becoming the party's nominee, with about 4 in 10 saying they'd be enthusiastic about Biden (43%), Warren (41%) or Sanders (39%). Fewer would feel as excited should Buttigieg become the party's nominee (27% enthusiastic).

Registered voters generally give Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg large advantages over President Donald Trump in hypothetical general election matchups. Biden leads the President by 10 points, 53% to 43%, with Sanders up 9 (52% to 43%) and Warren up 8 (52% to 44%). Buttigieg holds a 6-point edge, 50% to 44%.

The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS from October 17 through 20 among a random national sample of 1,003 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer, including 424 registered voters who are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. For results among potential Democratic voters, it is plus or minus 5.8 points."
762,"Nima Elbagir, Florence Davey-Attlee and Jack Guy, CNN",,US Sen. Elizabeth Warren has written to US government agencies demanding answers after a CNN investigation revealed that American-made weapons in Yemen are being turned on the internationally recognized and US-backed government.,2019-10-23,CNN,Elizabeth Warren demands answers from US government after CNN's Yemen investigation,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/23/politics/elizabeth-warren-letter-yemen-cnn-investigation-intl/index.html,"(CNN) US Sen. Elizabeth Warren has written to US government agencies demanding answers after a CNN investigation revealed that American-made weapons in Yemen are being turned on the internationally recognized and US-backed government.

Last week, CNN revealed that military hardware supplied to US allies had been distributed in contravention of arms deals to militia groups, including separatists backed by the United Arab Emirates. The separatists are now using that hardware to fight the Saudi Arabia-supported forces of the internationally recognized government, who are also armed with US weapons.

""These unauthorized diversions of American military hardware to armed groups ... undermine US national security objectives in securing a political settlement to the conflict in Yemen, which has no military solution and remains one of the world's worst humanitarian crises,"" reads Warren's letter, which was sent Monday and is addressed to US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

This is the second time that Warren, a candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, has written to the US agencies about arms transfers in Yemen following CNN reporting.

In February, a CNN investigation revealed that Saudi Arabia and the UAE had transferred American-made weapons to al Qaeda-linked fighters, hardline Salafi militias, and other factions waging war in Yemen, in violation of their agreements with the United States.

The weapons also made their way into the hands of Iranian-backed rebels battling the coalition for control of the country, exposing some of America's sensitive military technology to Tehran and potentially endangering the lives of US troops in other conflict zones.

Responding to the latest evidence published by CNN last week, a UAE official said: ""There were no instances when US-made equipment was used without direct UAE oversight. Except for four vehicles that were captured by the enemy."" The Saudi government has not responded to CNN's requests for comment on this issue.

Warren sent the agencies detailed questions about the supervision of US-made weapons but received no reply other than a ""brief acknowledgment from the State Department,"" according to her letter.

""The latest report underscores the need for concrete answers to my initial inquiry, highlights the importance of preventing unauthorized access, unauthorized transfers, or other violations of end-user agreements by foreign governments, and raises legitimate questions about whether it is in America's interest to continue selling arms and other military hardware to the Saudi and UAE governments,"" wrote Warren.

CNN has reached out to the State Department and Pentagon for comment on Warren's letter.

Following CNN's initial reporting in February, the Pentagon said it had launched its own investigation into the unauthorized transfer of US weapons in Yemen. In response to CNN's new findings, Pentagon spokesperson Lt. Col. Carla Gleason said in September that the joint investigation by the State Department and Department of Defense remains ""ongoing.""

But more than half a year since the investigation was launched, the situation on the ground appears to have gotten worse.

Saudi Arabia has led a coalition, in close partnership with the UAE and including various militia groups, to fight the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen since 2015. But, in a clear break with its Saudi partners, the UAE said in July that it was reducing its forces in the country, and fighting escalated between separatists and government forces on the ground in August. The UAE has since thrown its support behind the separatist movement.

In recent months there have been multiple efforts by US lawmakers to force President Donald Trump to end US financial and military backing for the war in Yemen.

Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat, authored an amendment to the annual US defense spending bill, which is currently being debated in Washington, that would cut off support for the Saudi-led coalition until the Secretary of Defense can certify that both the Saudis and Emiratis have stopped transferring US weapons to third parties in Yemen.

In June 2019 the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) reported that the total number of reported fatalities in Yemen is more than 91,000 since 2015."

The formerCEO told CNN's Poppy Harlow in an exclusive interview on Thursday that Warren ""probably thinks more of cataclysmic change to the economic system as opposed to tinkering.""

That's riskier, Blankfein said, because America's economic system is the ""envy of the world.""

Blankfein, speaking at the CITIZEN by CNN conference in New York City, also pushed back against the recent argument byCEO Marc Benioff that capitalism as we know it is over

""Capitalism is not dead,"" said Blankfein, who stepped down as Goldman Sachs' CEO last fall. But he acknowledged that the system ""has to adapt,"" with an aim of making it fairer and preventing monopolies.

Paying more in taxes

Blankfein said that some of Bernie Sanders' ideas are good ones and he is open to the idea of wealth ""redistribution"" by changing the nation's tax structure.

""We have to listen to what people are saying and respond to it,"" he said. ""You know, you're not guaranteed stability in the world. Look at what's going on in Hong Kong.""

I sure as heck would be willing to pay more tax if it could buy a happier and less polarized society."" former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein

For instance, Blankfein thinks the rich could pay more in taxes.

""I'd like to pay no taxes, but I'd like to live in a civilized world where people aren't coming with torches and rakes trying to, you know, kill each other,"" said Blankfein. ""I sure as heck would be willing to pay more tax if it could buy a happier and less polarized society.""

Both Warren and Sanders have endorsed a tax on wealth. Warren has called for taxing fortunes of more than $50 million at 2% each year and wealth of more than $1 billion at 3%.

Blankfein said it's ""hard to imagine"" a wealth tax because it would be incredibly complicated to calculate. He noted that wealth taxes can take many years to sort out.

Even though Blankfein is a registered Democrat who supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, his career on Wall Street has made him unpopular with the liberal wing of the party. In July, Sanders put Blankfein on his list of ""anti-endorsements.""

Blankfein said that he's still a Democrat -- ""they haven't kicked me out yet"" -- but declined to name a 2020 candidate that he'd endorse.

""If I really wanted to hurt a Democratic candidate, I would give my full endorsement,"" he joked.

Tariffs are hurting. But are they necessary?

Blankfein also weighed in on the US-China trade war.

Although White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has downplayed the economic pain of the trade war, Blankfein conceded it's real.

""Of course, tariffs are hurting us,"" Blankfein said.

However, he suggested that the tariffs could be an effective tool for the United States to convince China to play fair on trade. He compared the tariffs to union workers who decide to go on strike.

""Is the union being hurt by striking General Motors? Of course, it is,"" Blankfein said. ""But they're relying on the fact that maybe GM is being hurt more. How else do you get your adversary to the bargaining table?""

The trade war has exacerbated the global economic slowdown and increased the risk of a recession in the United States.

But Blankfein doesn't sound overly concerned that the economic expansion, already the longest in American history, will come to a sudden end.

Although he joked that he ""wrote the book on paranoia,"" he suggested the economy may keep humming along -- unless some sort of a shock emerges.

Not all shocks are bad, Blankfein said, noting that a positive shock, such as a resolution to the trade war, is possible.

""The base case is that the economy is motoring along fairly well, but nothing lasts forever,"" he said."

A report by the Wall Street Journal reveals that three illegal aliens working for Sanders’ 2020 Democrat presidential primary campaign helped craft the democratic-socialists’ plan to decriminalize illegal immigration, end deportations, and stop federal immigration raids.

All three illegal alien Sanders staffers have been allowed to stay in the U.S. through former President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

The Journal notes:

The campaign has a Latino outreach program that spans every early state, and has held specific events tailored to the Latino community in Iowa and California. (California holds its primary on March 3, a month after Iowa. But voters can begin mail-in voting the same day as Iowa.) Of the 542 paid staff on the campaign in the third quarter, at least 70 are Latino, according to the campaign. Three of the staff members who worked on Mr. Sanders’s immigration policy are beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. [Emphasis added]

Despite repeatedly denouncing open borders and its impact on the quality of life, wages, and economic opportunities of America’s working and middle class, Sanders’ 2020 immigration plan endorses policies that end federal immigration enforcement.

Like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sanders is promising to decriminalize illegal immigration to the U.S., making it only a civil violation to cross international borders. Similarly, Sanders has introduced a plan to at least temporarily end raids and deportations by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.

As Breitbart News reported in March, a Federal Election Commission (FEC) complaint was filed against Sanders’ campaign for his hiring of the three DACA illegal aliens. The complaint alleges that Sanders’ hiring of foreign nationals for advisory jobs on his campaign equates to foreign election interference.

(CNN) Will 2020 see the return of the brokered national political convention -- that is, a convention where delegates are unable to agree on a nominee during the first round of voting, making it necessary to ""broker"" delegates between candidates in subsequent rounds to arrive at a nominee?

It's hard to ignore the potential for a first-round deadlock at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) convention next July. While it's true that every four years political pundits warn of the potential for brokered convention, and it hasn't happened in over half a century, the combination of a historically large field of candidates, no clear front-runner , a heavily front-loaded primary schedule and a change in Democratic party rules means that 2020 could be the year the prediction finally comes true.

Let's start with the candidates. Despite several recent drop-outs, 19 Democrats remain in the hunt for the nomination. History tells us that more will quit the race before the Iowa caucuses on February 3, but it's easy to imagine eight or more of the current field, including Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Beto O'Rourke, Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard and, of course, the top tier of Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden staying in the race at least through the New Hampshire primary on February 11.

One of the reasons they are likely to stay in the race is that former Vice President Joe Biden, long the front-runner, now looks weaker than he did. For months now, Biden's national poll average has remained stuck at around 30%. Democratic primary math, by which only candidates receiving at least 15% of the vote are awarded delegates, means the percentage of delegates earned will exceed the percentage of primary votes for the top candidates. Still, it will be a stretch for Biden, or any other candidate, to go from just below 30% in the polls to the 51% of delegates required to secure the nomination.

Polling in the early caucus and primary states provides more evidence for this uncertainty. Recent numbers show a tie between Biden and Elizabeth Warren in the Iowa caucuses, Warren ahead of Biden in New Hampshire and a tie in Nevada -- but it's a tie between Biden and Sanders, not Biden and Warren.

CBS News and YouGov have teamed up to use polling to try to estimate delegate allocation through Super Tuesday on March 3. In September, they estimated that although Biden was ahead, he would fall nearly 150 delegates short of a majority. About a week ago, though, CBS and YouGov changed their forecast to show Warren in the lead, though still somewhat short of a majority.

This swing shows the volatility of the Democratic primary.

Now, as the political scientist Josh Putnam has rightly pointed out , the problem with trusting this approach to forecasting is that all of the primaries do not take place on one day and, as Putnam puts it, ""sequence matters."" The results in one state can influence the result in subsequent states. Speculation about brokered conventions usually dies down once a candidate begins winning primaries and building up momentum. In 2020, though, there will be little time for the natural winnowing of the field that has occurred in the past.

In the one-month period between the Iowa caucuses and Super Tuesday, about 40% of the total number of delegates voting in the first round of the Democratic National Convention will have been selected. In comparison, in 2016 only about a quarter of the delegates were distributed during that same period. A few weeks later, by the end of March, nearly 70% of the delegates will have been chosen.

We are nearly four months from the first primary, and support may coalesce around one or two candidates prior to the start of voting, but if even three potentially viable candidates are left at the end of March, with none having a majority of the delegates already selected, it now becomes very difficult for any one candidate to get to a majority. There simply aren't that many delegates left, and the Democratic party mandates proportional allocation of delegates. The state-level formula is often complex, but in most cases, any candidate receiving at least 15% of either the statewide vote and/or the congressional district vote will be awarded delegates.

Which brings us to the final element that makes a brokered convention more likely this year than in the past: the rules change that the Democratic party made to how voting will work at the 2020 convention

Since delegates are awarded on a proportional basis, it is often difficult for Democratic candidates to get to a majority. This is why both the 2008 and the 2016 Democratic primaries remained competitive late into the spring in both of those years. In fact, neither Barack Obama in 2008 nor Hillary Clinton in 2016 actually earned a majority of what are called pledged delegates during their respective primaries.

The 2008 and 2016 DNC conventions weren't ""brokered,"" though, because Democrats since 1984 have allowed a large number of unpledged or uncommitted delegates to attend and vote at the national convention. These so-called ""superdelegates"" -- and there were more than 700 of them in Philadelphia in 2016 -- are not bound by voting outcomes in any of the states. In fact, this large number of uncommitted superdelegates has made it difficult for Democratic candidates to obtain a majority of committed convention delegates without them.

The influence of the superdelegates over the years has led to cries of unfairness from candidates who were not awarded the nomination. Both Hillary Clinton in 2008 and Bernie Sanders in 2016 could correctly argue that, had the superdelegates offered them support, they could have been the party's nominee.

The presence of unelected superdelegates at a convention of the ""Democratic"" party has become something of an embarrassment: It just seems undemocratic. So, during the 2016 convention, the party decided to establish a "" Unity Reform Commission ,"" which, among other things, devised ways to reduce the role of superdelegates.

The result was a change in the convention rules so that, in 2020, superdelegates will not participate in the first round of voting under this scenario. So it is up to Democratic primary and caucus participants to avoid a brokered convention.

If, for all of the reasons that I've just presented, they fail to unify behind a single candidate, then we will have our first brokered convention in more than 60 years

While this would be exciting to watch, it could also be disastrous for the Democratic party. The superdelegates will enter in round two, and if, as is likely, they throw their weight behind one candidate, how will the other candidates' supporters react? Remember, there is some evidence that ""Bernie or Bust"" voters cost Hillary Clinton the White House in 2016.

(CNN) Reports of former Vice President Joe Biden's political demise have been greatly exaggerated. So says a new national poll taken by CNN . Instead of losing ground, Biden has again separated himself from the field with a substantial lead over his nearest rivals Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.

Polls are an imperfect snapshot of where the race is at any particular moment. They certainly don't predict at this point who will win the nomination and face President Donald Trump next fall. But there is a lot I believe we can learn from this poll.

The poll underlines the looming influence of President Trump on this race for the Democratic nomination. The news unfolding daily of President Trump's abuse of power on Capitol Hill underlines the focus Democrats have on removing Trump -- if not through impeachment , then at the ballot box.

The President's continuing to put his own interests before the country's makes electability the crucial issue for most Democrats. National polls as well as polls in battleground states show Biden as the strongest candidate against Trump, and as impeachment talk ramps up, Biden's status only improves.

As much as some Democratic voters may like the more radical policy proposals of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, Trump's increasingly erratic and corrupt behavior has helped Biden's message that beating Trump is the first and only thing that matters.

This new CNN poll also shows that the President's attacks on Biden and his family have boosted Biden's candidacy. Only weeks ago, it was unclear whether the baseless and false attacks were going to damage or boost Biden's fortunes among Democrats. The poll begins to answer that important question.

Many Democrats have come to Biden's defense and understand that Trump is attacking him in this way because he is the candidate the Republicans most fear. No one likes to be told who should run and who they should vote for. They particularly don't like to be told those things by the opposing party.

Some Democrats are also still extraordinarily bitter about how Hillary Clinton was subjected to misinformation and false and baseless charges in 2016. That sense of injustice among Democrats has proved to be critical insulation for Biden.

The second thing the poll tells us is you don't have to win the debates to win the nomination. While Biden has sometimes come up short on the style points on stage, he has given enough Democrats enough to work with to continue supporting him.

The debates over the last few months have been much more important to the second tier candidates, determining who can stay in the race and who needs to drop out. Neither Biden, Sanders nor Warren has significantly boosted nor hurt their chances for the nomination in the debates -- and that's likely to stay the same until the debates are winnowed down to just a handful of candidates.

We also see in this poll that moderate and conservative Democrats, who lack a prominent presence on Twitter and at the big campaign rallies, have stayed with Biden

Most Democrats around the country have not fully tuned into this race and even in Iowa, the site of the first in the nation caucus, nearly 75% of respondents to the most recent statewide poll , showing the race a dead heat, said they had not watched the CNN-NY Times debate in Columbus Ohio . If they're not watching yet in Iowa, you can bet there are large portions of Democrats waiting until next year to fully tune in to the race.

Finally, I think this poll dispels the idea from some observers that Democrats are looking for more candidates to enter the field. Biden's strength in this poll and in the various head to head polls with Trump in battleground states should put to rest the story of discontent with our candidates that repeats in almost every election cycle for the Democrats.

So, here's what the poll doesn't tell us: who's going to win the nomination. I have no doubt the poll accurately reflects Biden's strength nationally, as well as the strength of both Sanders and Warren. But national numbers have often proved less than predictive in the Democratic nomination process.

The race is a dynamic one -- what happens in Iowa will impact New Hampshire and what happens in New Hampshire impacts what happens in Nevada and so on.

The new numbers are not insignificant however. After Nevada and South Carolina we quickly move into large, multistate Tuesday primaries where national standing has much more impact.

The race remains wide open for those in the top tier and even a few in the second tier. But it reminds us to take with a grain of salt any predictions about the demise or the rise of any particular candidate and to wait until the voters have their say to decide this contest."

""In this time of crisis in our politics, it is not surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law to bring an end to his disastrous presidency,"" Kate Bedingfield, Biden's deputy campaign manager, said in a statement. ""Nothing changes unless we defeat Donald Trump.""

The statement, which is a stark shift in the position of the Biden campaign, came after CNN reported a coalition of top Democratic strategists and donors loyal to Biden were moving closer to setting up a super PAC to help the former vice president's candidacy.

The idea of building an outside organization had been the subject of discussion for weeks by Biden allies, but the conversations intensified in the wake of a cash crunch for the former vice president's campaign. Biden reported last week having less than $9 million in the bank, significantly less than his leading rivals.

Larry Rasky, the former Biden aide who is spearheading the effort to stand up the super PAC, responded to the Biden campaign by pledging to ""have (Biden's) back.""

""We intend to fight back against the lies and distortions we're seeing now from Trump, his allies, the Russians, and the Republican Party. While other candidates have groups supporting their efforts, no other Democrat has to fight this two-front war,"" Rasky said.

While Biden had previously spoken out against the creation of a super PAC, which would operate entirely separately from his campaign, several longtime allies say it's clear that his presidential bid needs help. No final decision has been made about launching the outside group, but allies have started contacting potential vendors and lining up possible donors to fuel a super PAC, sources familiar with the efforts tell CNN.

""They know they can use all the help they can get,"" one Biden ally told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the group. ""Trump is crushing him with spending.""

In the statement on Thursday, Bedingfield said Biden would ""push to remove private money from our federal elections"" if he won the White House.

But it was also clear Biden has no intention of unilaterally disarming in the wake of the attacks from Trump, with Bedingfield saying: ""He and his allies are already spending massive amounts of money on paid television and digital advertising to intervene directly in the Democratic primaries with the goal of preventing Joe Biden, the opponent that Trump fears most, from becoming the Democratic nominee.""

The Biden campaign's apparent reversal drew immediate criticism Thursday from one of his rivals, Bernie Sanders. In a statement, Sanders' campaign manager Faiz Shakir said Biden was ""endorsing an effort to buy the primary through a super PAC that can rake in unlimited cash from billionaires and corporations.""

Shakir called it ""a recipe to maintain a corrupt political system.""

The group End Citizens United, which opposes unlimited money in politics, also blasted the former vice president.

""It is incredibly disappointing to see Vice President Biden completely reverse his position now that times are tough,"" group president Tiffany Miller said in a statement. ""This is exactly the time he needs support from real people the most. We urge him to reconsider this decision and disavow this super PAC.""

The potential outside group would be comprised of longtime Biden supporters and admirers from the Obama-Biden administration who believe the former vice president has the best chance of defeating Trump. But they worry he is unable to compete in the Democratic primary while simultaneously fighting back against Trump.

Biden's fundraising haul last quarter totaled nearly $15.7 million, but the candidate spent more than he raised, ending the quarter with $8.98 million cash on hand. Biden is outmatched in cash reserves by South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has amassed a stockpile of $33.7 million.

Biden's allies are most concerned about combating the attacks coming from Trump. His reelection campaign, joint fundraising committees and the Republican National Committee ended the quarter with a combined $158 million cash on hand. Trump's massive war chest has already been used to target Biden and Democrats with millions of dollars in campaign ads in the wake of the Ukraine controversy, which prompted an impeachment inquiry into the President.

The former vice president recently told reporters he's ""confident"" his campaign will have the resources to engage in a potentially long primary fight despite the fundraising lag.

""Remember we got started later than anybody at all in this campaign, number one. Number two, we did not start off by dropping $10 million from a Senate campaign, wherever that money was raised from into a race,"" Biden said in Columbus following the debate last week. ""We're doing fine, our fundraising is building. We've raised a lot of money online, and we've raised money offline as well, so we feel confident we're going to be ready.""

A Biden adviser says the campaign has raised as much money online during the first two weeks of October as it did during the entire month of September.

Yet there is deep concern inside the Biden campaign and among his supporters.

Campaign filings show that one-quarter of Biden's spending in the July to September period went to payroll, and his campaign spent more than $920,000 on private charter flights in that same timeframe. Additionally, the Biden campaign spent $2 million on digital advertising and media ad buys last quarter, and earlier this month, it announced a $6 million digital and broadcast ad campaign in the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.

""We're comfortable with where we are, and we're comfortable with the investments we've made to date,"" said Pete Kavanaugh, deputy campaign manager for Biden. ""We feel we have more than enough resources to execute as we want to over the next 90 days as we head into Iowa.""

""There's not going to be any changes in the plans because this is where we planned to be,"" added Kavanaugh.

Biden has dedicated a significant portion of his time to traditional high dollar fundraisers, attending more than 70 donor events since he launched his campaign. But he's lagged in small-dollar donations, which have powered the fundraising apparatus of Sanders and Warren, who both have eschewed big-dollar fundraising in their campaigns.

The former vice president has relied on maxed-out contributors for 38% of the money he's raised so far in his presidential bid, according to an analysis of financial disclosure reports, giving the candidate fewer opportunities than many of his rivals to return to loyal donors again for cash as the Democratic primary campaign heats up.

More than $14 million of the $37.6 million Biden collected from individual contributors through the end of September came from donors who gave $2,800 or more to his bid for his party's presidential nomination, according to a tally provided to CNN by the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute, which examines money in politics.

By comparison, just 3% and 5% of the money raised by his Sanders and Warren, respectively, came from donors who donated at least $2,800 -- the maximum an individual can donate to a candidate for a primary election.

By contrast, Warren and Sanders have fueled their campaigns largely with online small-dollar contributors, who can be tapped repeatedly for money before hitting the $2,800 limit on primary donations. Nearly 70% of the individual contributions that Sanders has raised so far came from donors giving $200 or less; Warren has a similar profile, at about 64%.

Biden's share of individual contributions raised from small dollar donors during the course of the campaign stands at roughly 35%.

Joe Trippi, a veteran Democratic strategist, said Biden has enough money, right now.

""He can get through the early states without much of a problem, but if he stumbles during that period, his money could easily dry up,"" Trippi said. ""He's working without a net at that point. It's hard to see how small-dollar Internet money would flow for him at that moment, and the maxed-out donors can't do more.""

In recent days, the Biden campaign has intensified its pleas for money, pointing out in urgent fundraising requests the significant gap in campaign cash with some of his leading rivals.

""Right now, we're trailing Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders' cash-on-hand by big margins,"" Biden wrote in a fundraising e-mail Tuesday morning. ""We've got to make up lost ground quickly.""

A source close to the campaign acknowledged they intend to try dramatically ramping up their digital focus aiming to increase contributions and support, but it's not clear what immediate adjustments might be made to their fundraising operation.

""What you've got here is clearly the frontrunner for the entire time and a finance team that can't capitalize on that,"" said John Morgan, a Florida attorney who held a fundraiser for Biden earlier this year. ""Changes have to be made, and you know, Joe Biden is probably the nicest guy in the world, and it may be hard for him to do that, but too much is at stake not to do it.""

Since the start of his presidential bid, Biden's campaign has said he would disavow any spending from a super PAC.

But as he faces an onslaught of attacks from Trump and sluggish fundraising numbers, several allies say it's time for him to accept the help. Bernard Schwartz, a private investor and donor to the former vice president's campaign, said he spoke with Biden within the last two weeks and encouraged him to do just that.

""People out there need some assurance that he has other, additional funds that he expects to come in,"" Schwartz said.

This story has been updated with the Biden campaign's response to the creation of a potential super PAC."

The New Jersey Democrat pointed to Biden's diminished fundraising and sliding support in some polls as signs that the former vice president's campaign has weakened.

""I'm getting calls from people, Biden supporters, who want to hedge their bet,"" Booker said. But he did not point to any factors that might be contributing to doubts about Biden, and noted he maintains ""a tremendous amount of respect"" for the former vice president.

Booker's remarks came in response to reports this week of some angst-ridden Democrats fretting about the primary field as it stands today. In a time-honored tradition of presidential primaries, the political hand-wringing has included some chatter about late entrants to the already saturated field, according to those reports.

Decades of harsh laws and sentencing requirements have ""disproportionately targeted people of color and ruined the lives of millions of Americans,"" Sanders said in a statement. ""When we're in the White House, we're going to end the greed and corruption of the big corporations and make sure that Americans hit hardest by the war on drugs will be the first to benefit from legalization.""

Sanders unveiled the blueprint ahead of his appearance Saturday at the Second Step Presidential Justice Forum at Benedict College, an HBCU in South Carolina. The proposal takes a number of specific steps to address the disproportionately destructive impact federal drug policy has had on the African American community. The capital grant program will be would be administered through the Minority Business Development Agency.

As part of the plan, Sanders would create a federal clemency board to deal with past marijuana-related convictions, similar to a panel established in California. That body would instruct state and federal authorities to review all applicable cases to determine if a new or vacated sentence is required. It would also give prosecutors one year to appeal any decision, after which those convictions would be immediately vacated or expunged.

The 2020 Democratic candidates broadly agree on the need to reverse or roll back current drug laws. Decriminalizing possession and reducing sentencing guidelines, at the least, are popular among many of the leading primary contenders. But there is some disagreement over the scope of the reforms being suggested.

Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren have said they would effectively legalize marijuana by executive action, with Sanders pledging to do it in his first 100 days in office. Their Senate colleague Cory Booker has been a leading reform advocate and his Marijuana Justice Bill counts Sanders, Warren, Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Michael Bennet among its co-sponsors.

South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg supports decriminalizing the possession of all drugs including marijuana, and said Wednesday during a visit to a marijuana dispensary in Nevada that past marijuana convictions should be expunged. Former Vice President Joe Biden does not back full legalization, saying he would leave that decision to the states. He would downgrade marijuana's federal classification, to schedule II, which is the same as cocaine.

At Sanders' rally this past weekend in Queens, the first after he returned to the campaign following a heart attack, he teased a plan to free prisoners convicted of certain drug-related crimes.

""We are going to end the horrifically destructive war on drugs and legalize marijuana,"" Sanders said, tying the cause to a broader criminal and racial justice message. ""And we are going to end the disgrace of 400,000 people right now locked behind bars because they are too poor to afford cash bail.""

In seeking to prevent major corporations from seizing on wider scale legalization, Sanders plans to incentive marijuana growers and distributors who choose to start non-profit or community co-op businesses that would benefit local economies. Existing companies that sell tobacco and cigarettes, along with those ""that have created cancer-causing products or (are) guilty of deceptive marketing"" would be locked out of the market, according to the Sanders plan.

At an event in Iowa in September, the Vermont independent promised that he was going to shift the bounty of marijuana sales from big corporations to the people who have been most heavily impacted by current, or only recently reversed, drug laws.

""I go to Nevada, and there are these big billboards, I don't know if you've seen, and it says buy this or that brand of marijuana, have you seen this? They are advertising hemp,"" Sanders said. ""And I'm thinking that there are people in jail for doing exactly what these large corporations are doing, selling marijuana."""

Follow here for live analysis.,2019-10-23,CNN,CNN's latest poll on 2020 Democrats,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/cnn-poll-10-23-2019/index.html,"One of the more interesting bits of conventional wisdom this primary season has been the belief that a lot of Biden’s primary advantage has to do with name recognition. Following this theory to its logical conclusion, Biden would lose ground as the primary season goes on.

Yet Biden’s mostly held his 30%. (Warren’s been gaining ground mostly at the expense of other candidates.)

Indeed, outside of some big event, our poll suggests that Biden’s floor may be stabler than others.

The majority of his voters (59%) say they will definitely support Biden in his fight for the Democratic nomination. Only 41% say they might change their mind.

For all voters of the other candidates, it’s reversed: 40% say they will definitely back their candidate and 60% say they might change their mind.

When you take a look at the horserace among voters who say they have definitely made up their mind, it’s Biden at 47%, Sanders at 25% and Warren at 11%. Among those who say they might change their mind, it’s Warren at 25%, Biden at 24% and Sanders and Buttigieg at 8%.

This looks very similar to what we saw in our last poll of likely caucusgoers in Iowa: Biden and Sanders do best among those who are certain of their choice. Warren does far worse.

That makes some sense, given Warren has gained a lot of supporters recently, and they may be more likely to switch away from her. Meanwhile, Biden and Sanders backers have been with their candidates for longer."

His next target: America,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/23/business/paytm-vijay-shekhar-sharma-risk-takers/index.html,"To say that Vijay Shekhar Sharma is ambitious is an understatement. The founder of Paytm, India's largest digital payments company, has already revolutionized the way 400 million people spend money — whether it's buying dinner, paying an electric bill or sending money to a friend.

Over the course of his career, he's also ventured into online retail, banking and even gaming.

But he's not done yet. Sharma wants to bring at least half a billion Indians into the banking system through Paytm's app. He also wants to put Paytm on the global map alongside the Googles and Facebooks of the world.

His business philosophy is fuelled by a phrase that echoes throughout Paytm's office in Noida, an industrial hub on the outskirts of New Delhi: ""Go Big or Go Home."" The concept is driven home on a frosted glass wall of Paytm's main boardroom, on office stationery and on countless coffee mugs in its pantry.

It's an outlook that has helped Sharma, 41, grow Paytm into a company valued at $15 billion in less than a decade.

But with that growth comes the risk of doing too much too fast.

Paytm is fighting battles with deep-pocketed rivals on several fronts, and losing those battles could mean missing a huge opportunity. India already has more than 600 million internet users, but, crucially, there are nearly 800 million Indians yet to go online for the first time

Sharma has a sizeable war chest of his own, thanks to investors like Chinese tech giant Alibaba, Japanese behemoth SoftBank and Warren Buffett. But even so, Paytm is dwarfed by the companies it is trying to fend off — Google, Facebook, Amazon and Walmart— all of which have already spent billions of dollars trying to get a piece of the action in India.

That hasn't stopped Sharma from wanting to take the fight to them. He has started a push to take Paytm global, with all roads leading to the United States and a battle with a fresh set of competitors including Venmo, Square and Apple Pay.

A decade of driving digital payments

In India, Paytm is best known as a one-stop shop for digital payments. You can use it to send money to a friend, like Venmo, or to pay for anything from bus tickets to utility bills using your smartphone.

Millions of shopkeepers across India also now accept Paytm, prominently displaying QR codes that can be scanned with the phone's camera to pay for purchases.

""What we've changed in this country is that now you don't need to actually carry a wallet, or a card, or a currency,"" Sharma told CNN Business.

Paytm's journey began back in 2000, when Sharma founded its parent company, One97 Communications . One97 started as a mobile services platform offering horoscopes to cellular network providers before expanding into other services like voice-based gaming and customized ringtones.

Paytm came a decade later, launched in 2010 as a platform for buying prepaid cellphone plans and paying cable bills online.

""Vijay was at an interesting crossroads. He was the majority shareholder in One97... the company was growing well and very profitable,"" said Ravi Adusumalli, a managing partner at private equity firm SAIF Partners and One97's first institutional investor.

""He could have easily sold the company and retired, or he could invest 100% of his net worth into creating a new company,"" added Adusumalli, who serves on One97's board of directors. ""He clearly made the right choice, but it wasn't obvious at the time.""

What we've changed in this country is that now you don't need to actually carry a wallet, or a card, or a currency."" Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder of Paytm

The One97 board wasn't convinced Sharma should invest aggressively in a consumer business, since all of its previous endeavors had been B2B. India's smartphone boom had yet to take off, and the country had fewer than 140 million internet users. But Adusumalli said the board compromised and gave Sharma a small amount of money to invest and see how it went. Sharma also put in $2 million of his own money to get Paytm off the ground.

""When the results came back positive, my recommendation was to 'go big or go home,'"" said Adusumalli. ""Trying to do something incremental would lead to certain failure, so he needed to decide whether he wanted to risk One97 for Paytm.""

It was Sharma's first big risk. Had Paytm failed to take off in the way it did, it could have doomed the company he'd spent a decade building. Missing the boat on India's internet boom would have been difficult to recover from.

The milestones for Sharma have kept coming. In 2012, Paytm got approval from India's central bank to launch the mobile wallet that now forms the core of its business. In 2014, it partnered with Uber to become a payment option for the company's cab rides across India, and in 2015 it snagged another big partnership with the online booking portal for Indian Railways, which sells nearly 700,000 tickets a day and 25 million tickets a year.

But the app really exploded in November 2016, when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi suddenly banned the country's two biggest currency notes — around 86% of the country's cash at the time — with the aim of cracking down on tax evasion and illegal wealth.

The move shocked India's economy , where vast the majority of transactions are made in cash. Millions of people spent weeks lining up at ATMs to exchange their currency notes just so they would have enough money for everyday expenses.

But those who had smartphones started switching to mobile payment apps, and Paytm was primed and ready. The app signed 10 million new users within a month of the cash ban, going from adding tens of thousands of people a day to around half a million.

The cash ban ""made us a folklore name in this country,"" Sharma said. And while its rate of growth is no longer as rapid as it was back then, Paytm has more than doubled its user base in the last two and a half years to 400 million.

Paytm's growth is reflected in digital payments overall as well. The average number of cashless payments per person per year in India has gone from 2.4 to 22.4 in the last five years, according to a report commissioned by the country's central bank published in May.

But cash still rules. Despite the growth of digital payments, the value of currency in circulation increased by 17% to more than 21 trillion rupees ($296 billion) in the past financial year, according to the central bank. That's around ten times the value of mobile payment transactions over the same period.

""India remains a largely cash-driven economy. Economic growth has been possible through many transactions that are done primarily in cash,"" the report said.

""The biggest challenge that we face comes from customers' ability or intent to pay digitally,"" Sharma said. ""Paytm and the mobile payment has taken off, but still there is a huge amount of resistance.""

Driven by ambition

Sharma grew up in Aligarh, a small town about 100 miles south of India's capital, New Delhi. He finished high school by the time he was 14 and graduated from the Delhi College of Engineering at age 19, according to a blog post on Paytm's website.

But Sharma didn't speak much English and struggled to understand what was being taught in class. He got through college by reading two versions of the textbooks — one in English and the other in his native Hindi. He would also spend a lot of time in the college computer lab, according to the blog post, ""browsing the internet and dreaming about being in Silicon Valley.""

By the time he graduated, Sharma had taught himself to code and already had his first startup under his belt. He cofounded a company called XS Communications that made content management systems used by several major Indian publications. The company was sold to a US entrepreneur for $1 million in 1999.

He spent the next year trying to set up One97, taking on significant debt that he paid off by doing odd jobs like setting up internet connections for paying customers. It would take nearly two decades for him to become one of India's youngest billionaires and a household name in the country. To many Indians, he is the recognizable face of the digital payments company he founded. ( Forbes has his net worth at $2.4 billion.)

""Vijay is the heart and soul of Paytm. He honestly never stops with new ideas,"" said Adusumalli.

Big battles at home

Paytm will need every ounce of Sharma's ambition in the coming months in order to hold on to its dominant position in India, as the biggest names in tech and retail use their deep pockets to eat into business on his home turf.

Google launched its digital payment service, Google Pay, in India two years ago , and has signed up more than 67 million users. PhonePe, owned by Walmart, has 150 million users. Amazon also has its own digital payment platform, Amazon Pay, and added person-to-person digital payments earlier this year.

And an even bigger rival is waiting in the wings. WhatsApp, the mobile messaging app owned by Facebook, which has more than 400 million users in India, is gearing up to launch its own payments service

These companies already have large user bases for their core services, which gives them a running start when trying to add users to their payment platforms.

""The biggest challenge [for Paytm] will be from the competition point of view — to make sure people stay on their platform,"" says Tarun Pathak, an analyst at Counterpoint Research.

Paytm wants to offer more services to its millions of users, starting with an e-commerce portal called Paytm Mall, backed by Alibaba. Launched in 2017, it's aimed at cashing in on India's online retail market, which Morgan Stanley forecasts will be worth $200 billion by 2027.

But while Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart have taken over the market and disrupted India's millions of smaller retailers, Paytm Mall has failed to make much of an inroad. The platform has a little over 3% of the Indian market, compared to more than 30% each for Amazon and Flipkart.

There are other potential hurdles as well: New Indian regulations requiring digital payment firms to do more background checks on their consumers could drastically increase costs. Heavy regulations govern Paytm's other businesses, including banking, loans and insurance. One97 is also racking up losses — its total loss in the financial year that ended in March 2019 was nearly 40 billion rupees ($560 million), a 165% increase from the previous year, according to multiple media reports . It also reportedly has around $96 million in debt.

""We have invested more in consumer and merchant growth,"" a company spokesperson said, adding that it aims to reduce losses by ""more than 25%"" this year.

But Sharma is confident he can make it all work. He's practically evangelical about helping bring millions of Indians into the mainstream banking system.

""I say to my team that our mission is so pious that God will give us a way to do what we want to do,"" he said. ""I believe that God above will take care of us, giants will give way and stumbling blocks will disappear on our way.""

In fact, he wants to start preparing for an initial public offering by the end of next year.

Going global

Sharma's latest bet is not a new business but a new country. Last year, he teamed up with Yahoo! Japan and one of Paytm's biggest investors, SoftBank, to launch a mobile payment app called PayPay in Japan. The app signed up 10 million users and brought a million stores onto its platform in its first 10 months, and Sharma wants to cash in on a huge influx of tourists for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

Samsung SSNLF Line LN But it's a big leap for a cash-obsessed country: 80% of transactions in Japan still use cash, and even the digital payment pie is split between big players like, Apple and popular messaging app. While the early signs for Paytm have been encouraging, it's a long road ahead.

""It is tough to convince a Japanese business unless they are totally convinced. And there is not a 'let me try' attitude there; it has to work perfectly well,"" Sharma told CNN Business in early August.

I say to my team that our mission is so pious that God will give us a way to do what we want to do. I believe that God above will take care of us, giants will give way and stumbling blocks will disappear on our way."" Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder of Paytm

He makes no secret of his global ambitions. Every meeting room on Paytm's main floor is named after a major global city: New York, London, Seoul, Barcelona, Dubai.

There's also Hangzhou, the headquarters of Paytm's biggest investor Alibaba. ""That's for Jack Ma,"" he said, referring to Alibaba's billionaire co-founder. ""And we have Tokyo for Masa Son,"" the CEO of SoftBank.

Berkshire Hathaway BRKA There's also an Omaha room, he added, where legendary investor Warren Buffett is based. Paytm last year became the first Indian company that Buffett'sinvested in.

Sharma told CNN Business last year that he wants to get all three men in the same room for a board meeting. But he has an even bigger dream.

""Look, the ultimate dreamland for tech entrepreneurs is if America becomes a market,"" he said. ""For us, it's an ambition, very outspokenly stated, that we would love to be a part of the American economy where we can serve American citizens.""

Sharma is already fighting several battles at home and abroad, but he's confident that he can make it happen.

""The success of Japan tells us that our technology is up to that mark ... just like where we got Masa Son as a partner in Japan, if we get some partner like that, we're headed to the US soon,"" he said. ""We would love to start the journey ASAP, but we would have to build our finances well for [the] US market... inshallah if it happens soon, then we are going to do it soon.""

Adusumalli, who says his founder-investor relationship with Sharma has evolved into a ""strong friendship with a great deal of mutual trust,"" says the United States is still far behind countries like China when it comes to online payments, creating a potential opportunity for Paytm.

Only 55 million people in the United States used mobile payments last year, according to research firm eMarketer — about 20% of the population. That's just a fraction of China's 525 million users . Even India, where less than half the population uses smartphones, had around 74 million people making mobile payments, eMarketer said

""While India is a large and growing market, it requires a great deal of patience. The U.S. is appealing because it is a massive market and payments are antiquated relative to what is happening in China,"" he said. ""Vijay sees an opportunity to being a disruptor in a market that is very profitable for incumbents.""

It would be a huge bet — but Sharma is used to seeing those pay off.

""I think I've been lucky that in my life I had to take risks without even thinking of downfalls because I did not start with a lot of things that I could have lost,"" he said.

Clues about how he approaches risk are all over the walls of Paytm's offices. ""Just because they say it's impossible doesn't mean you can't do it,"" reads one poster. ""No bird soars in a calm,"" reads another.

""If you don't give yourself a chance, who will? If you don't take a chance, who will?"" Sharma says. ""And I think you should take a chance on you."""

This year, month after month, he has drawn most of the major presidential candidates to his doorstep and championed ""Medicare for All"" while forcing the presidential contenders to think through the impact of their health care agendas in the most personal terms.

He brought California Sen. Kamala Harris to tears recalling the day her mother was diagnosed with colon cancer. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren used Barkan's case to punctuate the failures of the healthcare system during a July presidential debate: ""Ady has health insurance, good health insurance, and it's not nearly enough,"" she said.

Barkan and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the author of the Medicare for All legislation, discussed their legacies during their conversation, which was posted online in early September.

""In terms of your legacy, Ady,"" Sanders told Barkan, ""I think it will be very clear that even with the terrible illness that you're struggling with right now, that you didn't give up, that you understood that -- especially given your illness -- that you could play a significant in rallying the American people toward a sane and humane health care system.""

In the latest interview released Thursday with Pete Buttigieg , the South Bend, Indiana Mayor told Barkan that it was the first time he'd been around breathing equipment since the death of his father, who had cancer, in January.

""We sat down with a social worker who basically explained to us at the hospital that in terms of long term care our best option was probably for our family to spend down everything that we had until we were asset-poor enough to qualify for Medicaid,"" Buttigieg told Barkan, according to the transcript shared with CNN. ""I remember just thinking, is that how this works in America?""

The two debated their differing views on Medicare for All, and Barkan told Buttigieg he appreciated that the mayor was ""willing to have the tough conversations even when someone doesn't agree with you.""

In their exchange, Barkan called out former Vice President Joe Biden, who Barkan says is the only top-tier presidential candidate who has not responded to his invitation to meet.

On September 18, he issued a searing plea to Biden, noting that Biden has his own heartbreaking struggles involving the healthcare system (most recently with the death of his son Beau in 2015 from a brain tumor).

""Mr. Vice President you know about illness. You know about doctors and hospitals. You know that health care is personal. ... You won't come talk to me about it?"" Barkan said in video missive to Biden the day before undergoing surgery for a tracheostomy to help him breathe. ""Look a dying man in the eyes and tell me how we fix this country.""

In an interview with CNN this month, Barkan described ALS as ""the story of things becoming impossible"" -- from a simple stroll around the neighborhood to his ability to tickle his 3-year-old son Carl. ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, ultimately depriving the brain of its ability to initiate and control muscle movement, including the loss of speech. (Barkan now speaks through a computer).

""It's exhausting and overwhelming,"" Barkan told CNN. ""For me, ALS has been a lesson in exactly how broken our health care system is and why it's so important to fix it.""

In this family photo, Barkan is pictured with his wife Rachael and son Carl in October 2016.

Barkan, a life-long advocate on economic justice issues who was diagnosed with ALS in October 2016, has imparted those lessons not only with high-profile testimony in Washington, but also in these intimate one-on-one conversations with candidates.

He and his crew film publish the interviews as part of the work of their PAC, the Be A Hero fund, which attempts to hold politicians accountable on health care and other issues by using the stories of average Americans as their persuasion tool.

Barkan realized the power of his exchanges with politicians when he met former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake by chance in December 2017 on an airplane. Overwhelmed by his mounting medical bills, Barkan urged Flake not to support the GOP tax bill, which he believed would disrupt his health care coverage. ""You can save my life,"" Barkan told Flake in a n exchange captured by a fellow passenger . ""Please remember this conversation."" Flake did end up voting for the tax bill -- in contradiction to Barkan's request -- but that exchange vaulted Barkan into the national spotlight.

As Barkan has explained to the current crop of presidential candidates, his insurance company tried to deny coverage for a breathing assistance machine that he needed to live. He said he, his wife Rachael, an assistant and a lawyer spent ""endless time on the phone trying to get our insurance company to behave properly, lawfully. Beyond that, his family is billed $20,000 a month out of pocket for the 24-hour home care that he needs.

""I'm lucky to have wealthy supporters cover the cost for us, but that's not an option for a lot of people -- most just go bankrupt,"" he told CNN, which provided questions to Barkan ahead of time to give him enough time to write out answers.

""Ninety percent of Americans with ALS choose not to go on a ventilator because it requires 24-hour care, which most insurance plans don't cover. In Japan, where long-term care is guaranteed, the numbers are reversed. That just isn't right, and it doesn't need to be this way.""

That view has fueled Barkan's advocacy for Medicare for All, the signature health care proposal from Sanders: ""I've come to believe that fundamentally we need radical, disruptive change to the status quo,"" he said. ""The only plan I've seen that aims for that level of ambition is Medicare for All.""

He believes that any plan that stops short of the promise of Medicare for All -- the kinds of plans that have been proposed by Buttigieg, Biden and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, for example — ""won't deliver the universal coverage or the cost savings that we need.""

Barkan testifies before the House Rules Committee at a hearing on a ""Medicare for All"" bill on Capitol Hill in April 2019.

Barkan, who gets around in a wheelchair, speaks through a vocalizer and takes his meals through a feeding tube in his stomach, has still managed to make his sense of urgency felt through in-depth conversations with Buttigieg, Sanders, Harris, Warren, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, and Julián Castro, the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Barack Obama.

He says Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and businessman Asndrew Yang have also agreed to meet with him. The Be A Hero PAC has started a petition calling on Biden to meet with Barkan. Biden's team did not respond to CNN's query about why the former vice president has not responded to Barkan's invitation.

But Barkan isn't giving up on his hope for a one-on-one with one of the 2020 race's front-runners.

It's a persistence that New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez notes in the prologue she wrote for his new memoir, ""Eyes to the Wind.""

Even through his vocalizer, Barkan's testimony to Congress ""forced an urgency and moral clarity that members could not look away from or ignore,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote.

""I saw their discomfort at issuing the usual excuses, and Ady also would not tolerate them—even with many physical capabilities gone,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote.

The New York Democrat first met Barkan when he stopped by a labor town hall that she was holding at a church in the Bronx after winning her primary election last year. He could still speak at that point and she held the microphone for him as he addressed the crowd.

They met again this year, at her congressional office after the his testimony to Congress.

Barkan acknowledges that part of the power of his advocacy is that he is dying from ALS, a fact he points out in his Twitter profile. He told CNN he is ""trying to use the time I have left here to make things better for as long as I still can.""

""If I could be healthy and completely anonymous, I would do it in a heartbeat,"" he said. But because of his illness, his activism with Be a Hero and the Center for Popular Democracy have drawn national notice. His team went on to travel the country making health-care ads that he said were among the top-performing spots of 2018.

""We built a platform that made it hard for candidates to ignore us,"" Barkan said. ""There are millions of folks who the candidates should sit down with. I'm just hoping I can be a voice for them and force candidates to answer questions that really matter to people."""

""They seemed like hustlers -- but not in a bad way. In a good way,"" one high-ranking Republican operative familiar with the pair told CNN.

But a CNN review of campaign contributions and court filings, as well as interviews with nearly a dozen people with knowledge of Parnas and Fruman's interactions, tell a different story. The pair raked in hundreds of thousands of dollars and jetted around the world touting their connections to Giuliani and the Trump administration while pushing for business and favors, even claiming to arrange a Fox News interview, right up until the day they were arrested for conspiracy and campaign-finance related charges.

At one point, they pushed a Ukrainian businessman to pay them to bring Trump administration officials to Ukraine. At another time, they convinced a Florida-based businessman to loan them $100,000 so they could connect him with Giuliani and other prominent conservatives. And in a third instance, they attempted to influence the management board of a Ukrainian gas company.

""They presented themselves as successful businesspeople with business interests across the country and in Europe,"" said the GOP source, who requested anonymity, citing the ongoing criminal probe into the men. ""They just said they loved the President and what he's doing.""

When the pair made a $325,000 donation to a pro-Trump super PAC in May 2018, they were subjected to standard vetting designed to detect any problems or conflicts with major donors, the source said.

""They didn't find any reason why we shouldn't take their money,"" said the Republican with knowledge of the matter. ""So we did.""

On the day the indictment was unsealed, the PAC itself said, ""America First Action takes our legal obligations seriously and scrupulously complies with the law,"" according to a statement issued by the group the day the indictment was unsealed.

But the pair's business and networking activities over the past year had raised red flags with several prominent businessmen and their attorneys, CNN has learned.

Parnas and Fruman were in federal court on Wednesday after being arrested several weeks earlier in a corridor at Dulles airport near Lufthansa departing flights. They pleaded not guilty to allegations of funneling Russian money into Nevada politics and of circumventing federal campaign finance laws to make straw donations to advance the political interests of at least one Ukrainian official, including the $325,000 donation to the pro-Trump PAC, America First Action.

Defense attorneys for Parnas and Fruman declined to comment for this story on Wednesday.

Bruce Marks, an attorney in Philadelphia who represents prominent Eastern Europeans, told CNN in recent days there was a Russian proverb that applied to Fruman and Parnas.

""Don't go in the forest if you're afraid of wolves,"" Marks said. ""And these guys, they just weren't wolves, I mean they were radioactive wolves.""

Marks represents the Ukrainian billionaire Ihor Kolomoisky, who is a major supporter of the new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In the lead-up to Zelensky's inauguration this May, Parnas and Fruman approached Kolomoisky during a trip to Israel.

They wanted a six-figure payment, Marks said, and in exchange they told the billionaire they could set up a meeting between Zelensky and a delegation of American officials.

""My recollection is that they were talking about Vice President Pence, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, and they said that they needed to have money in order to ensure that they would come,"" Marks told CNN. They also touted their connection to Giuliani to the Ukrainian businessman, Marks said.

""They were going to be responsible for arranging for American government officials to come to Mr. Zelensky's inauguration,"" he added.

Kolomoisky refused, Marks said.

There was no indication that Pence, Perry or anyone in the Trump administration or Ukrainian government were aware of those efforts.

Perry and State Department officials did travel to Ukraine for the inauguration, arranged through official government channels.

Search for cash

It wasn't the only time Parnas and Fruman tried to use their connections to Giuliani to push for cash. In March of this year, they pitched their influence and ties to Trump's administration to a Ukrainian gas executive at an energy conference in Houston

And they've been spotted in years of photos alongside Giuliani, Trump and even other lawyers to the President. Giuliani did not return multiple requests for comment on this story.

Over the past year, the pair hustled for hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans and payments.

In the fall of 2018, Parnas was telling his wealthy contacts that he was short on cash and seeking loans, according to three people familiar with his requests. Among his alleged troubles, one source said, was that he needed money to pay Giuliani to be a spokesperson for one of Parnas' companies. Giuliani has said he was retained by that company to provide business and legal advice because of his related experience.

That wasn't their only ask. South Florida attorney Robert Stok told CNN in an interview that Parnas and Fruman came to a wealthy client of his seeking money, claiming they were so short on cash they couldn't even pay for Parnas' newborn son's bris.

Stok said the men asked Felix Vulis, a Russian-American natural resources magnate, if he could kick in some money for the event.

They had also promised to open doors for Vulis through their connections to Giuliani and others, including the Washington lobbyist Brian Ballard, the former chief of staff to Mike Pence Nick Ayers and others. This added to Parnas and Fruman's credibility with Vulis.

Vulis was intrigued enough to loan them $100,000, writing a check to Parnas' company Global Energy Producers in October 2018, which included a memo for a ""loan to Igor and Lev (two month),"" according to Stok and other records reviewed by CNN.

""The thing that made him really pull the trigger was the fact he felt sorry for them, because of their financial constraints,"" Stok said. Any proposed networking in Republican circles never happened, Stok said.

When they were slow to repay, Vulis sued. Vulis told their since-indicted associate David Correia over text message he had been ripped off, and that he planned to tell Giuliani, Ayers and others that Parnas and Fruman would face a lawsuit. Correia pleaded not guilty.

Parnas and Fruman fought the case for months but ultimately repaid the debt a few weeks before Giuliani publicly admitted to asking Ukraine for political help, a key early development in the House impeachment inquiry. The exact details of their settlement with Vulis remain private.

This August, ""all of a sudden they were able to fork over a check,"" Stok said.

An aborted trip to Vienna

Two weeks ago when they were arrested, Parnas and Fruman were preparing to fly to Vienna, Austria, to meet Giuliani and another key figure in the impeachment investigation, Ukraine's former prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, according to four sources familiar with their trip. Shokin is the same Ukrainian official who former Vice President Joe Biden -- along with other Western leaders -- had pushed to have removed over concerns he wasn't prosecuting corruption.

While questions in Washington swirl around Shokin's role in this controversy, Giuliani, Parnas, Fruman had specific plans for the former Ukrainian official up until the day of their arrest. According to those four sources, they told others they were headed to Vienna to help with a planned interview the next day: Shokin, they said, was scheduled to do an interview from the Austrian capital with Sean Hannity.

Through a spokesperson, Hannity said that ""we never reveal our sources, potential sources, or persons they may or may not request to interview. Sean Hannity takes the first amendment seriously."""

Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) slow, steady rise in national polls is hitting a snag, as the latest National Emerson College poll shows the presidential hopeful falling to third place, behind Joe Biden (D) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).

The post-debate survey, taken October 18-21, 2019, among 430 Democrat primary voters, shows Biden regaining his frontrunner status with 27 percent support. Sanders, who has struggled in recent national polls, saw a spike, jumping to second place with 25 percent support. The survey shows the Massachusetts senator dropping to third place with 21 percent support. With a margin of error of +/- 4.7 percent, the three are statistically tied.

The poll reflects Sen. Kamala Harris’s (D-CA) continued tailspin, dropping behind Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s (D), who saw six percent support to Harris’s five percent. Andrew Yang (D) experienced a slight bump, garnering four percent support, followed by Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with three percent each. The remaining candidates saw two percent support or less.

Results also show that Sanders, who just received the formal endorsement of young, freshman socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), continues to have a stronghold on younger voters (18-29) with 45 percent of their support. No one else comes close, as Warren gains 17 percent support from that age group, and Yang is right behind her, earning 15 percent support. While Biden only sees 12 percent support among young voters, his backing increases exponentially among older voters. He is garnering 17 percent support from those aged 30-49 and 44 percent support from those 50 and older.

The economy remains the most important issue for 31 percent of voters in deciding whom to support in the presidential election, “followed by social issues at 14%, healthcare at 13%, impeachment at 11%, immigration at 10% and the environment at 8%,” according to the poll’s results.

“Gun policy and education are tied at 5%, and foreign policy is the least important issue for voters at 4%,” it adds."

Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) frontrunner status does not appear to have lasted longer than the time it takes to boil water.

The big news today is a poll from the far-left CNN, which shows former Vice President Joe Biden surging to a 34 to 19 percent lead over Warren, with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) hanging on — heart attack and all — to third place with 16 percent support.

Granted, this is only one poll, and it is CNN, but if Biden is indeed at 34 percent nationally, that is about where a frontrunner needs to be. Thirty-five percent is considered the safe zone in a crowded race.

While I don’t have an enormous amount of faith in CNN’s polling, comparing the trends within a particular poll is always useful, and those look especially bad for America’s Favorite Fake Indian. Since June, in this same poll, Warren’s favorability number has climbed just two points, from 36 to 38 percent, but her unfavorable rating has also climbed, from 38 to 41 percent.

Most importantly, she is upside down on favorability, 38 to 41 percent, and the only top tier Democrat candidate with that problem.

By comparison, Sanders enjoys 48 to 45 percent favorability rating. Mayor Pete Buttigieg is right-side up at 28 to 23 percent. Joe Biden enjoys an incredible advantage at 74 to 20 percent.

On the top four issues of the day, Biden enjoys a wide lead among Democrats. On foreign policy, 56 percent say Biden will do the best job, compared to 13 percent for Sanders and just 11 percent for Warren. On the economy, it’s Biden 38 percent, Sanders 19 percent, and Warren 16 percent. On guns , it’s Biden 27 percent, Sanders 13 percent, and Warren 11 percent. On immigration, it’s Biden 29 percent, with Warren and Sanders tied at 16 percent.

In worse news for Chief Lies-Like-a-Rug, Warren is slipping everywhere else. Two weeks ago, in the Real Clear Politics poll of polls, Warren was tied with Biden nationally and even led in a number of polls.

In the seven most recent polls, however, Biden has a steady lead; in six of those polls he leads anywhere from 8 to 15 points.

The real problem for Warren, though, is that she wilts under scrutiny. As soon as the “frontrunner” status swung the spotlight her way, everything that makes Elizabeth Warren a terrible candidate was once again magnified times ten.

On top of her extremist policies, she’s a weak, shrill, dishonest neurotic. During this last debate, there was nothing to instill confidence among those looking for someone tough enough to take on Trump, especially when she dissembled over and over again when asked a simple question about how she intends to pay for her Medicare For All plan without raising taxes on the middle class.

The primary thing voters look for in a candidate is strength and competence. Are they strong, unable to be rattled? Are you the alpha male (or female)? But whenever she’s under pressure Warren unravels like Lucy Ricardo when Ricky catches her sneaking into his nightclub.

In short, Elizabeth Warren is a mess. This was obvious — hell, everything was obvious about Warren’s inability to handle pressure after she bungled the release of her DNA results last year. As I said at the time, that was the single worst political debacle since John McCain suspended his 2008 presidential campaign to run off and save the economy. She made a fool of herself, and that is almost impossible to overcome.

For that reason, I was legitimately surprised when she became the frontrunner earlier this month, but I was not at all surprised when she immediately fell apart as soon as the scrutiny arrived.

She just doesn’t have The Stuff.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) took her 2020 campaign for the Democrat presidential nomination to Chicago on Tuesday, where she joined striking members of the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) on the picket lines.

Warren said in a speech delivered to a crowd of teachers gathered on the picket lines in West Chicago:

I’m here to stand for America’s public schools. I’m here to stand with Chicago’s teachers. I’m here to stand with Chicago nurses. I’m here to stand with Chicago’s librarians. I’m here to stand with Chicago’s bus drivers. I’m here to stand with the low wage workers in the Chicago schools. I also am here to stand with our unions. To stand with SEIU, to stand with CTU, and here’s why–because the unions are how we have a voice. The unions are how we have power.

“The unions are how we make sure that the needs of every one of our children are heard loud and clear,” she added.

The Chicago Tribune reported Warren’s appearance came “hours after union President Jesse Sharkey accused Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration of ‘vindictive actions’ for suggesting the union go back to work without a contract and saying there was no more money for teacher demands.”

The strike began on Thursday morning, and Tuesday is the fourth day that classes have been cancelled for the 361,000 students who attend the Chicago Public Schools.

In her speech, Warren made no mention of the dismal academic performance of those students when compared to the national average, or the role the striking teachers have in failing to improve that performance.

Earlier in her speech, Warren said, “everyone in America should support you in this strike. And the reason is because when you go out and fight, you don’t just fight for yourselves, you fight for the children of this city, and the children of this country,” adding:

I believe in public education, and I believe it is time in America to make a new investment in public education. And I got a plan for that. America’s public schools need a partner in Washington.Not a partner who’s going to tell them what to do. Not a partner who’s going to do high stakes testing. Not a partner who’s going to pinch pennies. But a partner who’s going to be there, to back you up in the critically important work you do every day. And for me, that start’s with an $800 billion investment in our public schools. It starts with quadrupling our funding for title one schools. Let’s level the playing field. It starts with full funding for IDEA for all of our children who are in special education. And it starts with a grant to every single public school in this country so that that public school can decide how to spend the money that it needs to provide the first rate education for the children it has.

CTU President Jesse Sharkey made it clear on Tuesday he intends to play hard ball with Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Chicago Public Schools (CPS) to get more money for the 25,000 teachers in his union, as The Tribune reported:

In an email sent [to the Tribune] after midnight, Sharkey said, “Our bargaining team was beginning to see glimmers of progress on issues that matter to our members. (Monday) that progress stopped dead. “It was clear from the mayor’s letter to the press demanding members go back to work without a contract and from the sudden atmosphere of stonewalling from the CPS team, that (Lightfoot) had pulled the plug on negotiations,” Sharkey continued. “The mayor’s team said that there was no more money in the budget to address the many outstanding demands that are necessary to deliver justice for our school communities,” he said.

Tuesday’s rally was kicked off by Brandon Johnson, who declared he is “a proud member of the Chicago Teachers Union. I am also proud to be the Cook County Commissioner of the First District.”

Johnson said:

This moment has been brought to you by the largest political resistance that we’ve seen in a generation. For those that have taken us for granted for the last 35 years, the Chicago Teachers Union and SEIU we’re saying enough is enough. We’re not going to turn back now.

“We are going to secure economic justice today,” he added,

Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, the national union with which the CTU is affiliated, also addressed the crowd:

I feel like I have been in Chicago so much the last few weeks that I probably have to start paying property taxes. It shouldn’t have taken, as [CTU President] Jesse [Sharkey] said, to the brink of a strike in order to have real negotiations. There were more negotiations in the first two days of the strike than in the last ten months, that’s what’s wrong with this bargaining process.

Elizabeth Warren topping the field with 28 percent of the vote and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) slowly regaining his footing.

The poll, taken October 17-21, 2019, among 713 Democrat voters and Democrat-leaning independents, found Warren in the lead with 28 percent support, followed by Biden, who fell seven points behind with 21 percent support.

One of the most significant takeaways from the poll is Sanders’ slow regain, coming in third place with 15 percent support. The last Quinnipiac University Poll, taken prior to the October 15 debate, showed Sanders polling at 11 percent.

The poll also shows Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with a notable boost, coming in fourth place with ten percent support, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) with five percent support. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) garnered three percent support, with the remaining candidates seeing two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.6 percent.

While voters still view Biden as the most viable candidate in a matchup against Trump, that position is slipping.

According to Quinnipiac:

Biden is still viewed as the candidate who has the best chance of winning against Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, but he is not as strong on this question as he once was. In today’s poll, Biden gets 42 percent, but this is down from 48 percent in the October 14 poll and his high of 56 percent in an April 30 poll. Warren comes in second on this electability question with 20 percent, followed by Sanders at 14 percent. Sanders is viewed as the most honest Democratic candidate for president by 28 percent of Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, followed by Biden and Warren who receive 15 percent apiece, and Buttigieg with 11 percent. Sanders and Warren are at the top on the question of which candidate “cares most about people like you,” as Sanders gets 28 percent, Warren receives 24 percent, and Biden gets 14 percent.

The October Quinnipiac University Poll showed Warren with 30 percent to Biden’s 27 percent, indicating that Sanders’ slow regain is affecting the top two candidates in an impactful way.

“Former Vice President Joe Biden slips, Senator Elizabeth Warren steadies, Senator Bernie Sanders gets his groove back, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg breaks back into double digits,” Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow said of the poll’s results.

Warren’s extended lead over Biden and Sanders’ bump follows a CNN poll released this week, showing the former vice president as the clear frontrunner with 34 percent to Warren’s 19 percent and Sanders’ 16 percent."

Harris is struggling to regain the top-tier status she once held early in her campaign. While the presidential hopefuls are vying to win over early primary state voters, a candidate’s support in their respective home state – particularly among those who are currently serving as a lawmaker – can speak volumes.

The California lawmaker is failing to capture support from residents of her home state, falling to fourth place, a Change Research poll shows.

According to the poll, taken for KQED October 15-18, 2019, among 2,605 Democrat voters, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is leading in the Golden State with 28 percent support, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) with 24 percent, and Joe Biden (D) with 19 percent. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who is beginning to surpass Harris in key national and early caucus state polls, came in fourth place with nine percent support, causing Harris to drop to fifth place with eight percent support.

The gap between Warren and Harris has widened by six points over the last month.

“The October survey puts Harris 20 percentage points behind Sen. Warren, compared with a 14 percentage point gap in our September poll,” KQED reports.

Even among women, Harris falls far behind the top tier, earning just seven percent support from female Democrat voters in her state:

By gender, Warren is the top choice of female voters with 31% support, followed by Sanders with 23% and Biden at 21%. Buttigieg and Harris are the choice of 8% and 7% of women respectively. Among men, Sanders edges out Warren 25% to 23% with Biden third at 16%, followed by Buttigieg at 10% and Harris with 9%.

The poll’s margin of error is +/- 2.4 percent.

The Change Research poll’s results coincide with a Civiqs survey released this week, which shows Harris continuing to fall in Iowa with just three percent support. This is despite her change in strategy, beefing up resources and appearances in the Hawkeye State in recent weeks."

While many Democrats view Biden as the most electable candidate, the survey’s results show Trump defeating Biden 47 percent to 45 percent thanks, in part, to the president closing the gap in support among independent, suburban, and Hispanics voters.

According to Zogby Analytics:

The reason President Trump is winning, barely, in a hypothetical match-up with the former vice president, Joe Biden, is that, in addition to winning with his normal base of men (Trump leads 54% to 39%), white voters (Trump leads 53% to 40%), union voters (Trump leads 62% to 32%), and southern voters (Trump leads 50% to 43%), Trump has also tightened the race with Independents (Biden leads 42% to 36%), suburban voters (Biden leads 49% to 43%), and Hispanics (Biden leads 47% to 43%). Trump is also beating Biden convincingly with two demographics he has recently made inroads with: large city voters (Trump leads 50% to 44%) and Generation X voters age 30-49 (Trump leads 49% to 41%).

Trump also beats Sanders by a two-point margin, 46 percent to 44 percent, although Sanders continues to hold an edge with younger voters (18-29) with 56 percent support to Trump’s 37 percent.

The president appears to perform the best against Buttigieg, who has failed to break through the top tier of candidates in the crowded Democrat field. Trump beats him by 11 points – 49 percent to 38 percent – and defeats Harris 47 percent to 41 percent. The margin of error is +/- 3.3 percent.

Yet Biden’s support jumped ten points from the last poll taken in September, from 24 percent to 34 percent. Warren only increased her support by one percent.

Biden was also targeted by President Donald Trump for corruption in recent weeks, as the president attacked Biden’s son Hunter for his shady foreign business deals in Ukraine and China while his father was vice president.

A big majority of moderate/conservative Democrat voters chose Biden as their first choice; 43 percent to Warren’s 12 percent and Bernie Sanders ten percent.

Fifty-three percent of potential Democrat voters in the poll said that they might change their minds, while 46 percent said that they would definitely support their first choice.

The CNN Poll was conducted from October 17-20 by SSRS of 1,003 adults, 424 registered voters who identified as Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents. The margin of error among potential Democrat voters is +/- 5.8 points."

Omar spoke with Hasan and touched on the state of the 2020 presidential race, offering warm words about the “Warren-wing” of the Democrat Party despite endorsing Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).

“What I also believe is that there is a Warren-wing of our party, and I would say that’s most Democrats,” Omar said, referencing Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

“I mean it’s the one thing that everybody accuses us of. We think we’re the smartest in the room. We are very policy-oriented. We care about the details,” she said, suggesting that voters are unable to completely understand what her party is fighting for.

“Just today we were, you know, fighting about a lot of things that most people can’t understand, and there is that aspect of a Warren that is exciting. She has a plan for everything,” she added:

Despite Omar’s seeming praise of Warren, she reiterated that she is pleased by her choice of endorsing Sanders for president.

“Sometimes you have to be reminded about the vision you truly believe in, and where your core values lie,” Omar said.

“And for me, I know that there are people that have to switch some things around, and there are people that are just easy to believe in. And I was reminded that Bernie is one of the people,” she continued.

Another portion of the interview featured Omar choosing between various pairs of candidates. When asked to choose between “Hillary or Tulsi” Omar said, “None!” She gave the same answer when asked to choose between Joe Biden (D) or Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D).

“But if you had to pick one? If one of them is the candidate for your party, who would you rather it be?” Hasan pressed.

“So you’re saying if something tragic happens and they ended up being the nominee?” Omar replied.

“I don’t know! It’s hard!” she added."

While there has been significant fluctuation in national polling data in recent days, Biden’s fall in the Hawkeye State appears to be consistent with the overall trend.

According to the survey, taken October 18-22, 2019, among 598 likely Democratic Caucus attendees, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is leading the pack with 28 percent support – a four-point jump from last month’s results. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) jumped to second place with 20 percent support, marking a seven-point jump for the South Bend mayor. Buttigieg’s spike coincides with the Suffolk University/USA Today poll released Monday, which showed the presidential hopeful rising to third place with 13 percent support among the crowded field of candidates.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) fell to third place, trailing Buttigieg by two points with 18 percent support. Most significantly, perhaps, is Biden’s fourth-place status, garnering just 12 percent support – a four-point drop from September’s results.

The poll shows Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) in a distant fifth place with four percent support, followed by Tom Steyer (D) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) with three percent support each. Harris’s single-digit support follows weeks of pledging to blitz Iowa, telling one colleague that she was going to “f*cking” move there.

The poll’s margin of error is +/- five percentage points:

Iowa Democratic Caucus: Warren 28 (+4 Since last Month)

Buttigieg 20 (+7)

Sanders 18 (+2)

Biden 12 (-4)

Klobuchar 4 (+1)

Respondents were also asked to choose a second choice candidate.

“If the Democratic Caucuses were held today, which one of the following candidates would be your second choice?” the survey asked.

The order among top-tier candidates remained unchanged. According to the survey, 24 percent chose Warren as their second choice candidate, 14 percent selected Buttigieg, 13 percent chose Sanders, and 10 percent went with Biden."

The Fed announcement came without explanation. Recent Fed offerings for the short term repurchase agreements, or repos, have been oversubscribed, meaning banks sought more liquidity than the Fed was prepared to provide.

On Tuesday, the Fed injected nearly $100 billion in combined overnight and slightly-longer term loans to banks.

Senator Elizabeth Warren recently addressed a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in his role as chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, asking for an explanation for why banks have recently required these huge daily cash infusions.

In a repo operation, banks sell bonds to the Treasury in exchange for cash with an agreement to buy them back the following day or in a couple of weeks, depending on the length of the operation. These are the equivalent of very short term loans.

When the Fed initially stepped into the market following a spike in interest rates for repos in September, the interventions were much smaller and expected to last just a few weeks. Since then, however, the market has demanded increasing amounts of liquidity with no end in sight. It is now considered very likely that such operations could become permanent.

Since the loans are paid back to the Fed after a short period, they are not thought to have any inflationary effect."

Dick’s also prohibited the sale of “high capacity” magazines under Stack’s leadership, and the company raised the minimum age for long gun purchases from 18 to 21 years of age.

On October 6, 2019, Breitbart News reported Dick’s destroyed $5 million worth of “assault-style rifles” following the implementation of their sales ban. They destroyed the rifles to keep them out of private hands

Stack admitted Dick’s gun control stance has resulted in “a quarter of a billion [dollars]” in loses, yet he was considering the enactment of more corporate gun control.

The New York Times on Tuesday ran a piece centering around concerns of establishment Democrats, who are not confident that anyone in the current Democrat field — not Joe Biden (D), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), or Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — could successfully take down President Trump in the 2020 general election.

“Since the last debate, just anecdotally, I’ve had five or six people ask me: ‘Is there anybody else?’” Leah Daughtry, who the Times described as a “longtime Democrat who has run two of the party’s recent conventions,” said.

That is just one example of many. According to the Times, many Democrats — from voters to high-profile lawmakers — are worried about the state of the current Democrat field and are quietly looking for a savior:

“There’s more anxiety than ever,” said Connie Schultz, a journalist who is married to Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, another Democrat who some in the party would like to see join the race. “We’re both getting the calls. I’ve been surprised by some who’ve called me.” “I can see it, I can feel it, I can hear it,” Mitch Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor, said of the unease within the party. He said he thinks Mr. Biden is best positioned to defeat Mr. Trump but called the former vice president’s fund-raising “a real concern.”

Clinton and billionaire Michael Bloomberg are reportedly keeping tabs on the mounting concerns and “have both told people privately in recent weeks that if they thought they could win, they would consider entering the primary,” according to the Times. However, they are “skeptical there would be an opening, according to Democrats who have spoken with them.”

The Times adds that Democrats familiar with their thinking do not see either jumping in unless Biden goes down:

The chances that another major contender decides to run are remote: While Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Bloomberg have both been encouraged to enter the race, Democrats close to them believe the only scenario under which they’d consider running is if Mr. Biden drops out or is badly weakened.

The Washington Post also signaled that a 2020 run for Clinton remains on the table, as Democrats continue to worry about Biden’s mounting baggage and the ultra-liberal policies of his closest contenders.

“Hillary Clinton, according to two people close to her, has not ruled out jumping in herself, a sign that she is hearing similar dissatisfaction,” the Post reported:

Those close to Clinton, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment on her behalf, say she has felt vindicated over the past few weeks as Trump’s political difficulties have deepened. That sentiment was reinforced this week when the State Department announced its probe into emails sent to a private server, a major complication of her 2016 campaign, found no evidence of deliberate mishandling of classified information by department employees.

One source who spoke with Clinton said that it is “unlikely” that she would throw her hat into the presidential ring for the third time but emphasized that the chances “ain’t zero.”

“But put it this way: It ain’t zero. And does she think about it all the time? Absolutely,” the source said, according to the Post.

Clinton has made no obvious attempts to extinguish the festering 2020 buzz. This month, Trump teased “Crooked Hillary,” suggesting that she enter the race “to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren.” Clinton warned Trump not to “tempt” her to do so on social media.

I think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren. Only one condition. The Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting “C” Subpoena! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2019

She furthered speculation during an interview with PBS NewsHour, claiming that she could “obviously” beat Trump “again,” although her use of “again” remains unclear, as Trump defeated Clinton by surpassing the required 270 Electoral College threshold.

“Maybe there does need to be a rematch. I mean, obviously, I can beat him again,” Clinton said. “But, just seriously, I don’t understand. I don’t think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.”

The former secretary of state continued to fuel the rumblings by posting a quote from Beyoncé about the need to “take” power on Tuesday.

“Beyoncé speaks the truth,” Clinton wrote in the caption:"

You probably think it’s beyond silliness for Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to keep promising FREE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL! NO PREMIUMS! NO CO-PAYS! ILLEGAL ALIENS, TOO! EVERYBODY GETS A PONY!

No one could be gullible enough to fall for that.

I refer you to the economic powerhouse that is Latin America.

Based on hundreds of years of indigenous people voting for politicians who made similar promises, Latin America has become the dream factory that it is today. That’s why Tegucigalpa is practically a byword for “technological innovation,” Santiago was the picture of calm sophistication this weekend, and Caracas is the ultimate in modern conveniences.

Perhaps you missed the article in last Saturday’s New York Times on what socialism has done for the water system in Venezuela:

The brick shack on the outskirts of Venezuela’s capital is crowded with tubs, jugs and buckets. The water they hold must last the family of eight for a week — but it’s not enough for frequent washing or flushing, so the kitchen is filled with greasy pots and the house smells of stale urine. And none of the water is treated, making diarrhea and vomit a regular occurrence. “We practically live in the bathroom,” said the mother of the family … [Her daughter] sat nearby, pale and listless, recovering from her latest bout of diarrhea just one month away from childbirth.

Democrats: We need some of that Latin American magic!

Twenty years ago, 60 percent of Venezuelans had regular access to safe drinking water. Today, only 30 percent do.

How did this happen?

Answer: Poor Venezuelans voted for it. If we let them in, they’ll vote for it here, too. (Except 20 percent, who will be patriotic Americans, i.e. Republicans.)

That’s great news for Sanders and Warren! But it’s terrible news for the country.

Denouncing “squalid oligarchs,” Hugo Chavez promised Venezuela’s poor: “I will not rest until every human being who lives in this land has housing, employment and some way to manage his life.”

The poor were sold! In December 1998, Chavez was elected in a landslide, commemorated with this Seattle Times headline: “VENEZUELAN SLUM DWELLERS VOTE FOR CHANGE.”

As the Miami Herald explained, Chavez “crystallized anger and frustration among Latin America’s poor at free-market policies that have brought only limited prosperity.”

What did free markets and private property ever do for the poor? If they were poor, but others were rich, the “squalid oligarchs” must have stolen from them! (Elizabeth Warren should borrow that epithet. “Wealthy corporations” is getting old.)

Bernie says he “wrote the damn bill” to give Medicare to all, but he was plagiarizing Chavez, who immediately implemented a “single-payer” system for health care in Venezuela. He set up free health clinics, opened military hospitals to the poor, and deployed tens of thousands of government workers to deliver medical services to the barrios.

At Chavez’s invitation, thousands of poor people took up residence in hotels, warehouses and luxurious golf courses. As one of the squatters explained, “We just want a home for our children.” That could be the epitaph of every once-great country: It was for THE CHILDREN!

As you may have heard, this worked out fantastically well. Within a year of Chavez taking office, the economy had shrunk by 7.2 percent and unemployment was at 20 percent. A decade into this socialist paradise, the poor were poorer than ever. There were constant blackouts, food shortages and appalling infant mortality rates. (Much like what we’re seeing in California.)

Venezuela’s infant mortality from diarrhea alone has sextupled in the past 15 years, according to the World Health Organization. (That’s an estimate, on account of Chavez’s quick response to the crisis, which was to stop releasing public health data.)

Potable water, that most basic element of civilization, is virtually nonexistent. Today, sitting on top of the largest oil reserves in the world, Venezuelans are starving.

Chavez didn’t seize power in a military coup. There was no revolution. He wasn’t imposed on Venezuelans by the C.I.A.

He was the people’s choice, elected president in 1998 (with 56 percent of the vote), then re-elected in 2000 (60 percent), then again in 2006 (63 percent) and yet again in 2012 (54 percent). And that’s not counting all the regional, parliamentary, constitutional and referenda elections his party won, over and over and over again.

Like that other Latin American matinee idol, Eva Peron, Chavez destroyed a country by offering the poor pie-in-the-sky promises that were to be paid for by “the rich.” In both cases, it took only about a decade to turn two of the wealthiest countries in the world into two of the most dysfunctional.

In Mexico, the people voted for the Institutional Revolutionary Party for 71 straight years. Total economic failure, year after year. Yes, please, kick me again!

All of this would be of limited interest outside of psychological circles, except for the fact that these voluntary hellholes are adjacent to our country, which is why our southern border is always besieged with desperate Latin Americans.

They’re fleeing the very systems that they voted for, and which (80 percent) would willingly vote for again.

The key point is this: Everywhere in the world, the working class loves socialism — except the U.S.A. To the dismay of American liberals, their movement has always been bereft of the very proletariat that they claim to champion. Instead of truck drivers and longshoremen, Democratic meetings are full of divorcees, transgenders, vegans, and college professors.

Recall that when student radicals tried to organize blue-collar workers in the ’60s, they ended up getting their heads smashed by building trades guys for protesting the war. Today, America’s working class wears a MAGA hat.

That’s why the Democrats are dying to fling open our southern border. As Lenin might have said, you can’t make an omelet without bringing in millions of poverty-stricken Latin Americans."

For the third quarter, “we discovered, and took steps to remediate bugs that primarily affected our legacy Mobile Application Promotion (MAP) product, impacting our ability to target ads and share data with measurement and ad partners,” Twitter said in its letter to shareholders.

“We also experienced greater-than-expected seasonality in our advertising business that began in July and continued into August.”

Twitter said these issues negatively impacted year-over-year revenue growth for the period.

Advertising revenue hit $702 million for the third quarter, which was up from the same period last year, but also failed to match analyst expectations.

Twitter also published fourth-quarter guidance that fell short of expectations. The company is forecasting total revenue to be between $940 million and $1.01 billion for the period, which is below the $1.06 billion that Wall Street is expecting.

In recent weeks, Twitter has found itself in the middle of a Democratic skirmish over whether President Donald Trump should be banned from the platform.

Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) has called on Twitter to give President Trump the boot, claiming that he incites “fear” and that he made comments about the so-called White House “whistleblower.”

But rival candidates Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) have both said President Trump should be allowed to remain on Twitter.

Trump made 40 false claims last Thursday alone, including 30 at his campaign rally in Dallas . Thirty false claims is his highest total for a single rally during the 15 weeks we've been counting at CNN; 40 false claims is his second-highest single day total over those 15 weeks.

Trump's total of 87 false claims was the third-highest for the 15 weeks, though it was down from 129 false claims the week prior.

This was equal-opportunity deception. Trump made 17 false claims about military matters, 17 related to Democrats' impeachment inquiry, 15 about the economy and 12 about trade. He treated a visitor to the White House, Italian President Sergio Mattarella, to 25 false claims in their consecutive joint interactions with the media.

The most egregious false claim: The safety of the Kurds

Trump made it hard to pick a most egregious false claim about Syria and Turkey. Among other things, he claimed that troops he is sending from Syria to elsewhere in the Middle East are coming ""home,"" that the Kurdish PKK is a more severe terror threat than ISIS, and that his narrow, concessionary ceasefire deal with Turkey had been sought by other administrations for 10 years or 15 years.

We think this one was the worst: As Turkey attacked Kurdish areas of northeast Syria, Trump said, ""In the meantime, our soldiers are not in harm's way -- as they shouldn't be -- as two countries fight over land that has nothing to do with us. And the Kurds are much safer right now, but the Kurds know how to fight.""

The Kurds were obviously not at all safer.

The most revealing false claim: Obama and HIV/AIDS

Near the end of his rally speeches, Trump usually repeats a scripted promise about how his administration is going to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the US in 10 years or less.

In Dallas, he attached something new to the pledge: a groundless attack on his predecessor.

""The previous administration spent no money on that,"" he said.

Trump has seemed particularly fixated on former President Barack Obama over the last two weeks, baselessly suggesting there is something nefarious about Obama's post-presidency deal with Netflix and making things up about Obama's dealings with North Korea.

The HIV/AIDS claim was not even close to true. The Obama administration spent billions on anti-HIV/AIDS efforts -- $10.8 billion on domestic HIV/AIDS research between the 2013 fiscal year and 2016 fiscal year alone, according to a review by the Kaiser Family Foundation, plus $85.1 billion more on domestic HIV/AIDS care, housing and prevention programs in those four years, plus $26 billion on global programs over the same period.

The most absurd false claim: The Gloria story

Trump lies for strategic purposes, systematically attempting to reframe reality to his own political advantage. He also just says little incorrect things for no particular reason because he doesn't care to check if they're true.

Welcoming the Stanley Cup champion St. Louis Blues to the White House on October 15, Trump told the fun story about how the 1982 Laura Branigan hit ""Gloria"" became the team's victory song in 2019. He explained, reading from a text, that it all started when the Blues beat the Philadelphia Flyers in January. He added the Flyers ""were hot"" at the time.

The Flyers had lost six consecutive games.

Here is this week's full list of 87, starting with the ones we haven't included in a weekly update before:

The Ukraine scandal and impeachment

Ukraine and ""the server""

""Where is the server? I want to see the server. Let's see what's on the server. So, the server, they say, is held by a company whose primary ownership individual is from Ukraine. I'd like to see the server."" -- October 16 exchange with reporters at meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: Trump appeared to be referring to : Trump appeared to be referring to CrowdStrike , a publicly traded cybersecurity firm that was hired to investigate the hack of DNC servers in 2016. The company was co-founded by Dmitri Alperovitch, an American citizen who was born in Russia , not Ukraine. There is no evidence that any physical DNC server is currently being ""held"" by CrowdStrike.

CrowdStrike -- which, like former special counsel Robert Mueller, attributed the hack to Russia -- said in a previous statement: ""With regards to our investigation of the DNC hack in 2016, we provided all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI. As we've stated before, we stand by our findings and conclusions that have been fully supported by the US Intelligence community.""

Tom Bossert, Trump's former homeland security adviser, said on ABC in September that he was frustrated by the ""conspiracy theory,"" adding: ""It's not only a conspiracy theory. It is completely debunked.""

CrowdStrike has been hired by Republicans as well as Democrats. It has been paid during Trump's presidency by the National Republican Congressional Committee and National Republican Senatorial Committee, public records show.

Schiff's immunity

""I understand he has immunity, but he doesn't have immunity when he puts it on his Twitter, which he did."" -- October 18 teleconference with participants of first all-female spacewalk on International Space Station

Facts First: The constitutional provision that gives Schiff immunity from prosecution over his comments in a congressional committee hearing also gives him immunity over his tweet of a video of those comments, experts say.

As the Congressional Research Service explains , the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause has been interpreted ""to include all 'legislative acts' undertaken by Members or their aides,"" including their committee activities.

""The protection clearly extends to the offending Tweets,"" said William Banks, a law professor at Syracuse University.

Republicans and impeachment

""Republicans are totally deprived of their rights in this Impeachment Witch Hunt. No lawyers, no questions, no transparency!"" -- October 16 tweet

Facts First: As CNN senior congressional correspondent Manu Raju : As CNN senior congressional correspondent Manu Raju noted last week, ""Republicans have been able to ask questions to all the witnesses in the closed-door depositions. Each side alternates and asks questions, and the depositions have lasted roughly 8-10 hours.""

Republicans do not have guaranteed ""rights"" to call or cross-examine witnesses as part of an impeachment process in the House of Representatives. A president who has been impeached cannot be removed from office without a trial in the Senate, but the House does not need to hold anything like a trial before doing the impeaching.

A quote from Jason Chaffetz

""'Because the House has already voted against the Impeachment Proceeding, the current inquiry is totally invalid. The current sham of a so-called investigation is nothing more than an unconstitutional power grab. It needs to end.' @JasonChaffetz @seanhannity Corrupt Adam Schiff"" -- October 18 tweet

Facts First: We give Trump latitude to make minor errors when he is quoting people, but we think it counts as a false claim when he makes changes and omissions that significantly alter the meaning of the quote. In this case, Trump left out an important qualifier from Chaffetz, the former Republican congressman.

Chaffetz actually said the following: ""Because the House has already voted against an impeachment proceeding, the current inquiry is totally invalid unless another formal vote is held."" Trump left out the ""unless another formal vote is held"" -- thus erasing Chaffetz's suggestion that the inquiry could become valid in the future.

The whistleblowers being 'all gone'

""Where is the Whistleblower, or the 2nd Whistleblower, or the 'informant?' All gone because their so-called story didn't come even close to matching up with the exact transcript of the phone call."" -- October 20 tweet

Facts First: There is no evidence that either the first whistleblower (who filed the complaint about Trump's dealings with Ukraine) or the second whistleblower (whose lawyer : There is no evidence that either the first whistleblower (who filed the complaint about Trump's dealings with Ukraine) or the second whistleblower (whose lawyer said they have first-hand information corroborating claims made by the first whistleblower) are now somehow ""gone,"" let alone that they are ""gone"" because of the first whistleblower was shown to be inaccurate.

""The whistleblowers have not vanished,"" Bradley Moss, a colleague of Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the two whistleblowers, said on Twitter.

Paul Ryan and subpoenas

""And the Republicans have been treated very unfairly by the Democrats. I'll say this: Paul Ryan would never issue a subpoena. I don't say right or wrong. He wouldn't do it. He had too much respect for our country."" -- October 16 exchange with reporters at meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: As FactCheck.org : As FactCheck.org noted , numerous Republican subpoenas were issued to the Obama administration during Paul Ryan's tenure as Speaker of the House.

A Fox News poll

""The Fox Impeachment poll has turned out to be incorrect. This was announced on Friday. Despite this, the Corrupt New York Times used this poll in one of its stories, no mention of the correction which they knew about full well! 'Fox News Pollster Braun Research Misrepresented Impeachment Poll: Analysis' @NYPost"" -- October 14 tweet

""Just another FAKE SUPPRESSION POLL, this time from @FoxNews, of course!"" -- October 19 tweet

Facts First: There was no announcement that the : There was no announcement that the poll -- which found 51% support for impeaching and removing Trump -- was ""incorrect."" Trump may have been referring to the New York Post article that criticized the poll, but that is far from the official announcement Trump seemed to be suggesting exists. And there is no evidence that the poll was intentionally designed to suppress Trump's support.

It's also worth noting that the Post, and Trump in quoting the Post, misidentified the pollster. The poll was jointly conducted by Democratic firm Beacon Research and Republican firm Shaw & Company Research. Braun Research was hired to do the fieldwork of contacting the participants; it did not design the poll.

Dana Blanton, Fox News vice president of public opinion research, said in a statement to CNN: ""Our polling unit has long been held in high regard for being a nonpartisan source of research. Under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), the latest FNC poll included interviews with randomly chosen registered voters and -- as is our standard practice -- we reported the partisan distribution we found among the electorate. Braun Research is solely our data collection partner. We stand by our latest poll.""

Turkey and Syria

A quote from Mark Esper

""'The ceasefire is holding up very nicely. There are some minor skirmishes that have ended quickly. New areas being resettled with Kurds. U.S. soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zone. We have secured the Oil.' Mark Esper, Secretary of Defense. Ending endless wars!"" -- October 20 tweet

Facts First: This was the second version of this tweet; the first, which Trump deleted, wrongly referred to Mark Esper as ""Mark Esperanto."" The second version of the tweet, however, was also incorrect: Esper did not say all of the words Trump attributed to him, at least not in public.

Esper had told reporters en route to Afghanistan: ""Well, I think overall the ceasefire generally seems to be holding. We see a stabilization of the lines, if you will, on the ground. And we do get reports of intermittent fires, this and that. It doesn't surprise me necessarily. But that's what we're picking up.""

The transcript shows no Esper comments about oil or Kurds. Idrees Ali, a Reuters reporter traveling with Esper, said there were no such comments.

Trump has a history of misusing or sloppily using quotation marks, repeatedly inserting his own comments into supposed quotes from other people without distinguishing between the two.

The deal with Turkey

""This outcome is something they've been trying to get for 10 years -- everybody -- and they couldn't get it, other administrations. And they never would've been able to get it unless you went somewhat unconventional. I guess I'm an unconventional person."" And: ""We've tried -- we have tried, but everybody has tried to make this deal for 15 years."" And: ""Because the conventional solution is to sit down, negotiate, and they've done that for 15 years. Actually more than that, I understand. And that was never going to work."" -- October 17 exchange with reporters upon Air Force One arrival in Texas

""This is a great day for civilization. I am proud of the United States for sticking by me in following a necessary, but somewhat unconventional, path. People have been trying to make this 'Deal' for many years."" -- October 17 tweet

""...it was unconventional, but they fought for a few days and it was pretty vicious -- the Kurds, who are our friends; Turkey's our friend; but they fought. It was tougher, I mean it was nasty, and you couldn't make a deal for 15, think of it, for 15 years, 20 years, they couldn't make a deal."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

""This is a deal that should have been made 15 years ago, 10 years ago, over the last number of years, under the Obama administration."" -- October 18 exchange with reporters at teleconference with participants of first all-female spacewalk on International Space Station

Facts First: Trump's claims are baseless to the point of being nonsensical. The deal is a narrow agreement specifically tied to the Turkish offensive that followed Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from a Kurdish-held region of northern Syria, not an agreement that resolves longstanding regional disputes. Further, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush never sought to give Turkey anything like the concessionary terms of Trump's deal. In addition, the Syrian civil war had not even started 10 years ago or 15 years ago.

Soldiers being withdrawn from Syria

""We're bringing our soldiers back home, and we've done a great job."" -- October 16 press conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: The soldiers are not being brought ""home,"" at least not yet. Trump : The soldiers are not being brought ""home,"" at least not yet. Trump announced last Monday that ""United States troops coming out of Syria will now redeploy and remain in the region to monitor the situation and prevent a repeat of 2014, when the neglected threat of ISIS raged across Syria and Iraq."" He also announced that 1,800 more troops would be deployed to Saudi Arabia.

Erdogan's comments

Question: ""Are you okay with (Turkish President Recep Tayyip) Erdogan saying that he is not going to do a ceasefire?"" Trump: ""He didn't say that at all. He's meeting. And he's meeting today with some of our representatives."" -- October 16 exchange with reporters at meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: Erdogan had indeed said that: ""'Declare a ceasefire, they say.' We will never declare a ceasefire,"" Erdogan : Erdogan had indeed said that: ""'Declare a ceasefire, they say.' We will never declare a ceasefire,"" Erdogan told reporters on October 15.

The Kurds' safety

""In the meantime, our soldiers are not in harm's way -- as they shouldn't be -- as two countries fight over land that has nothing to do with us. And the Kurds are much safer right now, but the Kurds know how to fight."" -- October 16 exchange with reporters at meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: It is clearly not true that the Kurds were safer ""right now"" -- after US troops vacated their positions in northern Syria, after Turkey began its bombardment and before a ceasefire was announced -- than they had been before. More than 160,000 Kurds were : It is clearly not true that the Kurds were safer ""right now"" -- after US troops vacated their positions in northern Syria, after Turkey began its bombardment and before a ceasefire was announced -- than they had been before. More than 160,000 Kurds were displaced by the Turkish offensive, according to the United Nations.

The Kurdish Red Crescent said in a Monday statement: ""Since the ceasefire, we documented 21 civilians dead and 27 injured."" The Red Crescent said the total would rise.

The PKK and ISIS

""Now, the PKK, which is a part of the Kurds, as you know, is probably worse at terror and more of terrorist threat, in many ways, than ISIS."" -- October 16 press conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: Though the US government does consider the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) a terrorist entity, the government and independent experts consider ISIS as a much more dangerous and much more global threat. ISIS has also undertaken many more attacks.

""The PKK is a domestic Turkish terrorist organization that's focused exclusively on its struggle for Kurdish independence from Turkey,"" said Bryan Gibson, an expert on Kurdistan and assistant professor of history at Hawaii Pacific University. ""It has never posed a threat to the US nor has it specifically targeted Americans...ISIS is a global terrorist organization, which has specifically targeted Americans in terrorist attacks, fought a war with the US, and continues to pose a clear and present danger to Americans at home and abroad.""

As The New York Times reported , a database of terror attacks maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland counts 2,455 PKK attacks since the organization was founded in 1978 -- versus 6,451 attacks by the Islamic State ""since it became formally known by its name in 2013."" In 2018, the consortium counted 122 attacks and 136 deaths from the PKK versus 735 attacks and 2,221 deaths from ISIS.

The Times also noted: ""The State Department's latest annual terrorism report contains over 500 references (to) ISIS, including a lengthy introduction assessing its influence in the region, compared with under 30 mentions of the PKK.""

Hurricane Harvey

Relief money for Texas

Touting the ""billions and billions of dollars"" in relief money he authorized for Texas in the wake of Hurricane Harvey in 2017 -- and teasing Texas lawmakers over their requests for him to spend more -- Trump said, ""You made a fortune on the hurricane."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: Texas did not make money from Hurricane Harvey.

Harvey created costs of $125 billion, the federal government estimates. As of Wednesday, the government says Texas has been allocated $26.6 billion in federal disaster funds since 2017.

The Texas Department of Insurance estimated in April that personal and commercial insurance payouts related to Harvey would total $19.6 billion.

Aside from the personal toll of the disaster, which killed dozens of people, thousands of Texas residents have suffered severe financial losses from which they have not recovered.

Coast Guard rescues

Trump said of Hurricane Harvey: ""Our Coast Guard saved 16,000 lives."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: The Coast Guard : The Coast Guard says the correct number is 11,022 people rescued.

Democrats

The Bidens

Trump conflated his accusations against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter -- railing against Hunter Biden's business dealings, then saying that Joe Biden ""takes a billion-five"" from China and ""he goes on and he allows China to rip us off."" He added, ""So the Bidens got rich while America got robbed."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: There is no evidence Joe Biden has received large sums of money from China or has otherwise gained wealth as a result of his son's business dealings abroad.

Trump has previously made the ""billion-five"" accusation against Hunter Biden. While a conservative author has used this figure, it has not been proven. A lawyer for Hunter Biden, George Mesires, says the investment company in which Hunter Biden has an equity stake was capitalized with a total of about $4.2 million at today's exchange rates, ""not $1.5 billion."" Even this investment was not a direct payment to Hunter Biden; He holds a 10% stake in the firm, Mesires says , and has not made a profit to date.

Obama and AIDS

""We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America in less than 10 years -- we're doing that. Who would have believed we could do that? We're doing that. And the previous administration spent no money on that..."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: The Obama administration spent $10.8 billion on domestic HIV/AIDS research between the 2013 fiscal year and 2016 fiscal year alone, according to a : The Obama administration spent $10.8 billion on domestic HIV/AIDS research between the 2013 fiscal year and 2016 fiscal year alone, according to a review by the Kaiser Family Foundation, and $85.1 billion more on domestic HIV/AIDS care, housing and prevention programs in those four years. It also spent $26 billion on international HIV/AIDS initiatives of various kinds over the same time period.

Democrats and undocumented immigrants

Trump noted that all of the 10 Democratic presidential candidates at a debate in June raised their hand to say they would extend health care coverage to undocumented immigrants, then claimed that the Democrats ""want to give more to illegal aliens than they give to American citizens."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: The Democrats want to give these immigrants the same access to care that citizens have, not more.

Dallas crowds

The crowd outside his Dallas rally

""...outside, they have close to 30,000 people. And I wonder if I could ask the fire marshal, fill up this little area, let 'em in."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: Trump's estimate was way off. ""We didn't have 30K outside. Probably had upward of 5K outside,"" Dallas Police Department spokesman Sgt. Mitchell Warren told CNN in an email.

The crowd inside the Dallas rally

""And by the way, I have to say this. So outside, they have close to 30,000 people, and I wonder if I could ask the fire marshal: fill up this little area, let 'em in. You know, they have a certain max. We broke the record tonight."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: Trump did not break the attendance record at the American Airlines Center. Jason Evans, a spokesman for the Dallas Fire-Rescue Department, told CNN that the fire department and the arena calculated an attendance of 18,500. The Dallas Mavericks, who play in the arena, had an average announced attendance of 20,013 per game last season, among the highest in the NBA, according to ESPN : Trump did not break the attendance record at the American Airlines Center. Jason Evans, a spokesman for the Dallas Fire-Rescue Department, told CNN that the fire department and the arena calculated an attendance of 18,500. The Dallas Mavericks, who play in the arena, had an average announced attendance of 20,013 per game last season, among the highest in the NBA, according to ESPN data

Economy, trade and international affairs

Iran's economy

""I think we're in a very good position in the Middle East. I think we're very, very strong in the Middle East. Iran is going to hell; their economy is in deep trouble. Their GDP went down 20%, which nobody ever even heard of before. Probably 25%."" -- October 16 exchange with reporters at meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. While Iran's economy is shrinking, the Statistical Center of Iran : Trump was exaggerating. While Iran's economy is shrinking, the Statistical Center of Iran reported that the country's GDP fell by 4.9% in the year 2018-2019.

Experts say there is no apparent basis for Trump's ""20%"" and ""25%"" figures even though Iran's official economic data is less reliable than official data in the US.

""It's still not iron-clad stuff, but if the situation was anywhere near 25% decline then the official stats would at least be in the teens. This is also why folks cross-check these numbers with independent and global institutional data (such as IMF's). My suspicion is that it's closer to 13-15% decrease, which still puts it a good 10% points below Trump's claim,"" Hussein Banai, an assistant professor who studies Iran at Indiana University's School of International Studies, said in an email.

The International Monetary Fund expects a 9.5% contraction in Iran's economy this year -- down from an earlier estimate of a 6% contraction, but still not 20% or 25%. The World Bank forecasts an 8.7% contraction in the 2019-2020 period.

Stock market participation

""If you look at people's stocks, their 401(k)s, if you look at anything you want to look at, they're far better off now than they probably ever have been in this country. Record stock markets. And don't forget, stock market is not just rich people. It's all people. Because all people own in the stock markets."" -- October 16 exchange with reporters at meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: Trump was right that it's not only rich people who own stocks, but it's not true that ""all"" people own stocks. Roughly : Trump was right that it's not only rich people who own stocks, but it's not true that ""all"" people own stocks. Roughly half of Americans owned stocks as of 2017, according to academic studies and polls.

Wealthy people own a disproportionate share of stocks. A 2017 paper by New York University economist Edward Wolff found that the top 10% of households owned 84% of stocks in 2016.

The Soviet Union's 'downsizing'

""You know, Russia was involved in Afghanistan. It used to be called the Soviet Union -- now it's called Russia for a reason. Because they lost so much money in Afghanistan that they had to downsize. A very big downsizing."" -- October 16 exchange with reporters at meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: This was an exaggeration. Experts say the Soviet Union's failed war in Afghanistan was far from the only reason for its collapse, though it did contribute to it. (We'll ignore Trump's use of the term ""downsizing"" to describe the dissolution of the Soviet Union.)

Louis Vuitton

""And they're opening up a plant in Texas. The first time, I believe -- one of the great companies of the world -- first time ever in the United States."" -- October 17 exchange with reporters upon Air Force One arrival in Texas

Facts First: The Louis Vuitton workshop Trump visited in Texas is the company's third workshop in the United States. It also has : The Louis Vuitton workshop Trump visited in Texas is the company's third workshop in the United States. It also has two in California.

US tariff history

Trump boasted about a World Trade Organization decision to allow the US to impose $7.5 billion in tariffs on European countries in response to their subsidies to airplane manufacturer Airbus.

""We're winning, in the case of the European Union, $7.5 billion. And Italy has a percentage of that to pay. And, in the -- in other cases, we've won. And we have a lot of money coming into the United States for the first time ever. Tremendous amounts of money in many different forms, including tariffs."" -- October 16 exchange with reporters at meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: This is nonsensical. This is clearly not the first time the US has had tariff revenue; the US generated $32 billion from tariffs in 2016, the last full year before Trump's presidency, according to the : This is nonsensical. This is clearly not the first time the US has had tariff revenue; the US generated $32 billion from tariffs in 2016, the last full year before Trump's presidency, according to the Congressional Research Service , and $41.6 billion in the 2018 fiscal year, according to Customs and Border Protection

Trump was wrong even if he was talking specifically about tariffs authorized by the WTO. ""Airbus is not the only case where 'retaliation' was authorized and US tariffs went into effect,"" said Dan Ikenson, director of the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. Ikenson pointed to the case of hormone-treated beef, in which the WTO approved retaliatory tariffs the US imposed in 1999.

Trade deficits

""And we lose, for many years, $500 billion a year with China and many other countries, we lose billions. We lose with everybody -- but that's all changing now."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: ""We lose with everybody"" is an exaggeration, even going by Trump's disputed characterization of trade deficits as ""losses."" While the US did have an : ""We lose with everybody"" is an exaggeration, even going by Trump's disputed characterization of trade deficits as ""losses."" While the US did have an overall trade deficit with the world in 2018, it had surpluses with multiple countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, Canada and Singapore, according to US government data.

We explain in a separate item that the US has never had a $500 billion trade deficit with China.

The media and the G7

""So interesting that, when I announced Trump National Doral in Miami would be used for the hosting of the G-7, and then rescinded due to Do Nothing Democrat/Fake News Anger, very few in Media mentioned that NO PROFITS would be taken, or would be given FREE, if legally permissible!"" -- October 20 tweet

""I thought I was doing something very good for our Country by using Trump National Doral, in Miami, for hosting the G-7 Leaders...I announced that I would be willing to do it at NO PROFIT or, if legally permissible, at ZERO COST to the USA. But, as usual, the Hostile Media & their Democrat Partners went CRAZY!"" -- October 19 tweet

Facts First: Numerous news outlets reported the White House's claim that Trump would not make a profit on a G7 summit held at his resort. (CNN's article, for example, : Numerous news outlets reported the White House's claim that Trump would not make a profit on a G7 summit held at his resort. (CNN's article, for example, quoted acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney as saying, ""Trump will not be profiting in 'any way, shape or form'""; the New York Times article said , ""Mr. Mulvaney said the hotel would put on the summit 'at cost.' 'I think the president has pretty much made it very clear since he got here that he doesn't profit from being here,' he said. 'He has no interest in profit from being here.'"")

News outlets did not report that anything would be ""given FREE"" because Mulvaney and White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham used the phrase "" at cost ,"" not ""free"" or ""zero cost.""

The 2016 election

Facebook and the election

""And I'm no fan of those companies. They were against me. Somebody said I lost maybe two million votes, maybe more, because of Facebook."" -- October 16 press conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: Trump appeared to be referring to a flawed study that dubiously alleged that Google bias was sufficiently bad to have shifted at least 2.6 million votes away from Trump in the 2016 presidential election. While the author, Robert Epstein, did criticize Facebook in congressional testimony in July, he did not find that Facebook cost Trump 2 million votes. You can read a longer fact check about this study : Trump appeared to be referring to a flawed study that dubiously alleged that Google bias was sufficiently bad to have shifted at least 2.6 million votes away from Trump in the 2016 presidential election. While the author, Robert Epstein, did criticize Facebook in congressional testimony in July, he did not find that Facebook cost Trump 2 million votes. You can read a longer fact check about this study here

Trump was vague, saying that ""somebody"" said he had lost 2 million votes or more, so it is possible he was referring to something else. Regardless, there is no evidence for the claim that he lost millions of votes because of some nefarious acts by social media companies.

The number of Republican candidates

""I never debated, my whole life has been a debate, but I never debated like with a podium and this and that. So, I said who are they? And we had 17 people plus me. We had 18, it was actually not 17, it was 18, remember? Gilmore, nobody remembers him but we had 18 people."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: There were : There were 17 candidates in the early Republican primary debates in 2015, including Jim Gilmore, the former Virginia governor.

We usually ignore it when Trump says there were 18, since he was off by only one, but we're flagging it here because Trump specifically rejected the accurate number, 17.

'Corruption'

Trump recited his usual complaints about how he was treated by US intelligence officials involved in investigating his campaign's relationship with Russia. He added: ""There was a lot of corruption. Maybe it goes right up to President Obama. I happen to think it does."" -- October 16 press conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: There is simply no evidence of Obama corruption.

Women in space

""Joining us during their spacewalk outside the International Space Station -- and this is the first time for a woman outside of the Space Station -- are Flight Engineers Christina Koch and Flight Engineer Jessica Meir."" -- October 18 teleconference with participants of first all-female spacewalk on International Space Station

Facts First: Trump was immediately fact checked by Meir, who noted that this is not ""the first time for a woman outside of the Space Station.""

Meir said: ""Thank you. First -- first of all, we don't want to take too much credit, because there have been many other female spacewalkers before us. This is just the first time that there have been two women outside at the same time.""

The Internal Revenue Service

""I will never allow the IRS to be used as a political weapon -- except in the case of myself, where they use it against me."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: There is no basis for Trump's claim that he is allowing the IRS to be used against himself. The IRS is run by a Trump appointee, Charles Rettig, and there is no evidence it is being used against Trump; Democrats are seeking access to his tax returns, but that is not the same thing.

The St. Louis Blues and Philadelphia Flyers

""But they (the Blues) gathered at a bar in Philadelphia where they heard the 1982 hit, 'Gloria.' That's where you were -- that's why we were playing that song, for those of you that don't know what's happened here. 'Gloria.' The next day, you shut out the Flyers, who were hot, and 'Gloria' became your new 'win song.'"" -- October 15 speech at ceremony for Stanley Cup champions St. Louis Blues

Facts First: We realize this sounds silly, but since we count each and every Trump false claim no matter how little, we must note that he was the opposite of correct when he said the Flyers were ""hot"" at the time the Blues faced them on January 7. The Flyers were on a : We realize this sounds silly, but since we count each and every Trump false claim no matter how little, we must note that he was the opposite of correct when he said the Flyers were ""hot"" at the time the Blues faced them on January 7. The Flyers were on a six-game losing streak

Here are the claims Trump made last week that we have previously fact checked in one of these weekly roundups:

The Ukraine scandal

The accuracy of the whistleblower

Trump claimed six times last week, in tweets and public remarks, that the whistleblower's account of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was highly inaccurate -- calling the whistleblower's claims ""sooo wrong, not even close,"" ""so far from the facts,"" and ""totally different from the actual transcribed call.""

Facts First: The whistleblower's account of the call has largely been proven accurate. In fact, the rough transcript released by Trump himself showed that the whistleblower's three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct.

The timeline of Schiff's comments

""So he (Adam Schiff) made up a totally false conversation with the Ukrainian President, and we caught him cold. Everybody knew it anyway. See? We did one thing -- you always have to do the unexpected. They never thought I'd release the conversation with the Ukrainian President."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: Schiff delivered his : Schiff delivered his rendition of Trump's call the day after Trump released the transcript, not before. Trump initially recounted the timeline correctly, then adopted this incorrect timeline.

The legality of Schiff's comments

""Hope all House Republicans, and honest House Democrats, will vote to CENSURE Rep. Adam Schiff tomorrow for his brazen and unlawful act of fabricating (making up) a totally phony conversation with the Ukraine President and U.S. President, me. Most have never seen such a thing!"" -- October 16 tweet

Facts First: While it's fair for Trump to be miffed about Schiff's comments -- Schiff's mix of near-quotes from Trump, his own analysis, and supposed ""parody"" was at the very least confusing -- Schiff's words were not illegal.

Again, the Constitution includes a specific provision that allows members of Congress to speak freely during official meetings.

The rough transcript

Trump twice claimed that he had released an ""exact"" transcript of his call with Zelensky.

Facts First: The document released by the White House explicitly : The document released by the White House explicitly says , on the first page, that it is not an exact transcript of the call.

""A Memorandum of a Telephone Conversation (TELCON) is not a verbatim transcript of a discussion. The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place. A number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record, including poor telecommunications connections and variations in accent and/or interpretation,"" the document says.

Immigration

Democrats and the wall

""Democrats always liked Walls, until I built them. Do you see what's happening here?"" -- October 17 tweet

""And you know five years ago, almost every one of them (Democrats) wanted a wall."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: Democrats did support Republican demands for fencing in the comprehensive immigration reform bill six years ago, but that was fencing -- and Democrats agreed to endorse it only in exchange for Republican support for their own preferred policies, like a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

The wall

""...the WALL is being built!"" -- October 14 tweet

""We're building a great wall along the southern border and it's going up rapidly."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: As of September 30, no additional miles of border wall had been built during Trump's presidency in places where barriers had not existed before, according to a fact sheet from Customs and Border Protection. Over Trump's tenure in office, 69 miles of barriers had been constructed in places where ""dilapidated and outdated"" barriers had existed before; that's a pace of about half a mile of replacement barrier per week.

Trump said three times that the Democrats support ""open borders.""

Democrats and borders

Facts First: Even 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests.

Mexican troops

""Mexico, today, had 27,000 soldiers on our border and we've stopped this horrible migration of people..."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: Mexico has deployed a substantial number of troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular. Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan told reporters in September that 10,000 of the approximately 25,000 Mexican troops deployed were on Mexico's own southern border: ""They've created a new national guard within their country: 10,000 troops to the southern border; 15,000 troops to the northern border with the United States,"" he : Mexico has deployed a substantial number of troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular. Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan told reporters in September that 10,000 of the approximately 25,000 Mexican troops deployed were on Mexico's own southern border: ""They've created a new national guard within their country: 10,000 troops to the southern border; 15,000 troops to the northern border with the United States,"" he said

Trade and China

The World Trade Organization

""I think the WTO award has been testament to a lot of good work by the Trump administration. We never won with the WTO, or essentially never won. Very seldom did we win. And now we're winning a lot. We're winning a lot because they know if we're not treated fairly, we're leaving."" And: ""But the WTO -- that's the World Trade Organization -- has been very unfair to the United States. They know I feel that way, and I think since they know I feel that way, all of a sudden, we're starting to win very big awards."" -- October 16 exchange with reporters at meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

""We didn't win any cases at the WTO...And we won a lot of cases lately, we didn't win anything for years, practically."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: The US has long won cases at the World Trade Organization, and there is no evidence that WTO adjudicators have suddenly changed their behavior toward the US. While Trump's administration took over the 15-year-old Airbus case in 2017, the latest US victory in that case in particular was only the most recent in a series of wins that dates : The US has long won cases at the World Trade Organization, and there is no evidence that WTO adjudicators have suddenly changed their behavior toward the US. While Trump's administration took over the 15-year-old Airbus case in 2017, the latest US victory in that case in particular was only the most recent in a series of wins that dates back to the early Obama administration.

Contrary to Trump's repeated assertion, the US has long been successful in WTO disputes -- his own Council of Economic Advisers said in a report in February 2018 that the US had won 86% of the cases it has brought since 1995. The global average was 84% and China's figure 67%, according to the council.

As is standard for the WTO, the US has tended to lose cases where it is defending the case rather than bringing it -- but even in those cases, Trump's advisers noted that the US did better (a 25% victory rate) than the world average (17%) or China's rate (just 5%).

A Bloomberg Law review in March found that the US success rate in cases it brings to the WTO had increased very slightly since Trump took office, from 84.8% in 2016 to 85.4%.

China's economic history

""And China became rich because of the WTO. That's when China really ascended. That's when China went up. That's when they made their great rise. They were flatlining, and then, all of a sudden, around the year 2000, 2001, when they got involved with the WTO, it became a whole different story."" -- October 16 exchange with reporters at meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: China's economy was not ""flatlining"" before it became a member of the World Trade Organization in late 2001. China had experienced significant growth for years prior.

According to World Bank figures , China grew by 7.7% in 1999, 8.5% in 2000 and 8.3% in 2001. It then grew by 9.1% in 2002, 10.0% in 2003 and 10.1% in 2004. Its post-WTO growth peaked at 14.2% in 2007 -- almost identical to its growth in 1992.

Nicholas Lardy of the Peterson Institute for International Economics wrote in 2008: ""China has been the fastest growing economy in the world over almost three decades, expanding at 10 per cent per year in real terms."" In an email to CNN in July, when Trump made another version of this comment, Lardy said, ""Uninformed would be the best characterization of the President's comment.""

China's economic performance

""They've (China) had the worst year they've had in 27 years and we're having the best year we've ever had, so that's good, that's good."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

""And they're having the worst year they've had in 57 years."" -- October 18 exchange with reporters at teleconference with participants of first all-female spacewalk on International Space Station

Facts First: The US is not having its best economic year ever by the metric by which China is having its worst year in 27 years.

China's second-quarter GDP growth of 6.2% and third-quarter GDP growth of 6% were its worst since 1992, 27 years ago . US second-quarter growth was 2%, lower than in the same quarter of 2018 and 2017.

Who is paying the tariffs

""We've taken in tens of billions of dollars of tariffs and China's eating the cost, because they devalued their currency..."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: A bevy of : A bevy of economic studies has found that Americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs, and Americans make the actual tariff payments.

China's agricultural spending

""So I hear the most the farmers ever did (in business with China) was $16 billion, so I said, 'Ask for 70.' They said, 'No, you don't mean 70. Sixteen.' 'Ask for 70.'"" -- October 15 speech at ceremony for Stanley Cup champions St. Louis Blues

""The most they ever did was $20 billion of product from our farmers, our great farmers, our patriot farmers."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: China spent $25.9 billion on American agricultural products in 2012, according to figures from the Department of Agriculture.

The trade deficit with China

Trump said twice that the US has a $500 billion trade deficit with China.

Facts First: Through 2018, there has never been a $500 billion trade deficit with China. The 2018 deficit was : Through 2018, there has never been a $500 billion trade deficit with China. The 2018 deficit was $381 billion last year when counting goods and services, $420 billion when counting goods alone.

The trade deficit with the European Union

""They do very well with us on trade. They had a trade surplus with the United States, over the last five or six years, of about $150 billion a year."" He added that the US deficit ""could even be"" $178 billion. -- October 16 press conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: The trade : The trade deficit with the European Union was $114.6 billion in 2018, $101.2 billion in 2017 and $92.5 billion in 2016.

The deficit was $169.6 billion in 2018 if you only count trade in goods and ignore trade in services. But Trump, as usual, failed to specify that he was using this more limited measure.

Military affairs

Military spending

""Our military has been completely rebuilt...We spent two and a half trillion dollars rebuilding it over the last three years."" -- October 16 exchange with reporters at meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

""We've invested more than $2.5 trillion restoring our armed forces..."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: Defense spending for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 was $2.05 trillion, and that includes more than three-and-a-half months of Obama's tenure, since the 2017 fiscal year began in October 2016.

Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he thinks Trump must have been including military funding for the 2020 fiscal year to get to the ""$2.5 trillion"" figure -- but the 2020 fiscal year has just started, and Harrison noted that the defense appropriation has not yet been approved by Congress.

The nuclear arsenal

""Our nuclear has been totally updated and in some cases new."" -- October 16 press conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: Experts say that Trump has not yet implemented significant changes to the US nuclear arsenal. ""I am not aware that Trump can claim to have done anything for the state of the nuclear arsenal -- but nothing urgent needed to be done anyway,"" said Scott Kemp, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Nuclear Security and Policy, who served as a State Department adviser on arms control early in the Obama administration.

NATO contributions

""And I want to just thank Secretary General Stoltenberg because he is going around saying that President Trump was able to raise over $100 billion last year, which is true."" -- October 16 press conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

Facts First: This is at least a slight exaggeration -- and one Stoltenberg gently tried to correct when he met with Trump in April. Though Stoltenberg has indeed given Trump credit for pressuring NATO countries into boosting spending, he has said, to Trump and in other forums, that the extra $100 billion the countries will spend on their own militaries will come by the : This is at least a slight exaggeration -- and one Stoltenberg gently tried to correct when he met with Trump in April. Though Stoltenberg has indeed given Trump credit for pressuring NATO countries into boosting spending, he has said, to Trump and in other forums, that the extra $100 billion the countries will spend on their own militaries will come by the end of 2020 , not that it happened ""last year.""

Veterans Choice

""We passed for the veterans VA Choice and VA Accountability on behalf of those great people. They've been trying to pass it from us 50 years, they couldn't get it done. But those guys right there and me, we got it done."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: Obama : Obama signed the Choice program into law in 2014. Trump signed a law in 2018, the VA MISSION Act, to expand and change the program.

A timeline for Syria

""But we were supposed to be there for 30 days; we stayed for 10 years."" -- October 16 exchange with reporters at meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

""We were supposed to be in Syria for one month. That was 10 years ago."" -- October 16 press conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella

""And, by the way, we have the strongest military in the world. But we've been there for 10 years."" -- October 17 exchange with reporters upon Air Force One arrival in Texas

Facts First: There was never any specific timeline for the US military's involvement in Syria, much less a timeline of a mere 30 days. The US began bombing Syria in 2014 and deployed ground troops : There was never any specific timeline for the US military's involvement in Syria, much less a timeline of a mere 30 days. The US began bombing Syria in 2014 and deployed ground troops in 2015 -- five years ago and four years ago, not 10 years ago.

""There was never a 30-day timetable on the US presence in Syria,"" said Syria expert Steven Heydemann, a professor of government and director of the Middle East Studies program at Smith College. ""The previous administration, and officials serving in this administration, have never offered a fixed timetable for the US mission. Official statements have emphasized that the presence of US forces would be short, limited in scope, and small. But beyond general comments along those lines, there has been no statement indicating it would end after 30 days.""

News outlets including The New York Times reported in mid-2012 that a small number of CIA officers were on the ground in Turkey to help policymakers decide how to arm the opposition to Syria's government, so you can make a reasonable argument that US involvement goes back more than seven years. Still, ""10 years ago"" remains an exaggeration.

Accomplishments, promises and popualrity

Approval with Republicans

""95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you!"" -- October 16 tweet

""95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party!"" -- October 17 tweet

Facts First: Trump's approval rating among Republicans is very high, regularly in the 80s and sometimes creeping into the 90s, but it has not been 95% in any recent major poll we could find.

Trump was at 88% with Republicans in a Quinnipiac University poll conducted from October 11-13, 84% in an Ipsos/Reuters poll conducted October 14-15, and 87% in Gallup data gathered from October 1 to 13.

Pre-existing conditions

""We will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: We usually don't fact-check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward : We usually don't fact-check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump is currently supporting a Republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of Obamacare void. He has not issued a plan to reinstate the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions if the suit succeeds.

The unemployment rate

""Last month, unemployment reached its lowest level in 51 years."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: The September : The September rate , 3.5%, was the lowest since December 1969, just under 50 years ago.

Ivanka Trump and jobs

""Even though they're related to me, just slightly, I will tell you, what a job. Ivanka is responsible for 14 million jobs this year, over the last couple of years, with companies going out and training people. And it's been an incredible success. She started off two and a half years ago; she wanted 500,000 jobs. That's a lot. But it was typical Ivanka. It ended up -- and now, the number, I think it just crossed 14 million jobs going to Walmart, going to ExxonMobil, going to the great companies. And they train people. And the numbers are incredible, and that's one of the reasons that our numbers are so good."" -- October 17 speech at opening of Louis Vuitton workshop in Alvarado, Texas

Facts First: Given that fewer than 6.5 million jobs had been created during the entire Trump presidency through September, Ivanka Trump, the President's daughter and White House adviser, is obviously not ""responsible for 14 million jobs this year."" The President was referring to the Pledge to America's Workers, an initiative for which companies had : Given that fewer than 6.5 million jobs had been created during the entire Trump presidency through September, Ivanka Trump, the President's daughter and White House adviser, is obviously not ""responsible for 14 million jobs this year."" The President was referring to the Pledge to America's Workers, an initiative for which companies had promised to create 14.3 million ""new opportunities"" for workers as of Tuesday -- but many of these ""opportunities"" are internal training opportunities, not new jobs.

The web page for the pledge program describes them as ""education and training opportunities."" Also, as CNN has previously reported , many of the companies had already planned these opportunities before Ivanka Trump launched the initiative.

Energy production

""We've ended the war on American energy. America is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world..."" -- October 17 speech at opening of Louis Vuitton workshop in Alvarado, Texas

Trump claimed to have ended ""the war on a thing called American energy,"" then boasted that the US is ""now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world."" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: The US has not just ""now"" become the world's top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump's policies: it took the top spot : The US has not just ""now"" become the world's top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump's policies: it took the top spot in 2012 , under the very president he has accused of perpetuating the ""war."" The US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump's tenure.

The judiciary

Obama and judicial vacancies

""So I got in and say, 'How many federal judges do I have?' 'Sir, you have 142 two federal judges.' 'No, you don't understand the question. That's impossible. That would mean that President Obama didn't appoint 142 judges.'...And then they say, 'Obama, wasn't he such a wonderful president?' How are you a wonderful president -- how are you a wonderful president when the most important thing you can do you handed over to the Republicans, 142?"" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: Trump exaggerated. There were 104 vacancies on January 1, 2017, just before Trump was inaugurated, according to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments.

The history of judicial vacancies

""You know, when I got into office, they say the most important thing a president can do, I actually think it's defense, but they say is the appointment of federal judges. So when I got in -- always when you get in, there are none. How many do you have? 'I have none, none.'"" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas

Facts First: It's not true that presidents are usually left no judicial vacancies at all. According to Wheeler, there were 53 vacancies on January 1, 2009, just before Obama took office; 80 vacancies on January 1, 2001, just before George W. Bush took office; 107 vacancies on January 1, 1993, just before Bill Clinton took office.

So Trump had the most judges to appoint since Clinton, but, clearly, other presidents also had appointing to do.

Wind energy

Trump told his usual semi-comedic story about how, if ""windmills"" are used for energy as he said Democrats want, people's televisions will go out if the wind is not presently blowing: ""Windmills, you know? 'Darling, I want to watch Trump speak tonight. We can't, darling, the wind isn't blowing.'"" -- October 17 campaign rally in Dallas"
795,Haris Alic,"The debate, which is being sponsored by The Washington Post and MSNBC in Georgia on Nov. 20, will be moderated by NBC News’s Andrea Mitchel and Kristen Welker, The Washington Post’s Ashley Parker, and MSNBC host Rachel Maddow.
As the Postreported when announ… [+2389 chars]",The Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced that its upcoming presidential primary debate will be moderated by an an all-female panel amid concerns over the event's neutrality and sinking viewership.,2019-10-24,Breitbart News,DNC Announces All-Female Moderator Panel for Next Debate amid Neutrality Concerns and Sinking Viewership,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/23/dnc-announces-all-female-moderator-panel-for-next-debate-amid-neutrality-concerns-and-sinking-viewership/,"The Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced that its upcoming presidential primary debate will be moderated by an an all-female panel amid concerns over the event’s neutrality and sinking viewership.

The debate, which is being sponsored by The Washington Post and MSNBC in Georgia on Nov. 20, will be moderated by NBC News’s Andrea Mitchel and Kristen Welker, The Washington Post’s Ashley Parker, and MSNBC host Rachel Maddow.

As the Post reported when announcing the lineup, the November debate will mark the second time in history that an all-female panel has moderated such an event. It is unclear, however, if the gender of the moderators will be enough to allay doubts and concerns about the neutrality of the DNC and the NBC networks.

Even prior to the moderator lineup, progressive activists had questioned if it is improper for MSNBC to sponsor the event given that executives of its parent corporation, Comcast Corp., have donated heavily to candidates likely to be on the debate stage. In particular, Comcast executives have overwhelmingly showered two of the more moderate Democrats running, former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, with campaign donations. Executives have donated more than $77,000 to Buttigieg and nearly $75,000 to Biden since the start of the 2020 cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

No such donations were made to the presidential campaigns of Sens. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) or Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who poll higher than Buttigieg nationally and outpace Biden in several of the early primary states.

Apart from the potential bias on the part of MSNBC and Comcast, progressive activists and even lower-tiered presidential candidates have questioned the DNC qualifications standards for the debate. Since the DNC first announced it would be limiting participation in the debates, the organization has consistently tightened requirements in hopes of winnowing the field. The tactic, though, has only led to accusations that the DNC is “penalizing” lesser known candidates to the benefit of those that are more established, like Biden.

For the upcoming debate, the DNC is requiring candidates reach at least three percent in four state or national polls or five percent in two state polls. For those unable to meet that goal in the 19-person field, candidates can also qualify by receiving 165,000 “unique donations,” from at least 600 “unique donors” in 20 states.

To date, only eight candidate have met these qualification standards for the November debate.

Complicating matters for the DNC is that viewership for its last four presidential primary debates has fallen off significantly. October’s debate, which was hosted by CNN in Ohio, only drew an estimated 8.3 million views, much lower than the 9.7 million that tuned in for the second primary debate in July."

797,John Carney,"If the circumstances present itself to where we have to wipe out the shareholders, we will, Federal Housing Finance Agency director Mark Calabria said during a hearing before the House Financial Service Committee Tuesday.
Shares fell immediately following th… [+8367 chars]",Fannie and Freddie investors assumed that the end of conservatorship would result in a windfall. That might be a costly error. | Economy,2019-10-23,Breitbart News,Carney: Why Fannie and Freddie Shareholders May Get Wiped Out in a Recap,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2019/10/23/carney-why-fannie-and-freddie-shareholders-may-get-wiped-out-in-a-recap/,"Shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac crashed on Wednesday after their regulator said the Trump administration stood willing to wipe out shareholders if needed to put the company back into private hands.

“If the circumstances present itself to where we have to wipe out the shareholders, we will,” Federal Housing Finance Agency director Mark Calabria said during a hearing before the House Financial Service Committee Tuesday.

Shares fell immediately following the comments. On Wednesday, Fannie shares fell by 9.2 percent and Freddie shares fell by 9.3 percent. Compared with its recent high in September, Fannie shares are down 27 percent.

Calabria’s comments caught many shareholders off-guard because he has long been looked at as an ally, chiefly because he has said he wants to return the companies to private control and co-authored a white paper arguing that their long stay in conservatorship is not in keeping with the 2008 law that empowered the FHFA to take them over.

The Trump administration has broken with the Obama administration’s policy, and the proposals of many lawmakers over several years, that assumed the companies would eventually be wound down, phased out, replaced by new market mechanics or private-public partnerships, or broken up. Even before President Donald Trump took office, then-Treasury Secretary-to-be Steven Mnuchin said that privatizing Fannie and Freddie was a top administration priority.

That was a welcome change to shareholders, many of whom had purchased shares of the companies in the belief that eventually they would return to private control. Many investors, including some famous fund managers, have battled the government for years seeking to pry their profits from the hands of the U.S. Treasury. These efforts have largely met with failure in federal courts, although a federal appeals court based in New Orleans recently dealt them a significant victory.

Calabria expressing a willingness to “wipe out” existing shareholders has shaken the newfound confidence that had seen shares quadruple in value this year.

That confidence looks misplaced. The FHFA said last year the two companies would need to around $180 billion of combined capital to be considered well-capitalized, although the agency has yet to finalize the capital requirements. Currently, Fannie has $6.4 billion in capital and Freddie has $4.8 billion. That leaves a $167 billion capital gap, nearly seven times their combined income last year.

The Trump administration has said it is exploring the possibility of closing that capital gap by going to public securities markets. But it is unclear how much capital could be raised. The largest initial public offering this year raised $8.1 billion for Uber. The largest IPO in history, Alibaba’s 2014 offering, raised around $25 billion.

Fannie and Freddie have incredibly complex equity structures. Fannie has common shares worth a total of $3.4 billion. The government has a contractual right to exercise warrants to 79.9 percent of the common equity, which at current the current valuation would be equal to around $13.6 billion. Each company has tens of billions of dollars of junior preferred which trade well-below face value now because the company has paid out dividends on them for over a decade and is barred from doing so without the consent of the Treasury Department.

In addition, the U.S. Treasury holds senior preferred shares that currently require the companies to pay nearly all of their positive net worth above an agreed upon amount of retained capital to the government’s coffers. In exchange for this so-called “net worth sweep,” the government gave up on an earlier right to a 10 percent annual dividend that was due even if the companies did not earn enough to pay it. A few years ago, the net worth sweep meant the government received far more than it would have under the 10 percent deal. Now it typically means the government receives billions of dollars less.

Then there is the government’s ongoing promise to supply them with new capital if they run into financial trouble–a promise that everyone agrees is absolutely vital to their ongoing ability to sell guaranteed mortgage bonds. The companies have never paid the commitment fee on this facility called for by their bailout agreement.

Finally, there is the special relationship the companies have with the Federal Reserve. The Fed has acquired hundreds of billions of dollars of their bonds since the financial crisis, making the central bank the biggest holder of their securities. This makes them unique and distinctly unprivate. Apart from Treasury bonds and the bonds of Ginnie Mae, a purely government entity, only Fannie and Freddie have the Fed as a customer for their product. In many years, the Fed has bought more Fannie and Freddie bonds than they have issued, highlighting just how significant these operations are for the companies.

Any transaction to take the companies private would require dealing with each of these pieces.

Any new equity issuance would exist the outstanding common shares, perhaps even the government’s yet unborn 80 percent stake. Raising enough capital to recapitalize the companies might be difficult if the new equity is on par with the current equity. New investors may press for the new shares to be subordinated or crammed down.

The Fed purchases would likely have to be phased out, which would test whether the market has enough appetite to absorb all of their issuances. It might also put unwelcome pressure on Treasury yields as the Fed would likely be forced to replace Fannie and Freddie paper with government bonds as the mortgage-backed securities rolled off its balance sheet.

Fannie and Freddie would have to begin paying for the ongoing backstop from Treasury, leaving less capital to meet FHFA requirements and ultimately less profit to entice new shareholders.

Most importantly, the senior preferred shares would need to be extinguished or severely modified. Obviously, so long as the government is entitled to all the profits, investors will stay away. Some have argued that the government could simply cancel the senior preferred shares, perhaps by deeming them repaid in full. Although the companies have now paid more in dividends than they received in the bailout, that could cause a political firestorm because the government would be essentially giving away an asset worth close to $315 billion for nothing.

While it is true that the government would then be able to exercise its warrants, these only give it 80 percent of the common and would subordinate the government’s interest to the junior preferred. In other words, the government would still be giving up tens of billions of dollars of value in exchange for nothing.

Making the politics even more difficult, this giveaway would result in a huge windfall for the current shareholders. The largest holders of both the common and the junior preferred are hedge funds run by billionaires. It seems unlikely that the Trump administration would want to walk through this political minefield while taking fire from populist rivals like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.

The $315 billion figure for the value of the senior preferred shares comes from very simple equity arithmetic. It is a little more than 13 times last year’s earnings, a bit higher than the price-to-earnings ratio of J.P. Morgan Chase.

But that $315 billion political landmine could also become a bridge to taking the companies private. Instead of simply canceling the senior preferred shares, the government could slowly auction them off. This would provide the government a solid return on its assets, allow for capital to be raised over time rather than in a one-shot IPO, and allow for the price to adjust as market conditions change. It would also give the mortgage market time to adjust to the slow-motion privatization of the companies.

New investors would be asked to step into the place of the U.S. government as the holders of shares that are entitled to all of the profits of the companies, something that would likely make them very attractive to investors. The sales of senior preferred would not themselves recapitalize the companies but they would transfer control and ownership while retained earnings built up the required capital buffer.

This would wipe out the existing common shares and perhaps the existing junior preferred shares. Their current total subordination would become permanent and lasting. No doubt some shareholders would challenge the move in court but after a long string of legal victories defending the net worth sweep, the threat of further litigation is unlikely to deter the government.

Shareholders assumed that Calabria’s drive to privatize Fannie and Freddie meant he was on their side. This may prove to be a costly error."

On August 15, 2019, Breitbart News reported Warren’s promise of “executive action in every corner” for gun control, should she be elected.

On October 2, 2019, Breitbart News reported Warren’s push for a federal limit on the number of guns an American can purchase. She admitted that limited gun purchases will not solve gun violence by itself, suggesting it is “not a one and done” issue, but a very broad issue requiring numerous laws, regulations, changes.

On October 15, 2019, Breitbart News reported Warren’s plan to use excise taxes to reduce firearm and ammunition sales. The plan to use excise taxes was published by Medium where readers saw Warren’s belief that the current ten percent excise tax on firearms is too low. She made clear she wants to raise that tax to 30 percent while increasing the tax on ammunition to 50 percent.

This would immediately raise the price of a $500 gun to $650 and would increase the price of a $20 box of ammo to $30. Such taxation could render the Second Amendment cost-prohibitive for the poor.

former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein",Lloyd Blankfein is worried that Elizabeth Warren could bring about a radical shift to America's economy.,2019-10-24,CNN,Lloyd Blankfein fears Elizabeth Warren wants 'cataclysmic change' for US economy,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/24/success/lloyd-blankfein-elizabeth-warren-boss-files/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Lloyd Blankfein is worried that Elizabeth Warren could bring about a radical shift to America's economy.

The formerCEO told CNN's Poppy Harlow in an exclusive interview on Thursday that Warren ""probably thinks more of cataclysmic change to the economic system as opposed to tinkering.""

That's riskier, Blankfein said, because America's economic system is the ""envy of the world.""

Blankfein, speaking at the CITIZEN by CNN conference in New York City, also pushed back against the recent argument byCEO Marc Benioff that capitalism as we know it is over

""Capitalism is not dead,"" said Blankfein, who stepped down as Goldman Sachs' CEO last fall. But he acknowledged that the system ""has to adapt,"" with an aim of making it fairer and preventing monopolies.

Paying more in taxes

Blankfein said that some of Bernie Sanders' ideas are good ones and he is open to the idea of wealth ""redistribution"" by changing the nation's tax structure.

""We have to listen to what people are saying and respond to it,"" he said. ""You know, you're not guaranteed stability in the world. Look at what's going on in Hong Kong.""

I sure as heck would be willing to pay more tax if it could buy a happier and less polarized society."" former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein

For instance, Blankfein thinks the rich could pay more in taxes.

""I'd like to pay no taxes, but I'd like to live in a civilized world where people aren't coming with torches and rakes trying to, you know, kill each other,"" said Blankfein. ""I sure as heck would be willing to pay more tax if it could buy a happier and less polarized society.""

Both Warren and Sanders have endorsed a tax on wealth. Warren has called for taxing fortunes of more than $50 million at 2% each year and wealth of more than $1 billion at 3%.

Blankfein said it's ""hard to imagine"" a wealth tax because it would be incredibly complicated to calculate. He noted that wealth taxes can take many years to sort out.

Even though Blankfein is a registered Democrat who supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, his career on Wall Street has made him unpopular with the liberal wing of the party. In July, Sanders put Blankfein on his list of ""anti-endorsements.""

Blankfein said that he's still a Democrat -- ""they haven't kicked me out yet"" -- but declined to name a 2020 candidate that he'd endorse.

""If I really wanted to hurt a Democratic candidate, I would give my full endorsement,"" he joked.

Tariffs are hurting. But are they necessary?

Blankfein also weighed in on the US-China trade war.

Although White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has downplayed the economic pain of the trade war, Blankfein conceded it's real.

""Of course, tariffs are hurting us,"" Blankfein said.

However, he suggested that the tariffs could be an effective tool for the United States to convince China to play fair on trade. He compared the tariffs to union workers who decide to go on strike.

""Is the union being hurt by striking General Motors? Of course, it is,"" Blankfein said. ""But they're relying on the fact that maybe GM is being hurt more. How else do you get your adversary to the bargaining table?""

The trade war has exacerbated the global economic slowdown and increased the risk of a recession in the United States.

But Blankfein doesn't sound overly concerned that the economic expansion, already the longest in American history, will come to a sudden end.

Although he joked that he ""wrote the book on paranoia,"" he suggested the economy may keep humming along -- unless some sort of a shock emerges.

Not all shocks are bad, Blankfein said, noting that a positive shock, such as a resolution to the trade war, is possible.

""The base case is that the economy is motoring along fairly well, but nothing lasts forever,"" he said."

Katie Porter of California, a first-term lawmaker who has gained wide notice for her forceful grilling of corporate executives in congressional hearings, plans to endorse Sen. Elizabeth Warren for president, two people familiar with the decision told CNN.

Porter, who captured a historically Republican district in 2018, is one of the highest-profile members of the freshman class, and just this week she conducted a scathing interrogation of Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, on Capitol Hill.

Her expected endorsement is a coup for Warren, whose rise in the polls has not yet been matched by support from Democratic elected officials. It would also be a blow to Porter's fellow Californian, Sen. Kamala Harris, who has been counting on her home state's primary to help her mount a comeback in the race.

Spokespeople for Warren and Porter declined to comment.

Both Warren and Harris are personally close with Porter, and both senators endorsed her in a competitive primary election last year. Porter is a former student of Warren's at Harvard Law School and, like Warren, is an expert on bankruptcy law. Porter worked closely with Harris when the senator was the attorney general of California, helping oversee a major legal settlement between the state and mortgage lenders.

Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) immigration plan, which opens the border to all foreign nationals, was drafted by a handful of illegal alien staffers.

A report by the Wall Street Journal reveals that three illegal aliens working for Sanders’ 2020 Democrat presidential primary campaign helped craft the democratic-socialists’ plan to decriminalize illegal immigration, end deportations, and stop federal immigration raids.

All three illegal alien Sanders staffers have been allowed to stay in the U.S. through former President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

The Journal notes:

The campaign has a Latino outreach program that spans every early state, and has held specific events tailored to the Latino community in Iowa and California. (California holds its primary on March 3, a month after Iowa. But voters can begin mail-in voting the same day as Iowa.) Of the 542 paid staff on the campaign in the third quarter, at least 70 are Latino, according to the campaign. Three of the staff members who worked on Mr. Sanders’s immigration policy are beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. [Emphasis added]

Despite repeatedly denouncing open borders and its impact on the quality of life, wages, and economic opportunities of America’s working and middle class, Sanders’ 2020 immigration plan endorses policies that end federal immigration enforcement.

Like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sanders is promising to decriminalize illegal immigration to the U.S., making it only a civil violation to cross international borders. Similarly, Sanders has introduced a plan to at least temporarily end raids and deportations by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.

As Breitbart News reported in March, a Federal Election Commission (FEC) complaint was filed against Sanders’ campaign for his hiring of the three DACA illegal aliens. The complaint alleges that Sanders’ hiring of foreign nationals for advisory jobs on his campaign equates to foreign election interference.

(Not listed was former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX), whose campaign ejected this reporter from an event at Benedict in August.)

Trump signed the First Step Act last year, providing opportunities for certain federal prisoners to reduce their sentences by committing to more intensive rehabilitation programs, including job and skills training.

Some conservatives were skeptical of the legislation, but Trump earned bipartisan praise from within the black community.

Democratic candidates have tended to ignore the new law in making pledges for new criminal justice reforms, as if unwilling to acknowledge Trump’s success.

They will have trouble avoiding it this weekend.

Though Soros has often pushed for free trade, he told the Times that China had not played by the rules and that its values were at odds with those of the “open society” to which he had devoted his political life:

“I consider Xi Jinping’s China the worst threat to an open society,” he said of China’s president, repeating a declaration he made this year in Davos, Switzerland, that prompted China to retort, “We hope the relevant American can correct his attitude.” Mr. Soros, who has long encouraged free trade as a strategy to open up otherwise closed countries, said that the strategy had not worked in China the way he had expected and that more intervention was needed. Mr. Soros, pointing a finger in the air, called China “a mortal enemy” and said the West gave it too much of the benefit of the doubt. “We should recognize it: It’s a different system. It’s totally opposed to ours, diametrically opposed to ours,” he said. Perhaps to qualify his words, he added: “I’m not anti-Chinese at all. I’m just anti Xi Jinping.”

Soros’s words echo an op-ed he published in the Wall Street Journal last month in which he praised President Donald Trump’s policy of confronting China as a “great achievement.”

Though Soros told the Times that he expected the political pendulum to swing back to “globalists” (his word), and said he expected Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to be the Democratic Party nominee (without endorsing her), his feelings on China are firmly in line with those of the Trump administration.

""In this time of crisis in our politics, it is not surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law to bring an end to his disastrous presidency,"" Kate Bedingfield, Biden's deputy campaign manager, said in a statement. ""Nothing changes unless we defeat Donald Trump.""

The statement, which is a stark shift in the position of the Biden campaign, came after CNN reported a coalition of top Democratic strategists and donors loyal to Biden were moving closer to setting up a super PAC to help the former vice president's candidacy.

The idea of building an outside organization had been the subject of discussion for weeks by Biden allies, but the conversations intensified in the wake of a cash crunch for the former vice president's campaign. Biden reported last week having less than $9 million in the bank, significantly less than his leading rivals.

Larry Rasky, the former Biden aide who is spearheading the effort to stand up the super PAC, responded to the Biden campaign by pledging to ""have (Biden's) back.""

""We intend to fight back against the lies and distortions we're seeing now from Trump, his allies, the Russians, and the Republican Party. While other candidates have groups supporting their efforts, no other Democrat has to fight this two-front war,"" Rasky said.

While Biden had previously spoken out against the creation of a super PAC, which would operate entirely separately from his campaign, several longtime allies say it's clear that his presidential bid needs help. No final decision has been made about launching the outside group, but allies have started contacting potential vendors and lining up possible donors to fuel a super PAC, sources familiar with the efforts tell CNN.

""They know they can use all the help they can get,"" one Biden ally told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the group. ""Trump is crushing him with spending.""

In the statement on Thursday, Bedingfield said Biden would ""push to remove private money from our federal elections"" if he won the White House.

But it was also clear Biden has no intention of unilaterally disarming in the wake of the attacks from Trump, with Bedingfield saying: ""He and his allies are already spending massive amounts of money on paid television and digital advertising to intervene directly in the Democratic primaries with the goal of preventing Joe Biden, the opponent that Trump fears most, from becoming the Democratic nominee.""

The Biden campaign's apparent reversal drew immediate criticism Thursday from one of his rivals, Bernie Sanders. In a statement, Sanders' campaign manager Faiz Shakir said Biden was ""endorsing an effort to buy the primary through a super PAC that can rake in unlimited cash from billionaires and corporations.""

Shakir called it ""a recipe to maintain a corrupt political system.""

The group End Citizens United, which opposes unlimited money in politics, also blasted the former vice president.

""It is incredibly disappointing to see Vice President Biden completely reverse his position now that times are tough,"" group president Tiffany Miller said in a statement. ""This is exactly the time he needs support from real people the most. We urge him to reconsider this decision and disavow this super PAC.""

The potential outside group would be comprised of longtime Biden supporters and admirers from the Obama-Biden administration who believe the former vice president has the best chance of defeating Trump. But they worry he is unable to compete in the Democratic primary while simultaneously fighting back against Trump.

Biden's fundraising haul last quarter totaled nearly $15.7 million, but the candidate spent more than he raised, ending the quarter with $8.98 million cash on hand. Biden is outmatched in cash reserves by South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has amassed a stockpile of $33.7 million.

Biden's allies are most concerned about combating the attacks coming from Trump. His reelection campaign, joint fundraising committees and the Republican National Committee ended the quarter with a combined $158 million cash on hand. Trump's massive war chest has already been used to target Biden and Democrats with millions of dollars in campaign ads in the wake of the Ukraine controversy, which prompted an impeachment inquiry into the President.

The former vice president recently told reporters he's ""confident"" his campaign will have the resources to engage in a potentially long primary fight despite the fundraising lag.

""Remember we got started later than anybody at all in this campaign, number one. Number two, we did not start off by dropping $10 million from a Senate campaign, wherever that money was raised from into a race,"" Biden said in Columbus following the debate last week. ""We're doing fine, our fundraising is building. We've raised a lot of money online, and we've raised money offline as well, so we feel confident we're going to be ready.""

A Biden adviser says the campaign has raised as much money online during the first two weeks of October as it did during the entire month of September.

Yet there is deep concern inside the Biden campaign and among his supporters.

Campaign filings show that one-quarter of Biden's spending in the July to September period went to payroll, and his campaign spent more than $920,000 on private charter flights in that same timeframe. Additionally, the Biden campaign spent $2 million on digital advertising and media ad buys last quarter, and earlier this month, it announced a $6 million digital and broadcast ad campaign in the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.

""We're comfortable with where we are, and we're comfortable with the investments we've made to date,"" said Pete Kavanaugh, deputy campaign manager for Biden. ""We feel we have more than enough resources to execute as we want to over the next 90 days as we head into Iowa.""

""There's not going to be any changes in the plans because this is where we planned to be,"" added Kavanaugh.

Biden has dedicated a significant portion of his time to traditional high dollar fundraisers, attending more than 70 donor events since he launched his campaign. But he's lagged in small-dollar donations, which have powered the fundraising apparatus of Sanders and Warren, who both have eschewed big-dollar fundraising in their campaigns.

The former vice president has relied on maxed-out contributors for 38% of the money he's raised so far in his presidential bid, according to an analysis of financial disclosure reports, giving the candidate fewer opportunities than many of his rivals to return to loyal donors again for cash as the Democratic primary campaign heats up.

More than $14 million of the $37.6 million Biden collected from individual contributors through the end of September came from donors who gave $2,800 or more to his bid for his party's presidential nomination, according to a tally provided to CNN by the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute, which examines money in politics.

By comparison, just 3% and 5% of the money raised by his Sanders and Warren, respectively, came from donors who donated at least $2,800 -- the maximum an individual can donate to a candidate for a primary election.

By contrast, Warren and Sanders have fueled their campaigns largely with online small-dollar contributors, who can be tapped repeatedly for money before hitting the $2,800 limit on primary donations. Nearly 70% of the individual contributions that Sanders has raised so far came from donors giving $200 or less; Warren has a similar profile, at about 64%.

Biden's share of individual contributions raised from small dollar donors during the course of the campaign stands at roughly 35%.

Joe Trippi, a veteran Democratic strategist, said Biden has enough money, right now.

""He can get through the early states without much of a problem, but if he stumbles during that period, his money could easily dry up,"" Trippi said. ""He's working without a net at that point. It's hard to see how small-dollar Internet money would flow for him at that moment, and the maxed-out donors can't do more.""

In recent days, the Biden campaign has intensified its pleas for money, pointing out in urgent fundraising requests the significant gap in campaign cash with some of his leading rivals.

""Right now, we're trailing Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders' cash-on-hand by big margins,"" Biden wrote in a fundraising e-mail Tuesday morning. ""We've got to make up lost ground quickly.""

A source close to the campaign acknowledged they intend to try dramatically ramping up their digital focus aiming to increase contributions and support, but it's not clear what immediate adjustments might be made to their fundraising operation.

""What you've got here is clearly the frontrunner for the entire time and a finance team that can't capitalize on that,"" said John Morgan, a Florida attorney who held a fundraiser for Biden earlier this year. ""Changes have to be made, and you know, Joe Biden is probably the nicest guy in the world, and it may be hard for him to do that, but too much is at stake not to do it.""

Since the start of his presidential bid, Biden's campaign has said he would disavow any spending from a super PAC.

But as he faces an onslaught of attacks from Trump and sluggish fundraising numbers, several allies say it's time for him to accept the help. Bernard Schwartz, a private investor and donor to the former vice president's campaign, said he spoke with Biden within the last two weeks and encouraged him to do just that.

""People out there need some assurance that he has other, additional funds that he expects to come in,"" Schwartz said.

This story has been updated with the Biden campaign's response to the creation of a potential super PAC."

The Amazon chief had an estimated total net worth of $111 billion as of Thursday’s close of trading, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which updates its list of the wealthiest people in the world on a daily basis.

If Amazon shares continue to fall Friday, Bezos could lose his No. 1 spot to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, whose net worth is pegged at $107 billion. Bloomberg estimated that Gates overtook Bezos in early trading Friday, as Amazon shares were down as much as 4 percent, though the stock has recovered some of its losses.

Forbes estimated that Bezos actually fell to the No. 2 spot late Thursday, when Amazon shares dipped 7 percent in after-hours trading.

But his decline wasn’t completely the result of Amazon’s share price, according to Forbes. Bezos recently transferred a quarter of his Amazon stake to his ex-wife, MacKenzie, as part of their highly publicized divorce.

Amazon disappointed Wall Street on Thursday when it reported its first decline in profits in about two years, with net income dropping 26 percent. The news sent Amazon shares plummeting 9 percent in after-hours trading.

In addition to running Amazon, Bezos’ empire also includes the Washington Post.

Other high-ranking U.S. billionaires on Bloomberg’s list include Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett at No. 4 and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg at No. 5.

Here's why,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/25/perspectives/gm-uaw-strike-deal/index.html,"Christopher Douglas is an associate professor of economics at the University of Michigan-Flint and a member of the Board of Scholars at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

On Friday, the United Auto Workers voted to ratify its agreement with General Motors, bringing the nearly five-week-long strike to an end. Although it won some short-term pay increases and job protections for workers, the union failed to get GM to reopen the Lordstown, Ohio assembly plant and transmission plants in Warren, Michigan and Baltimore, Maryland. The union's inability to win big concessions from GM -- even after a prolonged strike -- shouldn't come as that big of a surprise. They were likely never possible in the first place.

In order to win substantial concessions, a union needs to bargain against a firm that has substantial market power and profits. This was GM in the 1950s and '60s, when the company by itself controlled nearly half of the US auto market. The GM of today is different.

It has continued to fall ever since. Despite its $11.8 billion profits in 2018, GM continues to have severe vulnerabilities. GM's 2018 market share is 16.6%, down from 23.2% in 2007, the last year before the Great Recession. By the time GM entered bankruptcy in 2009, it was already losing ground and its market share was down to nearly 19%.Ithas continued to fall ever since.

The company's loss of market share post-bankruptcy has left it with substantial excess production capacity and the fixed costs associated with maintaining those underutilized plants. This explains why the company was unwilling to budge on plant closures, such as the one in Lordstown

rose nationwide from 6.8 million to 17.7 million over that period. But the vast majority of growth in the US auto market over the last 50-plus years benefited foreign automakers like Toyota, Honda and Nissan. Thus, GM finds itself in a weakened state compared to the heyday of the 1960s, when unions could use prolonged strikes to win generous concessions from the automaker. More disconcerting is that GM sold fewer cars in 2018 than it did in 1961, despite the US working age population rising by 103 million people over that time. Total vehicle salesrose nationwide from 6.8 million to 17.7 million over that period.

Decades of harsh laws and sentencing requirements have ""disproportionately targeted people of color and ruined the lives of millions of Americans,"" Sanders said in a statement. ""When we're in the White House, we're going to end the greed and corruption of the big corporations and make sure that Americans hit hardest by the war on drugs will be the first to benefit from legalization.""

Sanders unveiled the blueprint ahead of his appearance Saturday at the Second Step Presidential Justice Forum at Benedict College, an HBCU in South Carolina. The proposal takes a number of specific steps to address the disproportionately destructive impact federal drug policy has had on the African American community. The capital grant program will be would be administered through the Minority Business Development Agency.

As part of the plan, Sanders would create a federal clemency board to deal with past marijuana-related convictions, similar to a panel established in California. That body would instruct state and federal authorities to review all applicable cases to determine if a new or vacated sentence is required. It would also give prosecutors one year to appeal any decision, after which those convictions would be immediately vacated or expunged.

The 2020 Democratic candidates broadly agree on the need to reverse or roll back current drug laws. Decriminalizing possession and reducing sentencing guidelines, at the least, are popular among many of the leading primary contenders. But there is some disagreement over the scope of the reforms being suggested.

Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren have said they would effectively legalize marijuana by executive action, with Sanders pledging to do it in his first 100 days in office. Their Senate colleague Cory Booker has been a leading reform advocate and his Marijuana Justice Bill counts Sanders, Warren, Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Michael Bennet among its co-sponsors.

South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg supports decriminalizing the possession of all drugs including marijuana, and said Wednesday during a visit to a marijuana dispensary in Nevada that past marijuana convictions should be expunged. Former Vice President Joe Biden does not back full legalization, saying he would leave that decision to the states. He would downgrade marijuana's federal classification, to schedule II, which is the same as cocaine.

At Sanders' rally this past weekend in Queens, the first after he returned to the campaign following a heart attack, he teased a plan to free prisoners convicted of certain drug-related crimes.

""We are going to end the horrifically destructive war on drugs and legalize marijuana,"" Sanders said, tying the cause to a broader criminal and racial justice message. ""And we are going to end the disgrace of 400,000 people right now locked behind bars because they are too poor to afford cash bail.""

In seeking to prevent major corporations from seizing on wider scale legalization, Sanders plans to incentive marijuana growers and distributors who choose to start non-profit or community co-op businesses that would benefit local economies. Existing companies that sell tobacco and cigarettes, along with those ""that have created cancer-causing products or (are) guilty of deceptive marketing"" would be locked out of the market, according to the Sanders plan.

At an event in Iowa in September, the Vermont independent promised that he was going to shift the bounty of marijuana sales from big corporations to the people who have been most heavily impacted by current, or only recently reversed, drug laws.

""I go to Nevada, and there are these big billboards, I don't know if you've seen, and it says buy this or that brand of marijuana, have you seen this? They are advertising hemp,"" Sanders said. ""And I'm thinking that there are people in jail for doing exactly what these large corporations are doing, selling marijuana."""

His next target: America,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/23/business/paytm-vijay-shekhar-sharma-risk-takers/index.html,"To say that Vijay Shekhar Sharma is ambitious is an understatement. The founder of Paytm, India's largest digital payments company, has already revolutionized the way 400 million people spend money — whether it's buying dinner, paying an electric bill or sending money to a friend.

Over the course of his career, he's also ventured into online retail, banking and even gaming.

But he's not done yet. Sharma wants to bring at least half a billion Indians into the banking system through Paytm's app. He also wants to put Paytm on the global map alongside the Googles and Facebooks of the world.

His business philosophy is fuelled by a phrase that echoes throughout Paytm's office in Noida, an industrial hub on the outskirts of New Delhi: ""Go Big or Go Home."" The concept is driven home on a frosted glass wall of Paytm's main boardroom, on office stationery and on countless coffee mugs in its pantry.

It's an outlook that has helped Sharma, 41, grow Paytm into a company valued at $15 billion in less than a decade.

But with that growth comes the risk of doing too much too fast.

Paytm is fighting battles with deep-pocketed rivals on several fronts, and losing those battles could mean missing a huge opportunity. India already has more than 600 million internet users, but, crucially, there are nearly 800 million Indians yet to go online for the first time

Sharma has a sizeable war chest of his own, thanks to investors like Chinese tech giant Alibaba, Japanese behemoth SoftBank and Warren Buffett. But even so, Paytm is dwarfed by the companies it is trying to fend off — Google, Facebook, Amazon and Walmart— all of which have already spent billions of dollars trying to get a piece of the action in India.

That hasn't stopped Sharma from wanting to take the fight to them. He has started a push to take Paytm global, with all roads leading to the United States and a battle with a fresh set of competitors including Venmo, Square and Apple Pay.

A decade of driving digital payments

In India, Paytm is best known as a one-stop shop for digital payments. You can use it to send money to a friend, like Venmo, or to pay for anything from bus tickets to utility bills using your smartphone.

Millions of shopkeepers across India also now accept Paytm, prominently displaying QR codes that can be scanned with the phone's camera to pay for purchases.

""What we've changed in this country is that now you don't need to actually carry a wallet, or a card, or a currency,"" Sharma told CNN Business.

Paytm's journey began back in 2000, when Sharma founded its parent company, One97 Communications . One97 started as a mobile services platform offering horoscopes to cellular network providers before expanding into other services like voice-based gaming and customized ringtones.

Paytm came a decade later, launched in 2010 as a platform for buying prepaid cellphone plans and paying cable bills online.

""Vijay was at an interesting crossroads. He was the majority shareholder in One97... the company was growing well and very profitable,"" said Ravi Adusumalli, a managing partner at private equity firm SAIF Partners and One97's first institutional investor.

""He could have easily sold the company and retired, or he could invest 100% of his net worth into creating a new company,"" added Adusumalli, who serves on One97's board of directors. ""He clearly made the right choice, but it wasn't obvious at the time.""

What we've changed in this country is that now you don't need to actually carry a wallet, or a card, or a currency."" Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder of Paytm

The One97 board wasn't convinced Sharma should invest aggressively in a consumer business, since all of its previous endeavors had been B2B. India's smartphone boom had yet to take off, and the country had fewer than 140 million internet users. But Adusumalli said the board compromised and gave Sharma a small amount of money to invest and see how it went. Sharma also put in $2 million of his own money to get Paytm off the ground.

""When the results came back positive, my recommendation was to 'go big or go home,'"" said Adusumalli. ""Trying to do something incremental would lead to certain failure, so he needed to decide whether he wanted to risk One97 for Paytm.""

It was Sharma's first big risk. Had Paytm failed to take off in the way it did, it could have doomed the company he'd spent a decade building. Missing the boat on India's internet boom would have been difficult to recover from.

The milestones for Sharma have kept coming. In 2012, Paytm got approval from India's central bank to launch the mobile wallet that now forms the core of its business. In 2014, it partnered with Uber to become a payment option for the company's cab rides across India, and in 2015 it snagged another big partnership with the online booking portal for Indian Railways, which sells nearly 700,000 tickets a day and 25 million tickets a year.

But the app really exploded in November 2016, when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi suddenly banned the country's two biggest currency notes — around 86% of the country's cash at the time — with the aim of cracking down on tax evasion and illegal wealth.

The move shocked India's economy , where vast the majority of transactions are made in cash. Millions of people spent weeks lining up at ATMs to exchange their currency notes just so they would have enough money for everyday expenses.

But those who had smartphones started switching to mobile payment apps, and Paytm was primed and ready. The app signed 10 million new users within a month of the cash ban, going from adding tens of thousands of people a day to around half a million.

The cash ban ""made us a folklore name in this country,"" Sharma said. And while its rate of growth is no longer as rapid as it was back then, Paytm has more than doubled its user base in the last two and a half years to 400 million.

Paytm's growth is reflected in digital payments overall as well. The average number of cashless payments per person per year in India has gone from 2.4 to 22.4 in the last five years, according to a report commissioned by the country's central bank published in May.

But cash still rules. Despite the growth of digital payments, the value of currency in circulation increased by 17% to more than 21 trillion rupees ($296 billion) in the past financial year, according to the central bank. That's around ten times the value of mobile payment transactions over the same period.

""India remains a largely cash-driven economy. Economic growth has been possible through many transactions that are done primarily in cash,"" the report said.

""The biggest challenge that we face comes from customers' ability or intent to pay digitally,"" Sharma said. ""Paytm and the mobile payment has taken off, but still there is a huge amount of resistance.""

Driven by ambition

Sharma grew up in Aligarh, a small town about 100 miles south of India's capital, New Delhi. He finished high school by the time he was 14 and graduated from the Delhi College of Engineering at age 19, according to a blog post on Paytm's website.

But Sharma didn't speak much English and struggled to understand what was being taught in class. He got through college by reading two versions of the textbooks — one in English and the other in his native Hindi. He would also spend a lot of time in the college computer lab, according to the blog post, ""browsing the internet and dreaming about being in Silicon Valley.""

By the time he graduated, Sharma had taught himself to code and already had his first startup under his belt. He cofounded a company called XS Communications that made content management systems used by several major Indian publications. The company was sold to a US entrepreneur for $1 million in 1999.

He spent the next year trying to set up One97, taking on significant debt that he paid off by doing odd jobs like setting up internet connections for paying customers. It would take nearly two decades for him to become one of India's youngest billionaires and a household name in the country. To many Indians, he is the recognizable face of the digital payments company he founded. ( Forbes has his net worth at $2.4 billion.)

""Vijay is the heart and soul of Paytm. He honestly never stops with new ideas,"" said Adusumalli.

Big battles at home

Paytm will need every ounce of Sharma's ambition in the coming months in order to hold on to its dominant position in India, as the biggest names in tech and retail use their deep pockets to eat into business on his home turf.

Google launched its digital payment service, Google Pay, in India two years ago , and has signed up more than 67 million users. PhonePe, owned by Walmart, has 150 million users. Amazon also has its own digital payment platform, Amazon Pay, and added person-to-person digital payments earlier this year.

And an even bigger rival is waiting in the wings. WhatsApp, the mobile messaging app owned by Facebook, which has more than 400 million users in India, is gearing up to launch its own payments service

These companies already have large user bases for their core services, which gives them a running start when trying to add users to their payment platforms.

""The biggest challenge [for Paytm] will be from the competition point of view — to make sure people stay on their platform,"" says Tarun Pathak, an analyst at Counterpoint Research.

Paytm wants to offer more services to its millions of users, starting with an e-commerce portal called Paytm Mall, backed by Alibaba. Launched in 2017, it's aimed at cashing in on India's online retail market, which Morgan Stanley forecasts will be worth $200 billion by 2027.

But while Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart have taken over the market and disrupted India's millions of smaller retailers, Paytm Mall has failed to make much of an inroad. The platform has a little over 3% of the Indian market, compared to more than 30% each for Amazon and Flipkart.

There are other potential hurdles as well: New Indian regulations requiring digital payment firms to do more background checks on their consumers could drastically increase costs. Heavy regulations govern Paytm's other businesses, including banking, loans and insurance. One97 is also racking up losses — its total loss in the financial year that ended in March 2019 was nearly 40 billion rupees ($560 million), a 165% increase from the previous year, according to multiple media reports . It also reportedly has around $96 million in debt.

""We have invested more in consumer and merchant growth,"" a company spokesperson said, adding that it aims to reduce losses by ""more than 25%"" this year.

But Sharma is confident he can make it all work. He's practically evangelical about helping bring millions of Indians into the mainstream banking system.

""I say to my team that our mission is so pious that God will give us a way to do what we want to do,"" he said. ""I believe that God above will take care of us, giants will give way and stumbling blocks will disappear on our way.""

In fact, he wants to start preparing for an initial public offering by the end of next year.

Going global

Sharma's latest bet is not a new business but a new country. Last year, he teamed up with Yahoo! Japan and one of Paytm's biggest investors, SoftBank, to launch a mobile payment app called PayPay in Japan. The app signed up 10 million users and brought a million stores onto its platform in its first 10 months, and Sharma wants to cash in on a huge influx of tourists for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

Samsung SSNLF Line LN But it's a big leap for a cash-obsessed country: 80% of transactions in Japan still use cash, and even the digital payment pie is split between big players like, Apple and popular messaging app. While the early signs for Paytm have been encouraging, it's a long road ahead.

""It is tough to convince a Japanese business unless they are totally convinced. And there is not a 'let me try' attitude there; it has to work perfectly well,"" Sharma told CNN Business in early August.

I say to my team that our mission is so pious that God will give us a way to do what we want to do. I believe that God above will take care of us, giants will give way and stumbling blocks will disappear on our way."" Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder of Paytm

He makes no secret of his global ambitions. Every meeting room on Paytm's main floor is named after a major global city: New York, London, Seoul, Barcelona, Dubai.

There's also Hangzhou, the headquarters of Paytm's biggest investor Alibaba. ""That's for Jack Ma,"" he said, referring to Alibaba's billionaire co-founder. ""And we have Tokyo for Masa Son,"" the CEO of SoftBank.

Berkshire Hathaway BRKA There's also an Omaha room, he added, where legendary investor Warren Buffett is based. Paytm last year became the first Indian company that Buffett'sinvested in.

Sharma told CNN Business last year that he wants to get all three men in the same room for a board meeting. But he has an even bigger dream.

""Look, the ultimate dreamland for tech entrepreneurs is if America becomes a market,"" he said. ""For us, it's an ambition, very outspokenly stated, that we would love to be a part of the American economy where we can serve American citizens.""

Sharma is already fighting several battles at home and abroad, but he's confident that he can make it happen.

""The success of Japan tells us that our technology is up to that mark ... just like where we got Masa Son as a partner in Japan, if we get some partner like that, we're headed to the US soon,"" he said. ""We would love to start the journey ASAP, but we would have to build our finances well for [the] US market... inshallah if it happens soon, then we are going to do it soon.""

Adusumalli, who says his founder-investor relationship with Sharma has evolved into a ""strong friendship with a great deal of mutual trust,"" says the United States is still far behind countries like China when it comes to online payments, creating a potential opportunity for Paytm.

Only 55 million people in the United States used mobile payments last year, according to research firm eMarketer — about 20% of the population. That's just a fraction of China's 525 million users . Even India, where less than half the population uses smartphones, had around 74 million people making mobile payments, eMarketer said

""While India is a large and growing market, it requires a great deal of patience. The U.S. is appealing because it is a massive market and payments are antiquated relative to what is happening in China,"" he said. ""Vijay sees an opportunity to being a disruptor in a market that is very profitable for incumbents.""

It would be a huge bet — but Sharma is used to seeing those pay off.

""I think I've been lucky that in my life I had to take risks without even thinking of downfalls because I did not start with a lot of things that I could have lost,"" he said.

Clues about how he approaches risk are all over the walls of Paytm's offices. ""Just because they say it's impossible doesn't mean you can't do it,"" reads one poster. ""No bird soars in a calm,"" reads another.

""If you don't give yourself a chance, who will? If you don't take a chance, who will?"" Sharma says. ""And I think you should take a chance on you."""

This year, month after month, he has drawn most of the major presidential candidates to his doorstep and championed ""Medicare for All"" while forcing the presidential contenders to think through the impact of their health care agendas in the most personal terms.

He brought California Sen. Kamala Harris to tears recalling the day her mother was diagnosed with colon cancer. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren used Barkan's case to punctuate the failures of the healthcare system during a July presidential debate: ""Ady has health insurance, good health insurance, and it's not nearly enough,"" she said.

Barkan and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the author of the Medicare for All legislation, discussed their legacies during their conversation, which was posted online in early September.

""In terms of your legacy, Ady,"" Sanders told Barkan, ""I think it will be very clear that even with the terrible illness that you're struggling with right now, that you didn't give up, that you understood that -- especially given your illness -- that you could play a significant in rallying the American people toward a sane and humane health care system.""

In the latest interview released Thursday with Pete Buttigieg , the South Bend, Indiana Mayor told Barkan that it was the first time he'd been around breathing equipment since the death of his father, who had cancer, in January.

""We sat down with a social worker who basically explained to us at the hospital that in terms of long term care our best option was probably for our family to spend down everything that we had until we were asset-poor enough to qualify for Medicaid,"" Buttigieg told Barkan, according to the transcript shared with CNN. ""I remember just thinking, is that how this works in America?""

The two debated their differing views on Medicare for All, and Barkan told Buttigieg he appreciated that the mayor was ""willing to have the tough conversations even when someone doesn't agree with you.""

In their exchange, Barkan called out former Vice President Joe Biden, who Barkan says is the only top-tier presidential candidate who has not responded to his invitation to meet.

On September 18, he issued a searing plea to Biden, noting that Biden has his own heartbreaking struggles involving the healthcare system (most recently with the death of his son Beau in 2015 from a brain tumor).

""Mr. Vice President you know about illness. You know about doctors and hospitals. You know that health care is personal. ... You won't come talk to me about it?"" Barkan said in video missive to Biden the day before undergoing surgery for a tracheostomy to help him breathe. ""Look a dying man in the eyes and tell me how we fix this country.""

In an interview with CNN this month, Barkan described ALS as ""the story of things becoming impossible"" -- from a simple stroll around the neighborhood to his ability to tickle his 3-year-old son Carl. ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, ultimately depriving the brain of its ability to initiate and control muscle movement, including the loss of speech. (Barkan now speaks through a computer).

""It's exhausting and overwhelming,"" Barkan told CNN. ""For me, ALS has been a lesson in exactly how broken our health care system is and why it's so important to fix it.""

In this family photo, Barkan is pictured with his wife Rachael and son Carl in October 2016.

Barkan, a life-long advocate on economic justice issues who was diagnosed with ALS in October 2016, has imparted those lessons not only with high-profile testimony in Washington, but also in these intimate one-on-one conversations with candidates.

He and his crew film publish the interviews as part of the work of their PAC, the Be A Hero fund, which attempts to hold politicians accountable on health care and other issues by using the stories of average Americans as their persuasion tool.

Barkan realized the power of his exchanges with politicians when he met former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake by chance in December 2017 on an airplane. Overwhelmed by his mounting medical bills, Barkan urged Flake not to support the GOP tax bill, which he believed would disrupt his health care coverage. ""You can save my life,"" Barkan told Flake in a n exchange captured by a fellow passenger . ""Please remember this conversation."" Flake did end up voting for the tax bill -- in contradiction to Barkan's request -- but that exchange vaulted Barkan into the national spotlight.

As Barkan has explained to the current crop of presidential candidates, his insurance company tried to deny coverage for a breathing assistance machine that he needed to live. He said he, his wife Rachael, an assistant and a lawyer spent ""endless time on the phone trying to get our insurance company to behave properly, lawfully. Beyond that, his family is billed $20,000 a month out of pocket for the 24-hour home care that he needs.

""I'm lucky to have wealthy supporters cover the cost for us, but that's not an option for a lot of people -- most just go bankrupt,"" he told CNN, which provided questions to Barkan ahead of time to give him enough time to write out answers.

""Ninety percent of Americans with ALS choose not to go on a ventilator because it requires 24-hour care, which most insurance plans don't cover. In Japan, where long-term care is guaranteed, the numbers are reversed. That just isn't right, and it doesn't need to be this way.""

That view has fueled Barkan's advocacy for Medicare for All, the signature health care proposal from Sanders: ""I've come to believe that fundamentally we need radical, disruptive change to the status quo,"" he said. ""The only plan I've seen that aims for that level of ambition is Medicare for All.""

He believes that any plan that stops short of the promise of Medicare for All -- the kinds of plans that have been proposed by Buttigieg, Biden and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, for example — ""won't deliver the universal coverage or the cost savings that we need.""

Barkan testifies before the House Rules Committee at a hearing on a ""Medicare for All"" bill on Capitol Hill in April 2019.

Barkan, who gets around in a wheelchair, speaks through a vocalizer and takes his meals through a feeding tube in his stomach, has still managed to make his sense of urgency felt through in-depth conversations with Buttigieg, Sanders, Harris, Warren, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, and Julián Castro, the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Barack Obama.

He says Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and businessman Asndrew Yang have also agreed to meet with him. The Be A Hero PAC has started a petition calling on Biden to meet with Barkan. Biden's team did not respond to CNN's query about why the former vice president has not responded to Barkan's invitation.

But Barkan isn't giving up on his hope for a one-on-one with one of the 2020 race's front-runners.

It's a persistence that New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez notes in the prologue she wrote for his new memoir, ""Eyes to the Wind.""

Even through his vocalizer, Barkan's testimony to Congress ""forced an urgency and moral clarity that members could not look away from or ignore,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote.

""I saw their discomfort at issuing the usual excuses, and Ady also would not tolerate them—even with many physical capabilities gone,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote.

The New York Democrat first met Barkan when he stopped by a labor town hall that she was holding at a church in the Bronx after winning her primary election last year. He could still speak at that point and she held the microphone for him as he addressed the crowd.

They met again this year, at her congressional office after the his testimony to Congress.

Barkan acknowledges that part of the power of his advocacy is that he is dying from ALS, a fact he points out in his Twitter profile. He told CNN he is ""trying to use the time I have left here to make things better for as long as I still can.""

""If I could be healthy and completely anonymous, I would do it in a heartbeat,"" he said. But because of his illness, his activism with Be a Hero and the Center for Popular Democracy have drawn national notice. His team went on to travel the country making health-care ads that he said were among the top-performing spots of 2018.

""We built a platform that made it hard for candidates to ignore us,"" Barkan said. ""There are millions of folks who the candidates should sit down with. I'm just hoping I can be a voice for them and force candidates to answer questions that really matter to people."""

Striking General Motors factory workers will put down their picket signs after approving a new contract that will end a 40-day strike that paralyzed the company’s U.S. production.

The United Auto Workers union said in a statement Friday that workers had approved the new four-year deal. But no vote totals were given. The union says it will announce shortly whether it will bargain next with Ford or Fiat Chrysler.

Picket lines were to come down immediately, and skilled trades workers will begin restarting factories that were shuttered when 49,000 workers walked out on Sept. 16. Some production workers could return as early as Friday night.

The deal includes a mix of wage increases and lump-sum payments and an $11,000 signing bonus. But GM will close three U.S. factories that make slow-selling cars and transmissions. Analysts estimate the strike cost GM more than $2 billion.

The five-week walkout was big enough to help push down September U.S. durable goods orders by 1.1%, the largest drop in four months.

Trades workers such as machinists and electricians likely will enter the plants quickly, restarting boilers and preparing paint shops, robots and other equipment to restart production.

On the picket line at a transmission plant in Romulus, Michigan, worker Tricia Pruitt said the wage gains were worth staying off the job for more than five weeks, but she’s ready to return to work.

Pruitt, a 15-year GM employee, was happy that the contract brings workers hired after 2007 up to the same wage as older workers in four years.

She’ll be glad not to be on the picket line if the strike ends. “Look at us now. We’re in coats,” she said on a gray, chilly Friday afternoon near Detroit. “We’d have been out here in the rain.”

Although GM dealers had stocked up on vehicles before the strike and many still have decent supplies, analysts say GM won’t be able to make up for the lost production. Had the strike been shorter, GM could have increased assembly line speeds and worked the plants on overtime to catch up and refill its stock. But many of the plants that make popular SUVs and pickup trucks already were working around the clock to keep up with demand before the strike began.

Also, companies that supply parts to the factories and halted production during the strike will need time to restart, although GM has some parts in stock.

Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of the consulting firm LMC Automotive, estimates that GM has lost production of 300,000 vehicles, and he said maybe only a quarter of it can be made up.

“You can’t add days to the week and you can’t add hours to the day,” he said.

Some production losses will help thin inventory, especially of cars, Schuster said. But in late October and early November, GM will likely run short of colors and models of trucks and SUVs that are in high demand until stocks are replenished, he said. Although truck and SUV buyers generally are loyal to a brand, customers in a hurry for a new vehicle could go elsewhere, Schuster said.

“There are definitely going to be some limitations on choice, and that is a risk,” Schuster said. “Consumers can opt to wait, or they can go down the street to their competitor.”

Now the union will move on to bargain with either Ford or Fiat Chrysler, using the GM deal as a template. A decision on which company is next could come Friday. It’s not clear yet if there will be another strike, but neither Ford nor FCA will be happy about being stuck with the GM terms.

GM traded the ability to close the three factories in Lordstown, Ohio; Warren, Michigan; and near Baltimore for higher labor costs, David Kudla, chief investment strategist for Mainstay Capital Management of Grand Blanc, Michigan, wrote in a note to investors. The contract maintains worker health benefits with low premiums, something that both Ford and FCA wanted to change when negotiations began.

“Ford and FCA didn’t have three factories that they wanted to close, but will have to work around this new framework for higher wages and unchanged health care that the UAW and GM have set,” wrote Kudla, whose firm manages investments for many auto industry workers.

Workers at factories that GM will close have been transferred to plants across the nation, and they campaigned against the deal, which was reached Oct. 16. Workers in Lordstown, for instance, voted 412-61 against it, with 88% of production workers voting “no.”

In the end, economic gains and a $7.7 billion GM investment pledge for U.S. factories were too much to turn down."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is “the most qualified to be president.”

“She has emerged as the clear-cut person to beat,” Soros said of Warren to the New York Times. “I don’t take a public stance, but I do believe that she is the most qualified to be president.”

The 89-year-old mega Democrat donor stopped short of endorsing Warren, stating his remarks should not be received as such.

“I’m not endorsing anybody because I want to work with whoever,” he stated. “I don’t express my views generally because I have to live with whoever the electorate chooses.”

As CNBC notes, Soros’s comments come as investors remain “divided” on Warren, who has proposed a series of tax hikes and frequently criticizes Wall Street.

“I’m fighting for an economy and a government that works for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected. I’m not afraid of anonymous quotes, and wealthy donors don’t get to buy this process. I won’t back down from fighting for the big, structural change we need,” the Massachusetts senator wrote in a recent tweet.

In late June, Soros joined Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, philanthropist Agnes Gund, and 15 others in signing a letter endorsing Democrat presidential contenders to create a wealth tax on them — a move supported by Warren, as well as South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Rep. Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke (D-TX).

“America has a moral, ethical and economic responsibility to tax our wealth more,” the letter, obtained by the Times, read. “A wealth tax could help address the climate crisis, improve the economy, improve health outcomes, fairly create opportunity, and strengthen our democratic freedoms.”

Elizabeth Warren topping the field with 28 percent of the vote and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) slowly regaining his footing.

The poll, taken October 17-21, 2019, among 713 Democrat voters and Democrat-leaning independents, found Warren in the lead with 28 percent support, followed by Biden, who fell seven points behind with 21 percent support.

One of the most significant takeaways from the poll is Sanders’ slow regain, coming in third place with 15 percent support. The last Quinnipiac University Poll, taken prior to the October 15 debate, showed Sanders polling at 11 percent.

The poll also shows Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with a notable boost, coming in fourth place with ten percent support, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) with five percent support. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) garnered three percent support, with the remaining candidates seeing two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.6 percent.

While voters still view Biden as the most viable candidate in a matchup against Trump, that position is slipping.

According to Quinnipiac:

Biden is still viewed as the candidate who has the best chance of winning against Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, but he is not as strong on this question as he once was. In today’s poll, Biden gets 42 percent, but this is down from 48 percent in the October 14 poll and his high of 56 percent in an April 30 poll. Warren comes in second on this electability question with 20 percent, followed by Sanders at 14 percent. Sanders is viewed as the most honest Democratic candidate for president by 28 percent of Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, followed by Biden and Warren who receive 15 percent apiece, and Buttigieg with 11 percent. Sanders and Warren are at the top on the question of which candidate “cares most about people like you,” as Sanders gets 28 percent, Warren receives 24 percent, and Biden gets 14 percent.

The October Quinnipiac University Poll showed Warren with 30 percent to Biden’s 27 percent, indicating that Sanders’ slow regain is affecting the top two candidates in an impactful way.

“Former Vice President Joe Biden slips, Senator Elizabeth Warren steadies, Senator Bernie Sanders gets his groove back, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg breaks back into double digits,” Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow said of the poll’s results.

Warren’s extended lead over Biden and Sanders’ bump follows a CNN poll released this week, showing the former vice president as the clear frontrunner with 34 percent to Warren’s 19 percent and Sanders’ 16 percent."

Harris is struggling to regain the top-tier status she once held early in her campaign. While the presidential hopefuls are vying to win over early primary state voters, a candidate’s support in their respective home state – particularly among those who are currently serving as a lawmaker – can speak volumes.

The California lawmaker is failing to capture support from residents of her home state, falling to fourth place, a Change Research poll shows.

According to the poll, taken for KQED October 15-18, 2019, among 2,605 Democrat voters, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is leading in the Golden State with 28 percent support, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) with 24 percent, and Joe Biden (D) with 19 percent. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who is beginning to surpass Harris in key national and early caucus state polls, came in fourth place with nine percent support, causing Harris to drop to fifth place with eight percent support.

The gap between Warren and Harris has widened by six points over the last month.

“The October survey puts Harris 20 percentage points behind Sen. Warren, compared with a 14 percentage point gap in our September poll,” KQED reports.

Even among women, Harris falls far behind the top tier, earning just seven percent support from female Democrat voters in her state:

By gender, Warren is the top choice of female voters with 31% support, followed by Sanders with 23% and Biden at 21%. Buttigieg and Harris are the choice of 8% and 7% of women respectively. Among men, Sanders edges out Warren 25% to 23% with Biden third at 16%, followed by Buttigieg at 10% and Harris with 9%.

The poll’s margin of error is +/- 2.4 percent.

An Iowa State University poll released Thursday showed Buttigieg surging into second place, behind Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

Buttigieg now has 20 percent support, up seven points from last month and Warren has 28 percent, up four points.

The Iowa State University poll featured 598 likely Democratic Caucus attendees in Iowa from October 18-22 and was conducted online.

A Suffolk University/USA TODAY poll of Iowa Democrats released Monday showed Buttigieg up seven points from an earlier primary survey released in June. The new poll showed Buttigeg was in third place with 13 percent while Biden had 18 percent and Warren had 17 percent. The Suffolk poll featured 500 likely Democratic caucusgoers.

An Emerson poll released last week showed the South Bend mayor at 16 percent, below Warren and Biden with 23 percent each. The Emerson poll featured 317 Democrat caucus voters.

Buttigieg made a conscious effort to paint himself in the fourth presidential debate on CNN as a safer alternative to radical Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and emphasized his willingness to “heal” the nation after defeating President Donald Trump in 2020.

That marked a quiet change from his earlier attempts to gain attention from the left by campaigning as a quiet radical ready to remake the Supreme Court, a proposal that even Ruth Bader-Ginsburg opposed.

Buttigeig also continues to enjoy friendly press coverage from the establishment media, as many pundits and analysts are eager for a safe alternative to Biden and the more leftist candidates.

Seventy-six percent of Democrats described Buttigieg as honest in the ISU poll while only 63 percent said the same about Joe Biden.

The South Bend Mayor also has former Rep. Beto O’Rourke to thank for pushing policies widely out of step with Iowa voters, including mandatory gun confiscation and getting rid of tax-exempt status for churches not willing to embrace gay marriage. Buttigieg pushed back against both proposals, which he argued were politically difficult to achieve.

“[T]he idea that you’re going to strip churches of their tax-exempt status if they haven’t found their way towards blessing same-sex marriage, I’m not sure he understood the implications of what he was saying,” Buttigieg said in response to O’Rourke’s proposal.

O’Rourke is also among the few Democrat rivals that targeted Buttigieg directly for not being radical enough on gun control. But Buttigieg successfully fought back in the fourth debate, telling the former Texas Congressman, “I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.”

O’Rourke is now in 11th place in the Iowa State University poll with only one percent support."

Omar spoke with Hasan and touched on the state of the 2020 presidential race, offering warm words about the “Warren-wing” of the Democrat Party despite endorsing Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).

“What I also believe is that there is a Warren-wing of our party, and I would say that’s most Democrats,” Omar said, referencing Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

“I mean it’s the one thing that everybody accuses us of. We think we’re the smartest in the room. We are very policy-oriented. We care about the details,” she said, suggesting that voters are unable to completely understand what her party is fighting for.

“Just today we were, you know, fighting about a lot of things that most people can’t understand, and there is that aspect of a Warren that is exciting. She has a plan for everything,” she added:

Despite Omar’s seeming praise of Warren, she reiterated that she is pleased by her choice of endorsing Sanders for president.

“Sometimes you have to be reminded about the vision you truly believe in, and where your core values lie,” Omar said.

“And for me, I know that there are people that have to switch some things around, and there are people that are just easy to believe in. And I was reminded that Bernie is one of the people,” she continued.

Another portion of the interview featured Omar choosing between various pairs of candidates. When asked to choose between “Hillary or Tulsi” Omar said, “None!” She gave the same answer when asked to choose between Joe Biden (D) or Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D).

“But if you had to pick one? If one of them is the candidate for your party, who would you rather it be?” Hasan pressed.

“So you’re saying if something tragic happens and they ended up being the nominee?” Omar replied.

Biden confidently proclaimed during an interview with CBS Evening News on Friday he is the Democrat frontrunner and claimed he is not concerned with how much money his competitors have in the bank.

“I know I’m the frontrunner. Find me a national poll with a notable – a couple exceptions. The last four that have come out – but look, this is a marathon,” Biden said. “This is a marathon.”

“You have less than $9 million in the bank. Bernie Sanders has $30 – nearly $34 million in the bank. Sen. Warren has $26 million. How do you compete against that?” CBS anchor Norah O’Donnell asked.

“I just flat beat them,” Biden said, adding that his campaign is on a course to do “extremely well.”

“I’m not worried about being able to fund this campaign,” he continued. ” I really am not, truly.”

His campaign’s actions, however, do not match up with the presidential hopeful’s rhetoric. His campaign on Thursday essentially modified its position on accepting Super PAC support and blamed President Trump for using advertising to “intervene directly” in the Democrat primaries in an effort to take down Biden.

“Let’s be clear: Donald Trump has decided that the general election has already begun,” Biden’s deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, said in a statement.

She continued:

He and his allies are already spending massive amounts of money on paid television and digital advertising to intervene directly in Democratic primaries with the goal of preventing Joe Biden, the opponent that Trump fears most, from becoming the Democratic nominee.

Both Warren and Sanders wasted no time to slam Biden for reversing course.

Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said the Biden campaign is essentially trying to “buy the primary through a super PAC that can rake in unlimited cash from billionaires and corporations.”

Shakir’s campaign statement, via Bern Notice, reads:

Joe Biden has spent his campaign promising elite donors that nothing will fundamentally change for them, and he has made clear to fossil fuel and pharmaceutical donors that he will be their ally. As a result, he has had trouble generating significant grassroots support from Americans who are getting crushed by those same big donors — and so his supporters are suddenly begging for help from super PACs, even though they are vehicles for the kind of corporate corruption that Democrats should be fighting to stop. Let’s be clear: super PACs exist for one reason and one reason only: to help billionaires and corporations bankroll a presidential campaign with unlimited amounts of money, in exchange for favors. Every Democratic candidate should forcefully reject any help from super PACs — and they should tell their supporters and surrogates to stop engaging with super PACs that aim to buy elections and undermine our democracy.

Sanders also criticized Biden during a town hall event in Marshalltown, Iowa, on Thursday.

“I don’t need a super PAC. I am not going to be controlled by a handful of wealthy people. I will be controlled by the working people of this country,” he said.

Similarly, Warren – who has pledged to refrain from attending big fundraisers and courting wealthy donors despite doing so during her senatorial bids and transferring leftover funds to cushion her presidential run – took a shot a Biden on social media but did not call him out by name.

“It’s disappointing that any Democratic candidate would reverse course and endorse the use of unlimited contributions from the wealthy to run against fellow Democrats,” Warren said.

“A handful of wealthy donors should not be allowed to buy the Democratic nomination,” she continued. That’s not who we are.”

“Every Democratic candidate should agree: Super PACs have no place in our primary,” she added:

“I know I’m the frontrunner. Find me a national poll with a notable – a couple exceptions. The last four that have come out – but look, this is a marathon,” Biden responded. “This is a marathon.”

The former vice president maintained the claim even after pushback by O’Donnell, who noted both Warren and Sanders have significantly more money in their campaign coffers.

“I just flat beat them,” Biden said, before adding, “We’re on a course to do extremely well. I’m not worried about being able to fund this campaign. I really am not, truly.”

Contrary to the former vice president’s assertion, most media outlets on both the left and right have deemed him to no longer be the frontrunner. In particular, outlets like Politico and The Washington Post have pointed to polls showing Biden well behind his rivals in the early caucus and primary states.

Since starting this campaign in late-April, Biden has dropped from leading by as much as double digits in states like Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada. A poll released from Iowa this week showed the former vice president in fourth place, trailing not only Sanders and Warren, but also South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

A similar situation has played out nationally, although to less of a degree. In the weeks after Biden first announced his campaign, he led the field by as much as 32 percentage points. In comparison, a Quinnipiac Poll from this week found the former vice president trailing Warren, 21 percent to 28 percent, respectively. A similar Quinnipiac Poll taken just before the most recent Democrat presidential primary, which most pundits agreed was not Biden’s best performance, had seen Warren leading the former vice president more narrowly, 30 percent to 27 percent.

Other national polls from around the same time, found Biden similarly displaced as the frontrunner:

Biden’s squandered lead in the polls has coincided with a drop-off in fundraising. Even though Biden started the race with a strong funding advantage, due to his connections with high-dollar donors, the former vice president ended the most recent fundraising quarter well behind his competitors. In between July and the end of September, Biden only raised $15.2 million. The sum was dwarfed by that raised by Sanders ($25.3 million), Buttigieg ($19.1 million), and Warren ($24.6 million).

Posing more of a problem for the former vice president, however, is that his campaign has spent heavily since announcing in late-April, depleting his total cash on hand to just $9 million at the end of the third quarter. His rivals, on the other hand, still have campaign coffers brimming with cash, especially Sanders who finished the reporting period with more than $33 million on hand.

All of that has led to even Biden’s former Obama administration colleagues, such as David Axelrod, acknowledging he is no longer the frontrunner."

According to the survey, taken October 18-22, 2019, among 598 likely Democratic Caucus attendees, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is leading the pack with 28 percent support – a four-point jump from last month’s results. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) jumped to second place with 20 percent support, marking a seven-point jump for the South Bend mayor. Buttigieg’s spike coincides with the Suffolk University/USA Today poll released Monday, which showed the presidential hopeful rising to third place with 13 percent support among the crowded field of candidates.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) fell to third place, trailing Buttigieg by two points with 18 percent support. Most significantly, perhaps, is Biden’s fourth-place status, garnering just 12 percent support – a four-point drop from September’s results.

The poll shows Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) in a distant fifth place with four percent support, followed by Tom Steyer (D) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) with three percent support each. Harris’s single-digit support follows weeks of pledging to blitz Iowa, telling one colleague that she was going to “f*cking” move there.

According to recent reports from both the New York Times and Washington Post, Clinton has not taken a 2020 run off the table and is, instead, keeping tabs on the growing distress among some members of the Democrat Party, who are unhappy with the current selection of candidates.

“Hillary Clinton, according to two people close to her, has not ruled out jumping in herself, a sign that she is hearing similar dissatisfaction,” the Washington Post reported.

“But put it this way: It ain’t zero. And does she think about it all the time? Absolutely,” a source said, according to the Post.

Billionaire Michael Bloomberg is reportedly conducting himself the same way, telling those close to him that he would consider jumping in the race if Biden falters.

“Bloomberg is in if Biden is out,” a “New York billionaire with ties to Bloomberg,” told CNBC.

While the Times adds that the chances of either jumping in the race are “remote,” it indicates that Democrats close to the potential candidates “believe the only scenario under which they’d consider running is if Mr. Biden drops out or is badly weakened.”

A McLaughlin & Associates October 2019 poll released this week examined that scenario, taking Biden out of the equation and putting both Clinton and Bloomberg in the race.

While Bloomberg’s presence does not appear to make a significant impact, Biden’s absence and Clinton’s addition would cause Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to rise to the top of the national field with 23 percent support. Under the scenario, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) would maintain her top tier status with 20 percent support, followed by Clinton with ten percent support. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) would also gain a notable boost, coming right behind Clinton with nine percent support.

Andrew Yang (D) would also enjoy a bump, jumping to six percent, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with five percent support, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with four percent support, and Beto O’Rourke (D) with three percent support. The remaining candidates would garner two percent support or less. That includes Bloomberg, who would only see one percent support:

The move comes as Biden’s campaign struggles to keep up in fundraising in comparison to candidates like South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (D-VT).

Although the former vice president started his campaign with a strong funding advantage, thanks in part to high-dollar donors, he ended the most recent fundraising period well behind his competitors. In particular, Biden only raised $15.2 million in the third quarter of this year, far below the sums brought in by Sanders ($25.3 million), Buttigieg ($19.1 million), and Warren ($24.6 million).

Posing more of a problem for the former vice president, however, is that his campaign has spent heavily since announcing in late-April, depleting his total cash on hand to just $9 million at the end of the third quarter. His rivals, on the other hand, still have campaign coffers brimming with cash, especially Sanders who finished the reporting period with more than $33 million on hand.

Biden’s cash crunch results from his inability to make in-roads with small-dollar donors. Unlike Warren or Sanders, more than 2,800 donors have already maxed out to Biden’s campaign since his announcement in late April, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In fact, top-dollar donors make up a far higher percentage of Biden’s campaign’s coffers than those of his competitors.

In comparison, only 38 percent of the campaign’s funds to date have come from individuals donating less than $200. Such a ratio poses an issue for the former vice president, especially now that his top contributors are prohibited by law from donating again until after he’s secured the nomination. David Kochel, the former chief strategist for Jeb Bush’s failed 2016 presidential bid, explained the problem to Politico this month.

“If you don’t have that perpetual, low-dollar fundraising machine, you can’t compete,” Kochel said. “Biden looks like he can’t compete with Warren, Bernie and Buttigieg. How’s he going to compete with Trump?”

As evidenced by its decision on Thursday, the campaign appears to have decided his best way forward is to rely on super PACs, which are allowed to raise and spend unlimited funds. Such groups are increasingly being scorned on the left — including Biden just a few short months ago.

When first announcing his campaign, the former vice president pledged not to accept any campaign donations from corporate PACs or federal lobbyists. Part of that pledge was also his assurance not accept money from super PACs, even going as far to discourage one that had already formed on his behalf.

“Vice President Biden does not welcome assistance from super PACs,” a campaign aide told the Huffington Post in April when asked about the PAC.

As part of its reasoning for rejecting the help, the Biden campaign pointed to the former vice president’s long record of championing campaign finance reform. The candidate, himself, elaborated on his position during an interview with PBS News Hour last year while discussing campaign finance advice he purportedly gave to Sanders in 2016.

“I’m the guy that told him, you shouldn’t accept any money from a super PAC, because people can’t possibly trust you,” Biden said at the time. “How will a middle-class guy accept you if you accept money?”"

For the third quarter, “we discovered, and took steps to remediate bugs that primarily affected our legacy Mobile Application Promotion (MAP) product, impacting our ability to target ads and share data with measurement and ad partners,” Twitter said in its letter to shareholders.

“We also experienced greater-than-expected seasonality in our advertising business that began in July and continued into August.”

Twitter said these issues negatively impacted year-over-year revenue growth for the period.

Advertising revenue hit $702 million for the third quarter, which was up from the same period last year, but also failed to match analyst expectations.

Twitter also published fourth-quarter guidance that fell short of expectations. The company is forecasting total revenue to be between $940 million and $1.01 billion for the period, which is below the $1.06 billion that Wall Street is expecting.

In recent weeks, Twitter has found itself in the middle of a Democratic skirmish over whether President Donald Trump should be banned from the platform.

Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) has called on Twitter to give President Trump the boot, claiming that he incites “fear” and that he made comments about the so-called White House “whistleblower.”

But rival candidates Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) have both said President Trump should be allowed to remain on Twitter.

The debate, which is being sponsored by The Washington Post and MSNBC in Georgia on Nov. 20, will be moderated by NBC News’s Andrea Mitchel and Kristen Welker, The Washington Post’s Ashley Parker, and MSNBC host Rachel Maddow.

As the Post reported when announcing the lineup, the November debate will mark the second time in history that an all-female panel has moderated such an event. It is unclear, however, if the gender of the moderators will be enough to allay doubts and concerns about the neutrality of the DNC and the NBC networks.

Even prior to the moderator lineup, progressive activists had questioned if it is improper for MSNBC to sponsor the event given that executives of its parent corporation, Comcast Corp., have donated heavily to candidates likely to be on the debate stage. In particular, Comcast executives have overwhelmingly showered two of the more moderate Democrats running, former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, with campaign donations. Executives have donated more than $77,000 to Buttigieg and nearly $75,000 to Biden since the start of the 2020 cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

No such donations were made to the presidential campaigns of Sens. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) or Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who poll higher than Buttigieg nationally and outpace Biden in several of the early primary states.

Apart from the potential bias on the part of MSNBC and Comcast, progressive activists and even lower-tiered presidential candidates have questioned the DNC qualifications standards for the debate. Since the DNC first announced it would be limiting participation in the debates, the organization has consistently tightened requirements in hopes of winnowing the field. The tactic, though, has only led to accusations that the DNC is “penalizing” lesser known candidates to the benefit of those that are more established, like Biden.

For the upcoming debate, the DNC is requiring candidates reach at least three percent in four state or national polls or five percent in two state polls. For those unable to meet that goal in the 19-person field, candidates can also qualify by receiving 165,000 “unique donations,” from at least 600 “unique donors” in 20 states.

To date, only eight candidate have met these qualification standards for the November debate.

Complicating matters for the DNC is that viewership for its last four presidential primary debates has fallen off significantly. October’s debate, which was hosted by CNN in Ohio, only drew an estimated 8.3 million views, much lower than the 9.7 million that tuned in for the second primary debate in July."

Bill Weld (R-MA), is a Joe Biden supporter.

Weld appeared at the CITIZEN by CNN conference on Thursday with former governor and congressman Mark Sanford (R-SC) and former congressman Joe Walsh (R-IL). And as if to prove CNN is all about fake news even when it comes to the little things, the trio were featured in a panel titled “The Contenders,” which is a laughably false way to describe three losers who have less than no chance of beating President Trump for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination.

A more accurate title for the panel would have been “The Failures,” but that would have confused the audience into thinking that was the panel featuring CNN chief Jeff Zucker being questioned by his sycophantic Not-So-Mini-Me Brian Stelter.

Anyway, the most illuminating moment during Weld and company’s panel was when Weld blurted out that HELL YES he supports former Vice President Joe Biden for president.

“Could I vote for a Democrat? Hell yes. If it’s Trump against Joe Biden, I’m with Biden in a heartbeat,” Weld admitted.

Weld even said that with a few tweaks to her platform, he could vote for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

The most revealing part of this is that, of the three, Weld is the most accomplished and least crazy. Both Sanford and Walsh were recently booted out of congress by voters (Sanford in the primary).

What’s more, while serving as South Carolina’s governor, Sanford disgraced himself in 2009 after he disappeared for a number of days with the claim he had been out hiking the Appalachian Trail. The truth is that the married governor was sharing a bed with his mistress in Argentina.

Walsh served exactly one term in congress before losing his re-election bid, has said more racist things than even Joe Biden, and has so far raised only a little more money for his 2020 presidential campaign than the amount of money his ex-wife sued him over for unpaid child support ($117,000).

The 74-year-old Weld does at least have a distinguished record as a U.S attorney and two gubernatorial wins in Massachusetts. But then in July of 1997, he kind of flaked out halfway through his second term by abruptly resigning to become Bill Clinton’s ambassador to Mexico — except he never made it. Six weeks later he withdrew his name.

So this is all Never Trump can come up with: a racist, a guy who abandoned his political post and wife to have a fling in Argentina, and a guy who enthusiastically supports Joe Biden, a Democrat who supports post-birth abortion, allowing biological men to serve their time in women’s prisons, gun confiscation, another round of Obamacare, opening up the southern border, and reversing the Trump tax cuts.

So much for all those First Principles the vile grifters in the Never Trump crowd say they stand behind…

On August 15, 2019, Breitbart News reported Warren’s promise of “executive action in every corner” for gun control, should she be elected.

On October 2, 2019, Breitbart News reported Warren’s push for a federal limit on the number of guns an American can purchase. She admitted that limited gun purchases will not solve gun violence by itself, suggesting it is “not a one and done” issue, but a very broad issue requiring numerous laws, regulations, changes.

On October 15, 2019, Breitbart News reported Warren’s plan to use excise taxes to reduce firearm and ammunition sales. The plan to use excise taxes was published by Medium where readers saw Warren’s belief that the current ten percent excise tax on firearms is too low. She made clear she wants to raise that tax to 30 percent while increasing the tax on ammunition to 50 percent.

This would immediately raise the price of a $500 gun to $650 and would increase the price of a $20 box of ammo to $30. Such taxation could render the Second Amendment cost-prohibitive for the poor.

Warren's 'Medicare for All' proposal will test her brand,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/26/politics/elizabeth-warren-medicare-for-all-plan-questions/index.html,"Her centrist primary rivals say that's a few months too late.

For now, though, the Democratic presidential field has been left to wait, and speculate, on what Warren's forthcoming plan to pay for ""Medicare for All"" will look like.

But the arrival of the most hotly anticipated policy document in recent political memory will only mark the beginning of a new chapter in the long progressive push for a federal single-payer health care system -- and this increasingly testy nominating contest.

The debate over Medicare for All, which Sen. Bernie Sanders pushed into the mainstream during his first presidential campaign, has mushroomed into a broader test during the 2020 primary. Sen. Kamala Harris , like Warren a co-sponsor of the legislation Sanders introduced in 2017 and 2019, wavered under pressure early on in the campaign and ultimately dropped her support in favor of a less ambitious -- and expensive -- plan, which she rolled out over the summer.

Warren took a different route from her Senate colleague, doubling down on the bill and famously declaring in June at the first primary debate, ""I'm with Bernie on Medicare for all."" Four months on, Warren is among the frontrunners for the party's nomination and, with the target on her back growing by the day, has come under intense scrutiny for failing to give a simple answer to a complicated question: ""How will you pay for it?""

Her campaign's formal response, which is expected to land some time before the next debate, is unlikely to spare Warren much criticism from her political rivals. The centrists, now headed up by her most vocal critic, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, are a good bet to remain focused on the increased spending required to make any major expansion work.

And the left, even if Sanders himself is unlikely to directly attack Warren, will pick through her plan for any sign of backtracking on that memorable commitment.

To date, Warren has responded to questions about middle class taxes by scrupulously avoiding the word itself, repeatedly guaranteeing only that overall ""costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down,"" while pledging not to ""not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.""

Warren has offered little insight into how her campaign is going about the process of drawing up its financing plan, and though outside economists have told reporters they are being consulted, their actual influence remains unknown.

Meanwhile, progressive lawmakers and policy wonks, some of whom have been turning this same Rubik's Cube for decades, are jockeying to shape the parameters of the next round of debate -- the one that will decide whether Warren's blueprint is viewed as mathematically sound and politically feasible.

There is an irony in Warren's conundrum.

Sanders, as he like to remind voters, ""wrote the damn bill."" But he has never offered a definitive cost estimate or locked himself into a matching ""pay-for"" plan, instead positing a menu of potential options -- like having employees pay a new 4% tax and employers a levy of 7.5%.

Think tanks across the ideological spectrum have filled the gap, meaning Warren not only has to decide on how to raise revenue for Medicare for All, but -- if she hasn't already -- choose from a range of cost estimates.

When asked about that on Monday, Warren stuck to her argument that Medicare for All represented the ""cheapest way to make sure that everyone gets covered."" When pressed on the particulars, she promised for the second time in 24 hours to deliver a plan in the coming weeks.

""The estimates on the cost of Medicare vary by trillions and trillions of dollars. And the different revenue streams for how to pay for it are many,"" Warren told reporters in Des Moines, Iowa.

By picking a lower end figure -- they range from around $14 to $34 trillion -- Warren could potentially argue that by shifting the new tax burden to employers, along with the richest corporations and individuals, she can make the numbers work without directly tapping the middle class. By most calculations, though, that might still not be enough to guarantee everything in the Sanders bill.

Whatever route Warren takes, the details her campaign publicizes are likely to live on well after the primary is over, no matter who wins the presidency in 2020. For now, though, her decision -- and how it is perceived by voters -- could affect her candidacy in conversations that run wider and deeper than the health care debate.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, right up there with or slightly ahead of Warren in most recent polling, has sought to cast Warren -- with the timing of her Medicare for All announcement as evidence -- as dissembling, unprepared, or both.

""It's mystifying that for someone who has put having a plan for everything at the center of her pitch to voters, Sen. Warren has decided to release a health care plan only after enduring immense public pressure for refusing to do so,"" a Biden campaign spokesman said late Sunday, shortly after Warren first teased the plan.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who has also launched a series of sharp salvos at Warren, struck a similar tone when she suggested, on the debate stage last week, that her colleague's refusal to deliver a plainly-worded answer to the tax question is symptomatic of some core mendacity.

""At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,"" Klobuchar said on the debate stage. ""And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice.""

And Buttigieg, when asked at a rally in Nevada this week if taxes would go up to pay for his public option plan, which he calls ""Medicare for all who want it,"" began with yet another shot at Warren.

""Good question, because not everyone has been answering this question,"" he said, before talking about his plans to undo President Donald Trump's corporate tax cuts and pointing to the savings that would come with allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices.

There has been, however, growing pushback in Democratic circles to the cost narrative that Warren's opponents, both in the primary and the party's policy trenches, are seeking to exploit.

Writing in USA Today earlier this week, Donald Berwick, who served as administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the Obama administration, sought to turn the tables on Medicare for All's most vocal critics.

""Some candidates have attempted to sidestep the cost debate by promising to spend less and accomplish the same goals,"" Berwick wrote, without naming Buttigieg, Biden or anyone else by name. ""These proposals, such as relying on a public option or expanding Medicare Advantage, offering private plans within Medicare, provide too few details to allow real cost comparisons. But it is unlikely they will do as much as Medicare for All would to reduce national health care spending or reduce costs for families.""

Still, the reality for Warren is that her rise in the polls, coupled with the always explosive politics surrounding health care, means that her next move -- and plan -- is just as likely to boost her further as undermine the brand she's spent so long building."

Katie Porter of California, a first-term lawmaker who has gained wide notice for her forceful grilling of corporate executives in congressional hearings, plans to endorse Sen. Elizabeth Warren for president, two people familiar with the decision told CNN.

Porter, who captured a historically Republican district in 2018, is one of the highest-profile members of the freshman class, and just this week she conducted a scathing interrogation of Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, on Capitol Hill.

Her expected endorsement is a coup for Warren, whose rise in the polls has not yet been matched by support from Democratic elected officials. It would also be a blow to Porter's fellow Californian, Sen. Kamala Harris, who has been counting on her home state's primary to help her mount a comeback in the race.

Spokespeople for Warren and Porter declined to comment.

Both Warren and Harris are personally close with Porter, and both senators endorsed her in a competitive primary election last year. Porter is a former student of Warren's at Harvard Law School and, like Warren, is an expert on bankruptcy law. Porter worked closely with Harris when the senator was the attorney general of California, helping oversee a major legal settlement between the state and mortgage lenders.

The president is receiving the “Bipartisan Justice Award” Friday in Columbia, South Carolina, from “the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center, a group founded by twenty black Republicans and twenty black Democrats in 2015,” the Daily Caller reported.

The award is being presented at the 2019 Second Step Presidential Justice Forum, which is being held at Benedict College, one of roughly 100 historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in the U.S. The annual distinction recognizes a public servant who works with members of the other party to achieve criminal justice reform.

The Daily Caller adds that nearly every Democratic presidential candidate is scheduled to attend the gathering at some point this weekend:

The following Democrats are set to attend the forum: Maryland Rep. John Delaney, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former HUD Secretary Julian Castro, and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard as well as Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

(Not listed was former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX), whose campaign ejected this reporter from an event at Benedict in August.)

Trump signed the First Step Act last year, providing opportunities for certain federal prisoners to reduce their sentences by committing to more intensive rehabilitation programs, including job and skills training.

Some conservatives were skeptical of the legislation, but Trump earned bipartisan praise from within the black community.

Democratic candidates have tended to ignore the new law in making pledges for new criminal justice reforms, as if unwilling to acknowledge Trump’s success.

They will have trouble avoiding it this weekend.

Though Soros has often pushed for free trade, he told the Times that China had not played by the rules and that its values were at odds with those of the “open society” to which he had devoted his political life:

“I consider Xi Jinping’s China the worst threat to an open society,” he said of China’s president, repeating a declaration he made this year in Davos, Switzerland, that prompted China to retort, “We hope the relevant American can correct his attitude.” Mr. Soros, who has long encouraged free trade as a strategy to open up otherwise closed countries, said that the strategy had not worked in China the way he had expected and that more intervention was needed. Mr. Soros, pointing a finger in the air, called China “a mortal enemy” and said the West gave it too much of the benefit of the doubt. “We should recognize it: It’s a different system. It’s totally opposed to ours, diametrically opposed to ours,” he said. Perhaps to qualify his words, he added: “I’m not anti-Chinese at all. I’m just anti Xi Jinping.”

Soros’s words echo an op-ed he published in the Wall Street Journal last month in which he praised President Donald Trump’s policy of confronting China as a “great achievement.”

Though Soros told the Times that he expected the political pendulum to swing back to “globalists” (his word), and said he expected Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to be the Democratic Party nominee (without endorsing her), his feelings on China are firmly in line with those of the Trump administration.

Lindsey Graham endorsed the Green New Deal. The ad came after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez grilled Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg earlier this week about the company's policy of allowing politicians to run ads on the platform that are false.

""Would I be able to run advertisements on Facebook targeting Republicans in primaries saying they voted for the Green New Deal,"" Rep. Ocasio-Cortez asked Zuckerberg at a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Wednesday. Adding, ""I mean if you're not fact-checking political advertisements, I'm just trying to understand the bounds here, what's fair game?""

On Thursday, a PAC named ""The Really Online Lefty League"" posted a false ad that used edited video to make it appear like Graham had endorsed the Green New Deal.

The ad spliced together different audio of Graham speaking to make it sound like he said, ""Simply put, we believe in the Green New Deal."" Graham never said that.

The Amazon chief had an estimated total net worth of $111 billion as of Thursday’s close of trading, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which updates its list of the wealthiest people in the world on a daily basis.

If Amazon shares continue to fall Friday, Bezos could lose his No. 1 spot to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, whose net worth is pegged at $107 billion. Bloomberg estimated that Gates overtook Bezos in early trading Friday, as Amazon shares were down as much as 4 percent, though the stock has recovered some of its losses.

Forbes estimated that Bezos actually fell to the No. 2 spot late Thursday, when Amazon shares dipped 7 percent in after-hours trading.

But his decline wasn’t completely the result of Amazon’s share price, according to Forbes. Bezos recently transferred a quarter of his Amazon stake to his ex-wife, MacKenzie, as part of their highly publicized divorce.

Amazon disappointed Wall Street on Thursday when it reported its first decline in profits in about two years, with net income dropping 26 percent. The news sent Amazon shares plummeting 9 percent in after-hours trading.

In addition to running Amazon, Bezos’ empire also includes the Washington Post.

Other high-ranking U.S. billionaires on Bloomberg’s list include Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett at No. 4 and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg at No. 5.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

On Friday, the United Auto Workers voted to ratify its agreement with General Motors, bringing the nearly five-week-long strike to an end. Although it won some short-term pay increases and job protections for workers, the union failed to get GM to reopen the Lordstown, Ohio assembly plant and transmission plants in Warren, Michigan and Baltimore, Maryland. The union's inability to win big concessions from GM -- even after a prolonged strike -- shouldn't come as that big of a surprise. They were likely never possible in the first place.

In order to win substantial concessions, a union needs to bargain against a firm that has substantial market power and profits. This was GM in the 1950s and '60s, when the company by itself controlled nearly half of the US auto market. The GM of today is different.

It has continued to fall ever since. Despite its $11.8 billion profits in 2018, GM continues to have severe vulnerabilities. GM's 2018 market share is 16.6%, down from 23.2% in 2007, the last year before the Great Recession. By the time GM entered bankruptcy in 2009, it was already losing ground and its market share was down to nearly 19%.Ithas continued to fall ever since.

The company's loss of market share post-bankruptcy has left it with substantial excess production capacity and the fixed costs associated with maintaining those underutilized plants. This explains why the company was unwilling to budge on plant closures, such as the one in Lordstown

rose nationwide from 6.8 million to 17.7 million over that period. But the vast majority of growth in the US auto market over the last 50-plus years benefited foreign automakers like Toyota, Honda and Nissan. Thus, GM finds itself in a weakened state compared to the heyday of the 1960s, when unions could use prolonged strikes to win generous concessions from the automaker. More disconcerting is that GM sold fewer cars in 2018 than it did in 1961, despite the US working age population rising by 103 million people over that time. Total vehicle salesrose nationwide from 6.8 million to 17.7 million over that period.

In past recessions, fast-growing emerging markets have helped bail out the global economy. But there's one thing standing in the way of history repeating itself this time: the strong US dollar.

As global growth slows and the United States' economy shows signs of weakness , investors are looking for places where their money will grow.

Emerging markets, such as South Korea, Brazil or India, are riskier to invest in but often grow faster than developed nations like Germany or the US. They also tend to be export-driven and often tied to commodity price moves.

In the recession following the financial crisis, China provided a boost for the global economy, growing nearly 9% on the back of strong domestic spending . ""Without China, global growth would have been negative in 2009,"" said Bank of America strategist David Hauner in a note.

But circumstances have changed in the past decade. China probably won't be the knight in shining armor this time. The country's economy is slowing too and it is more highly leveraged than it was a decade ago.

It will be hard for other emerging markets to step in and help avoid a global recession as long as the US dollar remains strong: Emerging economies tend to borrow in dollars. These countries are uniquely vulnerable to a strong greenback, which can make their debts more expensive.

A weaker US currency could alleviate that strain and allow emerging markets to grow faster, perhaps keeping the world out of a global growth recession . The Federal Reserve is gradually lowering rates, which could help to weaken the greenback. But it hasn't exactly been moving with any urgency so far -- certainly not as quickly as US President Donald Trump would like.

""Emerging markets can help to 'save the world' in this downturn, but this requires a weaker US dollar and thus a much more dovish Fed,"" said Hauner.

Developed countries like the United States and its European peers are also increasingly worried that their ultra-low interest rate policies aren't actually stimulating any growth. Japan has been the prime example of that, and investors are now talking about the Japanification of Europe. The US economy is expanding at a faster pace than its rivals, but growth is still slowing.

The Federal Reserve is meeting next week, and the chances of another quarter percentage point interest rate cut are over 90%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Whether this will be enough to knock the dollar remains to be seen. Currencies commonly weaken during periods of looser monetary policy.

Complaints about the strength of America's currency have mounted this year. From Trump to Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren , critics say the strong buck makes US goods less competitive on the global market.

The often-cited ICE US Dollar Index, which measures the currency against six rivals, is actually only up 1.6% this year. But a look at specific emerging currencies shows a different picture.

The dollar is up 1.9% against India's rupee, 4.1% against Brazil's real, and 5.5% against the South Korean won since the start of the year -- to a large extent because of the trade war.

Making matters worse, emerging economies borrow mostly in dollars, while their biggest customers mostly pay in euros, Hauner said. So these countries are also uniquely exposed to the euro-dollar exchange rate. This year, the shared European currency has fallen 3.2% against the greenback."

Striking General Motors factory workers will put down their picket signs after approving a new contract that will end a 40-day strike that paralyzed the company’s U.S. production.

The United Auto Workers union said in a statement Friday that workers had approved the new four-year deal. But no vote totals were given. The union says it will announce shortly whether it will bargain next with Ford or Fiat Chrysler.

Picket lines were to come down immediately, and skilled trades workers will begin restarting factories that were shuttered when 49,000 workers walked out on Sept. 16. Some production workers could return as early as Friday night.

The deal includes a mix of wage increases and lump-sum payments and an $11,000 signing bonus. But GM will close three U.S. factories that make slow-selling cars and transmissions. Analysts estimate the strike cost GM more than $2 billion.

The five-week walkout was big enough to help push down September U.S. durable goods orders by 1.1%, the largest drop in four months.

Trades workers such as machinists and electricians likely will enter the plants quickly, restarting boilers and preparing paint shops, robots and other equipment to restart production.

On the picket line at a transmission plant in Romulus, Michigan, worker Tricia Pruitt said the wage gains were worth staying off the job for more than five weeks, but she’s ready to return to work.

Pruitt, a 15-year GM employee, was happy that the contract brings workers hired after 2007 up to the same wage as older workers in four years.

She’ll be glad not to be on the picket line if the strike ends. “Look at us now. We’re in coats,” she said on a gray, chilly Friday afternoon near Detroit. “We’d have been out here in the rain.”

Although GM dealers had stocked up on vehicles before the strike and many still have decent supplies, analysts say GM won’t be able to make up for the lost production. Had the strike been shorter, GM could have increased assembly line speeds and worked the plants on overtime to catch up and refill its stock. But many of the plants that make popular SUVs and pickup trucks already were working around the clock to keep up with demand before the strike began.

Also, companies that supply parts to the factories and halted production during the strike will need time to restart, although GM has some parts in stock.

Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of the consulting firm LMC Automotive, estimates that GM has lost production of 300,000 vehicles, and he said maybe only a quarter of it can be made up.

“You can’t add days to the week and you can’t add hours to the day,” he said.

Some production losses will help thin inventory, especially of cars, Schuster said. But in late October and early November, GM will likely run short of colors and models of trucks and SUVs that are in high demand until stocks are replenished, he said. Although truck and SUV buyers generally are loyal to a brand, customers in a hurry for a new vehicle could go elsewhere, Schuster said.

“There are definitely going to be some limitations on choice, and that is a risk,” Schuster said. “Consumers can opt to wait, or they can go down the street to their competitor.”

Now the union will move on to bargain with either Ford or Fiat Chrysler, using the GM deal as a template. A decision on which company is next could come Friday. It’s not clear yet if there will be another strike, but neither Ford nor FCA will be happy about being stuck with the GM terms.

GM traded the ability to close the three factories in Lordstown, Ohio; Warren, Michigan; and near Baltimore for higher labor costs, David Kudla, chief investment strategist for Mainstay Capital Management of Grand Blanc, Michigan, wrote in a note to investors. The contract maintains worker health benefits with low premiums, something that both Ford and FCA wanted to change when negotiations began.

“Ford and FCA didn’t have three factories that they wanted to close, but will have to work around this new framework for higher wages and unchanged health care that the UAW and GM have set,” wrote Kudla, whose firm manages investments for many auto industry workers.

Workers at factories that GM will close have been transferred to plants across the nation, and they campaigned against the deal, which was reached Oct. 16. Workers in Lordstown, for instance, voted 412-61 against it, with 88% of production workers voting “no.”

In the end, economic gains and a $7.7 billion GM investment pledge for U.S. factories were too much to turn down."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is “the most qualified to be president.”

“She has emerged as the clear-cut person to beat,” Soros said of Warren to the New York Times. “I don’t take a public stance, but I do believe that she is the most qualified to be president.”

The 89-year-old mega Democrat donor stopped short of endorsing Warren, stating his remarks should not be received as such.

“I’m not endorsing anybody because I want to work with whoever,” he stated. “I don’t express my views generally because I have to live with whoever the electorate chooses.”

As CNBC notes, Soros’s comments come as investors remain “divided” on Warren, who has proposed a series of tax hikes and frequently criticizes Wall Street.

“I’m fighting for an economy and a government that works for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected. I’m not afraid of anonymous quotes, and wealthy donors don’t get to buy this process. I won’t back down from fighting for the big, structural change we need,” the Massachusetts senator wrote in a recent tweet.

In late June, Soros joined Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, philanthropist Agnes Gund, and 15 others in signing a letter endorsing Democrat presidential contenders to create a wealth tax on them — a move supported by Warren, as well as South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Rep. Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke (D-TX).

“America has a moral, ethical and economic responsibility to tax our wealth more,” the letter, obtained by the Times, read. “A wealth tax could help address the climate crisis, improve the economy, improve health outcomes, fairly create opportunity, and strengthen our democratic freedoms.”

Warren has seen her campaign climb to second place in recent weeks, putting her in striking distance of frontrunner former Vice President Joe Biden, according to national polls."

An Iowa State University poll released Thursday showed Buttigieg surging into second place, behind Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

Buttigieg now has 20 percent support, up seven points from last month and Warren has 28 percent, up four points.

The Iowa State University poll featured 598 likely Democratic Caucus attendees in Iowa from October 18-22 and was conducted online.

A Suffolk University/USA TODAY poll of Iowa Democrats released Monday showed Buttigieg up seven points from an earlier primary survey released in June. The new poll showed Buttigeg was in third place with 13 percent while Biden had 18 percent and Warren had 17 percent. The Suffolk poll featured 500 likely Democratic caucusgoers.

An Emerson poll released last week showed the South Bend mayor at 16 percent, below Warren and Biden with 23 percent each. The Emerson poll featured 317 Democrat caucus voters.

Buttigieg made a conscious effort to paint himself in the fourth presidential debate on CNN as a safer alternative to radical Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and emphasized his willingness to “heal” the nation after defeating President Donald Trump in 2020.

That marked a quiet change from his earlier attempts to gain attention from the left by campaigning as a quiet radical ready to remake the Supreme Court, a proposal that even Ruth Bader-Ginsburg opposed.

Buttigeig also continues to enjoy friendly press coverage from the establishment media, as many pundits and analysts are eager for a safe alternative to Biden and the more leftist candidates.

Seventy-six percent of Democrats described Buttigieg as honest in the ISU poll while only 63 percent said the same about Joe Biden.

The South Bend Mayor also has former Rep. Beto O’Rourke to thank for pushing policies widely out of step with Iowa voters, including mandatory gun confiscation and getting rid of tax-exempt status for churches not willing to embrace gay marriage. Buttigieg pushed back against both proposals, which he argued were politically difficult to achieve.

“[T]he idea that you’re going to strip churches of their tax-exempt status if they haven’t found their way towards blessing same-sex marriage, I’m not sure he understood the implications of what he was saying,” Buttigieg said in response to O’Rourke’s proposal.

O’Rourke is also among the few Democrat rivals that targeted Buttigieg directly for not being radical enough on gun control. But Buttigieg successfully fought back in the fourth debate, telling the former Texas Congressman, “I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.”

O’Rourke is now in 11th place in the Iowa State University poll with only one percent support."

Maher began by saying that elections in the U.S. are a binary choice, and “The question Democrats must ask themselves is, what would make a voter say, Trump’s right. I don’t like him, but I have no choice? Well, let’s go down the list: Bernie Sanders says we should let the Boston Marathon bomber vote. Why? Is there a great clamoring to give deranged serial killers more of a voice in civil society? … Now, I’m sure you can make an argument for this, but we’re trying to win an election here, and this just feeds into what Trump is selling.”

He continued, “Elizabeth Warren has not come out in favor of imprisoned serial killers voting, but she does want taxpayers to cover their sex-change operations in prison. Which brings up the question, if you tried, could you come up with a policy with more third rail buzzwords in it? … And again, where are the votes in this?”

Maher added, “So, let’s imagine a slightly different scenario, you’re a progressive voter who likes Elizabeth Warren. You drive a Prius, hate guns, and buy kale in bulk, but you find out that Warren does not support taxpayer-funded gender reassignment surgery for convicts. So, that’s it? Dealbreaker? You’re voting for Trump now? Of course not. This is the binary thing Democrats don’t get … They’ve got nowhere else to go. So, you can stop wearing your most divisive issues on your sleeve.”

And maybe, if one of them wins next year, they will, in fact, nick the rich a little—but don’t count on it.

After all, the last two Democrat presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, also campaigned on raising taxes on the wealthy, and yet during their time in office, the effective tax rate on top earners actually fell.

Still, the left likes to say that its goal is to “comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.” And yet maybe that’s just a campaign routine. Maybe sometimes the truth is closer to, afflict the afflicted, and comfort the comfortable.

How so? Well, one way of making the comfortable even more comfortable is by legalizing prostitution. That way, for those so inclined, the man—or woman—who has everything can have even more of everything, with no fear of the prudish police.

A case in point is Elizabeth Warren, whom the betting markets consider to be the Democrat most likely to win the 2020 nomination. On October 10, Warren tweeted some news sure to cheer rich johns—and, of course, poor- and middle-income johns, too: “I am open to decriminalizing sex work. Sex workers, like all workers, deserve autonomy and are particularly vulnerable to physical and financial abuse.”

We might translate some of this jargon-y code into simple English: “Sex work” is the politically correct way of saying prostitution, while “decriminalizing” really means legalizing, and “open to” means I’m in favor of it, but, I just can’t say so before the election.

So yes, legalizing prostitution is a part of Warren’s agenda. Indeed, at least four other Democrat presidential hopefuls—Cory Booker, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, and Bernie Sanders—have also declared their support, to some degree or another, for sex-worker “decriminalization.”

Indeed, such decriminalization is on the Democrats’ to-do list in, of all places, the nation’s capital. Here’s a Washington Post headline from October 18: “D.C. leaders hear from public over proposal to decriminalize sex work.” As the article detailed, the Washington, DC, City Council will be voting on the matter in November.

Fortunately, passage of the measure is far from assured; in fact, opponents are vocal and articulate. One opponent, Toni Van Pelt, president of the National Organization for Women, was blunt about what would happen if the bill passes: “Because this demand [for paid sex] cannot be met locally, traffickers will bring prostituted women and girls from other jurisdictions.” And so, Van Pelt continued, “D.C., the capital of our nation, would undoubtedly become a sex tourism destination.”

In the words of another opponent, Yasmin Vafa, executive director of Rights4Girls, “This bill is a sex trafficker’s dream.”

Covering the same story, the New York Times added:

All sides agree that prostitution practiced openly would reverberate well beyond the city’s thriving but shadowy sex industry of street prostitution, massage parlors, strip clubs and high-end call girls. Prostitutes would most likely work openly out of homes in neighborhoods across the city. Certain blocks could become de facto red-light districts.

In other words, D.C. wouldn’t just be the swamp, it would be the sex swamp. Yes, the reader can add any joke he or she might wish about politicians and/or lobbyists having new competition for whoredom, and yet still, it’s not amusing to think that the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial would be joined by the Hooker Hotel.

Yet we can further add a class dimension to the matter. That is, legal prostitution streamlines the process by which the rich buy—or at least rent—the bodies of the non-rich. Not every rich person is a customer, of course; plenty of fat cats are happily, and loyally, married. And yet it’s also true that the rich tend to spend more money on everything.

Let’s ask ourselves: Who has the most money to spend on prostitutes? Who can bid the highest price for flesh? So we see more clearly that the rich have the most to gain from legalizing sex work.

A case in point is Bob Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots football team.

We all remember Kraft and his brush with the vice squad; back in February, the “masseuse” who allegedly serviced him was busted on a prostitution rap. As for Kraft himself, he had better lawyers, of course, and so he wasn’t arrested. Indeed, his pricy attorneys are battling with prosecutors as of this writing; back in May, they persuaded a judge to toss out the video evidence, and so there’s no way to know how Kraft’s case will ultimately be adjudicated.

We just know this much: The optics have been horrible for Kraft. He would have been a lot happier if he could have just gone in and out, with no pesky police paying attention.

Of course, prostitution is not just for billionaires; it’s for any horndog with excess cash. And when it comes to disposable income, Democrats are way ahead. In fact, the ten richest congressional districts in the U.S. are represented by Democrats, as are 41 of the richest 50 districts. So with President Warren—or with any of the other pro-decriminalization Democrats–in the White House it seems likely that the laissez-faire approach to sex will become federal policy. And as we know, laissez-faire always works best for the rich.

Thus naughty Democrats, even non-plutocrats, would have a new category of pleasure on which to spend their money, legally.

To be sure, a pro-prostitution Department of Justice might not be able to override state and local laws (although, of course, we should never underestimate the power of liberal lawyers, working with liberal judges and the American Civil Liberties Union to think of tricky end-runs around traditional morality).

In any case, without a doubt, a Warren-ized DOJ would take some of the pressure off interstate and international and sex-trafficking. And that’s good news for Bob Kraft-types, both in America and coming from around the world.

Moreover, such a hands-off approach would be even better news for the next Jeffrey Epstein. We can recall that the late (we presume) Epstein had an international racket going, bringing in women and girls from Eastern Europe, and sending them on the “Lolita Express”—to the Caribbean, New Mexico, even Thailand—for pimpy purposes.

So while Warren and the other Democrats have said nothing about changing age-of-consent laws—sex with minors being the peculiar predilection of Epstein and, apparently, of other of his rich associates—it’s obvious that if prosecutors have fewer points of leverage on the sex trade, then Epstein-type abuses are more likely to emerge.

Thus we can see: Legalizing prostitution would be a great comfort to many among the comfortable.

Yet at the same time, Warren’s plan would further afflict the afflicted. Few, if any, women truly want to be prostitutes, and yet if the global magnet of money—complete with marketing and hyping—is turned on and allowed to operate at full power, well, a lot of women, and girls, will be pulled, and pushed, into prostitution. We can observe: This is not liberation, it’s degradation. It’s not empowerment, it’s a kind of slavery—indeed, it used to be called white slavery.

But wait—there’s more! More, that is, to the Democrats’ plan to comfort the comfortable. You see, not only does Warren want to decriminalize prostitution, she also wants to decriminalize crossing the U.S. border. In other words, every trans-national pimp and procurer will have an easier time bringing nubile bodies across the border—no nosy border guards asking questions and getting in the way.

Fittingly, on October 8, Breitbart News’s John Binder analyzed Warren’s overall immigration plan, dubbing it a “donor class immigration plan.” Notably, Warren’s plan doesn’t include mandatory E-Verify for employers and employees, and so once again, it will be all the easier for sex workers to work—having come from anywhere in the world, regardless of their legal status.

To sum up, Warren offers a trifecta for comforting the comfortable: First, legalize sex work; second, legalize anyone crossing the border; and third, do little if anything about hiring non-citizens.

So yes, if she wins, Warren may raise rich people’s taxes. And yet for the randier of the rich, it’s a sweet tradeoff; they’ll pay more in taxes, but her policy platform offers them a happy ending."

Biden confidently proclaimed during an interview with CBS Evening News on Friday he is the Democrat frontrunner and claimed he is not concerned with how much money his competitors have in the bank.

“I know I’m the frontrunner. Find me a national poll with a notable – a couple exceptions. The last four that have come out – but look, this is a marathon,” Biden said. “This is a marathon.”

“You have less than $9 million in the bank. Bernie Sanders has $30 – nearly $34 million in the bank. Sen. Warren has $26 million. How do you compete against that?” CBS anchor Norah O’Donnell asked.

“I just flat beat them,” Biden said, adding that his campaign is on a course to do “extremely well.”

“I’m not worried about being able to fund this campaign,” he continued. ” I really am not, truly.”

His campaign’s actions, however, do not match up with the presidential hopeful’s rhetoric. His campaign on Thursday essentially modified its position on accepting Super PAC support and blamed President Trump for using advertising to “intervene directly” in the Democrat primaries in an effort to take down Biden.

“Let’s be clear: Donald Trump has decided that the general election has already begun,” Biden’s deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, said in a statement.

She continued:

He and his allies are already spending massive amounts of money on paid television and digital advertising to intervene directly in Democratic primaries with the goal of preventing Joe Biden, the opponent that Trump fears most, from becoming the Democratic nominee.

Both Warren and Sanders wasted no time to slam Biden for reversing course.

Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said the Biden campaign is essentially trying to “buy the primary through a super PAC that can rake in unlimited cash from billionaires and corporations.”

Shakir’s campaign statement, via Bern Notice, reads:

Joe Biden has spent his campaign promising elite donors that nothing will fundamentally change for them, and he has made clear to fossil fuel and pharmaceutical donors that he will be their ally. As a result, he has had trouble generating significant grassroots support from Americans who are getting crushed by those same big donors — and so his supporters are suddenly begging for help from super PACs, even though they are vehicles for the kind of corporate corruption that Democrats should be fighting to stop. Let’s be clear: super PACs exist for one reason and one reason only: to help billionaires and corporations bankroll a presidential campaign with unlimited amounts of money, in exchange for favors. Every Democratic candidate should forcefully reject any help from super PACs — and they should tell their supporters and surrogates to stop engaging with super PACs that aim to buy elections and undermine our democracy.

Sanders also criticized Biden during a town hall event in Marshalltown, Iowa, on Thursday.

“I don’t need a super PAC. I am not going to be controlled by a handful of wealthy people. I will be controlled by the working people of this country,” he said.

Similarly, Warren – who has pledged to refrain from attending big fundraisers and courting wealthy donors despite doing so during her senatorial bids and transferring leftover funds to cushion her presidential run – took a shot a Biden on social media but did not call him out by name.

“It’s disappointing that any Democratic candidate would reverse course and endorse the use of unlimited contributions from the wealthy to run against fellow Democrats,” Warren said.

“A handful of wealthy donors should not be allowed to buy the Democratic nomination,” she continued. That’s not who we are.”

“Every Democratic candidate should agree: Super PACs have no place in our primary,” she added:

“I know I’m the frontrunner. Find me a national poll with a notable – a couple exceptions. The last four that have come out – but look, this is a marathon,” Biden responded. “This is a marathon.”

The former vice president maintained the claim even after pushback by O’Donnell, who noted both Warren and Sanders have significantly more money in their campaign coffers.

“I just flat beat them,” Biden said, before adding, “We’re on a course to do extremely well. I’m not worried about being able to fund this campaign. I really am not, truly.”

Contrary to the former vice president’s assertion, most media outlets on both the left and right have deemed him to no longer be the frontrunner. In particular, outlets like Politico and The Washington Post have pointed to polls showing Biden well behind his rivals in the early caucus and primary states.

Since starting this campaign in late-April, Biden has dropped from leading by as much as double digits in states like Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada. A poll released from Iowa this week showed the former vice president in fourth place, trailing not only Sanders and Warren, but also South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

A similar situation has played out nationally, although to less of a degree. In the weeks after Biden first announced his campaign, he led the field by as much as 32 percentage points. In comparison, a Quinnipiac Poll from this week found the former vice president trailing Warren, 21 percent to 28 percent, respectively. A similar Quinnipiac Poll taken just before the most recent Democrat presidential primary, which most pundits agreed was not Biden’s best performance, had seen Warren leading the former vice president more narrowly, 30 percent to 27 percent.

Other national polls from around the same time, found Biden similarly displaced as the frontrunner:

Biden’s squandered lead in the polls has coincided with a drop-off in fundraising. Even though Biden started the race with a strong funding advantage, due to his connections with high-dollar donors, the former vice president ended the most recent fundraising quarter well behind his competitors. In between July and the end of September, Biden only raised $15.2 million. The sum was dwarfed by that raised by Sanders ($25.3 million), Buttigieg ($19.1 million), and Warren ($24.6 million).

Posing more of a problem for the former vice president, however, is that his campaign has spent heavily since announcing in late-April, depleting his total cash on hand to just $9 million at the end of the third quarter. His rivals, on the other hand, still have campaign coffers brimming with cash, especially Sanders who finished the reporting period with more than $33 million on hand.

All of that has led to even Biden’s former Obama administration colleagues, such as David Axelrod, acknowledging he is no longer the frontrunner."

According to recent reports from both the New York Times and Washington Post, Clinton has not taken a 2020 run off the table and is, instead, keeping tabs on the growing distress among some members of the Democrat Party, who are unhappy with the current selection of candidates.

“Hillary Clinton, according to two people close to her, has not ruled out jumping in herself, a sign that she is hearing similar dissatisfaction,” the Washington Post reported.

“But put it this way: It ain’t zero. And does she think about it all the time? Absolutely,” a source said, according to the Post.

Billionaire Michael Bloomberg is reportedly conducting himself the same way, telling those close to him that he would consider jumping in the race if Biden falters.

“Bloomberg is in if Biden is out,” a “New York billionaire with ties to Bloomberg,” told CNBC.

While the Times adds that the chances of either jumping in the race are “remote,” it indicates that Democrats close to the potential candidates “believe the only scenario under which they’d consider running is if Mr. Biden drops out or is badly weakened.”

A McLaughlin & Associates October 2019 poll released this week examined that scenario, taking Biden out of the equation and putting both Clinton and Bloomberg in the race.

While Bloomberg’s presence does not appear to make a significant impact, Biden’s absence and Clinton’s addition would cause Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to rise to the top of the national field with 23 percent support. Under the scenario, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) would maintain her top tier status with 20 percent support, followed by Clinton with ten percent support. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) would also gain a notable boost, coming right behind Clinton with nine percent support.

Andrew Yang (D) would also enjoy a bump, jumping to six percent, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with five percent support, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with four percent support, and Beto O’Rourke (D) with three percent support. The remaining candidates would garner two percent support or less. That includes Bloomberg, who would only see one percent support:

Sanders, who visited the Hawkeye State this week, officially picked up the endorsement of Linn County Board of Supervisors’ Stacey Walker. Walker is featured on the Des Moines Register’s “50 Most Wanted Democrats” list, which describes him as a “dynamic and charismatic speaker” who is continuing to “gain prominence on the Linn County Board of Supervisors”:

A Cedar Rapids native, Walker is active in the local community and Iowa politics. National Democrats like California U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander and Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, a possible 2020 candidate, campaigned with him in 2018.

While Walker said there are many qualified candidates in the race, Sanders is by far “the most progressive and best positioned to defeat Donald Trump in the general election.”

Walker added that Sanders “goes to the furthest” in terms of his sweeping progressive plans and added that the Vermont senator has been “talking about these issues for decades.”

He told the local CBS station:

When you add on top of the fact that he has brought together one of the most diverse coalition of supporters I think any presidential campaign has ever seen, what that means is we actually have a shot at achieving this ambitious policy program, because we’re going to have folks mobilize to put pressure on members of Congress to make sure we can pass this legislation.

Walker also told Politico that he is backing Sanders because the country needs someone with a “bold” vision in order to “course-correct from the disaster that Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have become.”

“That is what America needs to course-correct from the disaster that Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have become,” he said.

“We need a leader with a bold vision, and as a black man living in America, I’ve had enough of politicians telling me we have to scale back our dreams and ambitions,” he added.

O’Donnell, particularly, noted that Biden had not only lost his polling advantage but had also fallen behind competitors like Sens. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in fundraising.

“I just flat beat them,” Biden responded with a laugh before adding that his campaign was “on a course to do extremely well.” He said, “I’m not worried about being able to fund this campaign. I really am not, truly.”

Despite the former vice president’s bravado, his campaign has expressed increasing concern over its fundraising capabilities in the past few weeks.

“I hate to say it, but our opponents are way ahead of us when it comes to money in the bank,” Elana Firsht, a campaign aide, admitted in a recent fundraising email. “If we don’t pick up the pace here, we might have to make budget cuts that could seriously hurt our momentum in this primary.”

Although Biden started the race with a strong funding advantage, thanks to support from high-dollar donors, he ended the most recent fundraising period well behind his competitors. In between July and the end of September, Biden only raised $15.2 million. The sum was dwarfed by that raised by Sanders ($25.3 million), Warren ($24.6 million), and Mayor Pete Buttigieg ($19.1 million).

Compounding the problem is that the former vice president’s campaign has spent on luxury travel, depleting his total cash on hand to just $9 million at the end of the third quarter. His rivals, on the other hand, still have campaign coffers brimming with cash, especially Sanders who finished the reporting period with more than $33 million on hand.

Biden fundraising troubles stem from inability to make in-roads with small-dollar donors. Unlike Warren or Sanders, more than 2,800 donors have already maxed out to Biden’s campaign since his announcement, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In fact, top-dollar donors make up a far higher percentage of Biden’s campaign’s coffers than those of his competitors.

In comparison, only 38 percent of the campaign’s funds to date have come from individuals donating less than $200. Such a ratio poses an issue for the former vice president, especially now that his top contributors are prohibited by law from donating again until after he has secured the nomination.

Biden’s cash crunch was seen as the primary motivator for his campaign’s decision to jettison its stance of discouraging super PACs, which are allowed to raise and spend unlimited funds, on Thursday. The move came even after Biden had made a show this year of pledging to pass stronger restrictions on super PACs and dark money groups if elected president.

“Our Constitution doesn’t begin with the phrase, ‘We the Democrats’ or ‘We the Republicans,'” Biden said at a campaign event in May. “And it certainly doesn’t begin with the phrase, “We the Donors.”"

Kate Bedingfield, the former vice president’s deputy campaign manager, announced the decision on Thursday, framing it as a result of the President Donald Trump’s willingness to “intervene directly” in the Democrat’s primary process. Claiming that the president and his allies were already “spending massive amount[s] of money” to prevent Biden from becoming the nominee, Bedingfield said the campaign had no choice to abandon its earlier pledge to discourage the aid of super Pacs.

“In this time of crisis in our politics, it is not surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law to bring an end to this disastrous presidency,” Bedingfield said. “Nothing changes unless we defeat Donald Trump.”

The move comes as Biden’s campaign struggles to keep up in fundraising in comparison to candidates like South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (D-VT).

Although the former vice president started his campaign with a strong funding advantage, thanks in part to high-dollar donors, he ended the most recent fundraising period well behind his competitors. In particular, Biden only raised $15.2 million in the third quarter of this year, far below the sums brought in by Sanders ($25.3 million), Buttigieg ($19.1 million), and Warren ($24.6 million).

Posing more of a problem for the former vice president, however, is that his campaign has spent heavily since announcing in late-April, depleting his total cash on hand to just $9 million at the end of the third quarter. His rivals, on the other hand, still have campaign coffers brimming with cash, especially Sanders who finished the reporting period with more than $33 million on hand.

Biden’s cash crunch results from his inability to make in-roads with small-dollar donors. Unlike Warren or Sanders, more than 2,800 donors have already maxed out to Biden’s campaign since his announcement in late April, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In fact, top-dollar donors make up a far higher percentage of Biden’s campaign’s coffers than those of his competitors.

In comparison, only 38 percent of the campaign’s funds to date have come from individuals donating less than $200. Such a ratio poses an issue for the former vice president, especially now that his top contributors are prohibited by law from donating again until after he’s secured the nomination. David Kochel, the former chief strategist for Jeb Bush’s failed 2016 presidential bid, explained the problem to Politico this month.

“If you don’t have that perpetual, low-dollar fundraising machine, you can’t compete,” Kochel said. “Biden looks like he can’t compete with Warren, Bernie and Buttigieg. How’s he going to compete with Trump?”

As evidenced by its decision on Thursday, the campaign appears to have decided his best way forward is to rely on super PACs, which are allowed to raise and spend unlimited funds. Such groups are increasingly being scorned on the left — including Biden just a few short months ago.

When first announcing his campaign, the former vice president pledged not to accept any campaign donations from corporate PACs or federal lobbyists. Part of that pledge was also his assurance not accept money from super PACs, even going as far to discourage one that had already formed on his behalf.

“Vice President Biden does not welcome assistance from super PACs,” a campaign aide told the Huffington Post in April when asked about the PAC.

As part of its reasoning for rejecting the help, the Biden campaign pointed to the former vice president’s long record of championing campaign finance reform. The candidate, himself, elaborated on his position during an interview with PBS News Hour last year while discussing campaign finance advice he purportedly gave to Sanders in 2016.

“I’m the guy that told him, you shouldn’t accept any money from a super PAC, because people can’t possibly trust you,” Biden said at the time. “How will a middle-class guy accept you if you accept money?”"

Bill Weld (R-MA), is a Joe Biden supporter.

Weld appeared at the CITIZEN by CNN conference on Thursday with former governor and congressman Mark Sanford (R-SC) and former congressman Joe Walsh (R-IL). And as if to prove CNN is all about fake news even when it comes to the little things, the trio were featured in a panel titled “The Contenders,” which is a laughably false way to describe three losers who have less than no chance of beating President Trump for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination.

A more accurate title for the panel would have been “The Failures,” but that would have confused the audience into thinking that was the panel featuring CNN chief Jeff Zucker being questioned by his sycophantic Not-So-Mini-Me Brian Stelter.

Anyway, the most illuminating moment during Weld and company’s panel was when Weld blurted out that HELL YES he supports former Vice President Joe Biden for president.

“Could I vote for a Democrat? Hell yes. If it’s Trump against Joe Biden, I’m with Biden in a heartbeat,” Weld admitted.

Weld even said that with a few tweaks to her platform, he could vote for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

The most revealing part of this is that, of the three, Weld is the most accomplished and least crazy. Both Sanford and Walsh were recently booted out of congress by voters (Sanford in the primary).

What’s more, while serving as South Carolina’s governor, Sanford disgraced himself in 2009 after he disappeared for a number of days with the claim he had been out hiking the Appalachian Trail. The truth is that the married governor was sharing a bed with his mistress in Argentina.

Walsh served exactly one term in congress before losing his re-election bid, has said more racist things than even Joe Biden, and has so far raised only a little more money for his 2020 presidential campaign than the amount of money his ex-wife sued him over for unpaid child support ($117,000).

The 74-year-old Weld does at least have a distinguished record as a U.S attorney and two gubernatorial wins in Massachusetts. But then in July of 1997, he kind of flaked out halfway through his second term by abruptly resigning to become Bill Clinton’s ambassador to Mexico — except he never made it. Six weeks later he withdrew his name.

So this is all Never Trump can come up with: a racist, a guy who abandoned his political post and wife to have a fling in Argentina, and a guy who enthusiastically supports Joe Biden, a Democrat who supports post-birth abortion, allowing biological men to serve their time in women’s prisons, gun confiscation, another round of Obamacare, opening up the southern border, and reversing the Trump tax cuts.

So much for all those First Principles the vile grifters in the Never Trump crowd say they stand behind…

As we all know, both CBS News and Fox News had serious internal issues regarding sexual misconduct. But we also know CBS and Fox did two crucial things NBC refuses to do: 1) They both cleaned house with high-profile firings, and 2) they both hired outside investigators to come in (Fox did this twice) to ensure the public there was oversight and full disclosure by way of an objective third-party.

The following have been credibly accused of sexual misconduct and remain employed at NBC News:

Hardball host Chris Matthews – In December of 2017, we learned that NBC paid out a staffer $40,000 regarding a 1999 harassment claim against Matthews. NBC News claims it was all part of a normal severance package and the payout less than $40,000. But thanks to Ronan Farrow’s reporting, specifically in his must-read Catch and Kill, we know this is how NBC gets rid of sexual misconduct problems: the network disguises sexual harassment payoffs as severance and the alleged victim is then required to sign an iron-clad non-disclosure agreement.

NBC News chief Andrew Lack – Farrow has two sources alleging Lack’s misconduct. Jane Wallace, a former CBS anchor who claims the then-married Lack bullied her out of her job after their affair ended; and a young associate producer named Jennifer Laird who claims Lack turned “hostile” after their affair ended.

Lack denies the allegations.

Then there is the covering up for Lack’s close pal, Matt Lauer.

Even when Lauer was fired in late 2017, NBC tried to protect him (and NBC) by spinning a credible allegation of anal rape into something as innocuous as “sexual misconduct.”

What’s more, the idea NBC did not know about Lauer’s alleged predations prior to his firing is disputed by a number of on-the-record sources who not only claim they knew about Lauer’s behavior, they complained to management about it.

Finally, there is NBC covering up for Harvey Weinstein.

In Catch and Kill, Farrow doesn’t just tell the story of how NBC killed his investigation into Weinstein’s alleged serial predations (including the alleged rape of actress Rose McGowan), Farrow names names. The book is filled with on-the-record comments, filled with Farrow recalling events where he is not afraid to name NBC executives and lawyers who were in these meetings. Using these names and sources, Farrow tells the jaw-dropping story of all the mercenary maneuvers and ridiculous excuses NBC executives contrived to not report a bombshell story that would eventually win Farrow a Pulitzer.

NBC continues to claim Farrow didn’t have the story nailed down, but this is complete bullshit. First off, NBC told Farrow to stop his investigative reporting into Weinstein! Secondly, just weeks after NBC told Farrow to take the story elsewhere, the New Yorker published the story, and Farrow won that Pulitzer.

Yes, you read that correctly: NBC said Farrow didn’t have the story only weeks before that story was published and won a Pulitzer.

And then there’s the audiotape of Weinstein admitting he groped a model; verified audio from a police sting, that NBC News president Noah Oppenheim said wasn’t a story.

But Noah Oppenheim wants to be a screenwriter, you see; and just a few months earlier Oppenheim shared a table with Weinstein at a swanky event, you see; according to Farrow, Weinstein knew about Lauer’s alleged predations, you see; which, if true, (and only a dolt believes otherwise) allowed Weinstein to blackmail NBC into kicking a Pulitzer Prize out the door.

So you have all of this… all these credible allegations of sexual abuse, of serial-cover ups, of non-disclosure agreements, of shielding alleged rapists, of protecting Weinstein; you have NBC refusing to allow a third-party investigation, and yet you still have the full Democrat field — Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, etc., validating NBC’s abuse and cover-ups by agreeing to this debate.

War on women indeed.

In a statement, former Vice President Joe Biden congratulated ""our special forces, our intelligence community, and all our brave military professionals on delivering justice"" to Baghdadi. Author Marianne Williamson offered in a tweet ""Praise and thanks for the military bravery and brilliance that carried out the mission,"" and former Maryland Rep. John Delaney wrote on Twitter that he's ""grateful for the brave patriots who risked their lives to advance our safety and security.""

With Trump and Republicans likely to characterize the mission as a defining moment of his presidency ahead of next year's election, the lack of attention placed on his role in the operation could provide insight into how the field of candidates plan to discuss the news in the coming weeks and months.

Trump announced at the White House earlier Sunday that Baghdadi killed himself on Saturday during a US special operations forces mission that went after the ISIS leader. The President told reporters Baghdadi was under surveillance for a couple of weeks and that two to three planned missions were scrapped before the successful one was launched. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Sunday that Trump approved the raid ""late last week"" after being presented with different options.

In a Sunday tweet, entrepreneur Andrew Yang congratulated ""the special ops team that executed the mission and everyone in the chain of command,"" though there was no mention of Trump, who as commander-in-chief is at the top of the Pentagon's chain of command. Similarly, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, told CNN that ""everybody involved deserves credit, but those who were at the tip of the spear deserve the most credit."" Buttigieg also did not refer to Trump's involvement.

For now, though, the Democratic presidential field has been left to wait, and speculate, on what Warren's forthcoming plan to pay for ""Medicare for All"" will look like.

But the arrival of the most hotly anticipated policy document in recent political memory will only mark the beginning of a new chapter in the long progressive push for a federal single-payer health care system -- and this increasingly testy nominating contest.

The debate over Medicare for All, which Sen. Bernie Sanders pushed into the mainstream during his first presidential campaign, has mushroomed into a broader test during the 2020 primary. Sen. Kamala Harris , like Warren a co-sponsor of the legislation Sanders introduced in 2017 and 2019, wavered under pressure early on in the campaign and ultimately dropped her support in favor of a less ambitious -- and expensive -- plan, which she rolled out over the summer.

Warren took a different route from her Senate colleague, doubling down on the bill and famously declaring in June at the first primary debate, ""I'm with Bernie on Medicare for all."" Four months on, Warren is among the frontrunners for the party's nomination and, with the target on her back growing by the day, has come under intense scrutiny for failing to give a simple answer to a complicated question: ""How will you pay for it?""

Her campaign's formal response, which is expected to land some time before the next debate, is unlikely to spare Warren much criticism from her political rivals. The centrists, now headed up by her most vocal critic, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, are a good bet to remain focused on the increased spending required to make any major expansion work.

And the left, even if Sanders himself is unlikely to directly attack Warren, will pick through her plan for any sign of backtracking on that memorable commitment.

To date, Warren has responded to questions about middle class taxes by scrupulously avoiding the word itself, repeatedly guaranteeing only that overall ""costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down,"" while pledging not to ""not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.""

Warren has offered little insight into how her campaign is going about the process of drawing up its financing plan, and though outside economists have told reporters they are being consulted, their actual influence remains unknown.

Meanwhile, progressive lawmakers and policy wonks, some of whom have been turning this same Rubik's Cube for decades, are jockeying to shape the parameters of the next round of debate -- the one that will decide whether Warren's blueprint is viewed as mathematically sound and politically feasible.

There is an irony in Warren's conundrum.

Sanders, as he like to remind voters, ""wrote the damn bill."" But he has never offered a definitive cost estimate or locked himself into a matching ""pay-for"" plan, instead positing a menu of potential options -- like having employees pay a new 4% tax and employers a levy of 7.5%.

Think tanks across the ideological spectrum have filled the gap, meaning Warren not only has to decide on how to raise revenue for Medicare for All, but -- if she hasn't already -- choose from a range of cost estimates.

When asked about that on Monday, Warren stuck to her argument that Medicare for All represented the ""cheapest way to make sure that everyone gets covered."" When pressed on the particulars, she promised for the second time in 24 hours to deliver a plan in the coming weeks.

""The estimates on the cost of Medicare vary by trillions and trillions of dollars. And the different revenue streams for how to pay for it are many,"" Warren told reporters in Des Moines, Iowa.

By picking a lower end figure -- they range from around $14 to $34 trillion -- Warren could potentially argue that by shifting the new tax burden to employers, along with the richest corporations and individuals, she can make the numbers work without directly tapping the middle class. By most calculations, though, that might still not be enough to guarantee everything in the Sanders bill.

Whatever route Warren takes, the details her campaign publicizes are likely to live on well after the primary is over, no matter who wins the presidency in 2020. For now, though, her decision -- and how it is perceived by voters -- could affect her candidacy in conversations that run wider and deeper than the health care debate.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, right up there with or slightly ahead of Warren in most recent polling, has sought to cast Warren -- with the timing of her Medicare for All announcement as evidence -- as dissembling, unprepared, or both.

""It's mystifying that for someone who has put having a plan for everything at the center of her pitch to voters, Sen. Warren has decided to release a health care plan only after enduring immense public pressure for refusing to do so,"" a Biden campaign spokesman said late Sunday, shortly after Warren first teased the plan.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who has also launched a series of sharp salvos at Warren, struck a similar tone when she suggested, on the debate stage last week, that her colleague's refusal to deliver a plainly-worded answer to the tax question is symptomatic of some core mendacity.

""At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,"" Klobuchar said on the debate stage. ""And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice.""

And Buttigieg, when asked at a rally in Nevada this week if taxes would go up to pay for his public option plan, which he calls ""Medicare for all who want it,"" began with yet another shot at Warren.

""Good question, because not everyone has been answering this question,"" he said, before talking about his plans to undo President Donald Trump's corporate tax cuts and pointing to the savings that would come with allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices.

There has been, however, growing pushback in Democratic circles to the cost narrative that Warren's opponents, both in the primary and the party's policy trenches, are seeking to exploit.

Writing in USA Today earlier this week, Donald Berwick, who served as administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the Obama administration, sought to turn the tables on Medicare for All's most vocal critics.

""Some candidates have attempted to sidestep the cost debate by promising to spend less and accomplish the same goals,"" Berwick wrote, without naming Buttigieg, Biden or anyone else by name. ""These proposals, such as relying on a public option or expanding Medicare Advantage, offering private plans within Medicare, provide too few details to allow real cost comparisons. But it is unlikely they will do as much as Medicare for All would to reduce national health care spending or reduce costs for families.""

Still, the reality for Warren is that her rise in the polls, coupled with the always explosive politics surrounding health care, means that her next move -- and plan -- is just as likely to boost her further as undermine the brand she's spent so long building."

In past recessions, fast-growing emerging markets have helped bail out the global economy. But there's one thing standing in the way of history repeating itself this time: the strong US dollar.

As global growth slows and the United States' economy shows signs of weakness , investors are looking for places where their money will grow.

Emerging markets, such as South Korea, Brazil or India, are riskier to invest in but often grow faster than developed nations like Germany or the US. They also tend to be export-driven and often tied to commodity price moves.

In the recession following the financial crisis, China provided a boost for the global economy, growing nearly 9% on the back of strong domestic spending . ""Without China, global growth would have been negative in 2009,"" said Bank of America strategist David Hauner in a note.

But circumstances have changed in the past decade. China probably won't be the knight in shining armor this time. The country's economy is slowing too and it is more highly leveraged than it was a decade ago.

It will be hard for other emerging markets to step in and help avoid a global recession as long as the US dollar remains strong: Emerging economies tend to borrow in dollars. These countries are uniquely vulnerable to a strong greenback, which can make their debts more expensive.

A weaker US currency could alleviate that strain and allow emerging markets to grow faster, perhaps keeping the world out of a global growth recession . The Federal Reserve is gradually lowering rates, which could help to weaken the greenback. But it hasn't exactly been moving with any urgency so far -- certainly not as quickly as US President Donald Trump would like.

""Emerging markets can help to 'save the world' in this downturn, but this requires a weaker US dollar and thus a much more dovish Fed,"" said Hauner.

Developed countries like the United States and its European peers are also increasingly worried that their ultra-low interest rate policies aren't actually stimulating any growth. Japan has been the prime example of that, and investors are now talking about the Japanification of Europe. The US economy is expanding at a faster pace than its rivals, but growth is still slowing.

The Federal Reserve is meeting next week, and the chances of another quarter percentage point interest rate cut are over 90%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Whether this will be enough to knock the dollar remains to be seen. Currencies commonly weaken during periods of looser monetary policy.

Complaints about the strength of America's currency have mounted this year. From Trump to Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren , critics say the strong buck makes US goods less competitive on the global market.

The often-cited ICE US Dollar Index, which measures the currency against six rivals, is actually only up 1.6% this year. But a look at specific emerging currencies shows a different picture.

The dollar is up 1.9% against India's rupee, 4.1% against Brazil's real, and 5.5% against the South Korean won since the start of the year -- to a large extent because of the trade war.

Making matters worse, emerging economies borrow mostly in dollars, while their biggest customers mostly pay in euros, Hauner said. So these countries are also uniquely exposed to the euro-dollar exchange rate. This year, the shared European currency has fallen 3.2% against the greenback."

And they are going to deliver a country to us like Venezuela through people like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.”

As Breitbart News has noted, despite Warren’s populist rhetoric — where she has called out multinational corporations for having no loyalty to American workers — her campaign to win the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination has endorsed one of the most open borders platforms of all the candidates.

Warren Undercuts Populist Agenda with Donor Class Immigration Planhttps://t.co/RAdJlUT44k — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) August 28, 2019

Warren’s immigration plan includes decriminalizing illegal immigration and providing amnesty to all 11 million to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S. — policies that will force America’s working class to compete for scarce blue-collar and middle-income jobs against the world’s migrants.

Likewise, Warren has championed the donor class and Chamber of Commerce’s effort to increase legal immigration to the U.S. and thus driving up foreign competition against middle class and college-educated Americans.

Current immigration levels are already helping to hand electoral dominance to Democrats nationwide, research by the New York Times, Axios, and the Atlantic has noted.

The U.S. is set to bring at least 15 million new foreign-born voters to the country in the next decade. These voters’ swing towards Democrats has been realized in the 2016 presidential election, where despite winning almost 50 percent of native-born Americans, Trump lost foreign-born voters to Hillary Clinton by 64 percent.

Maher began by saying that elections in the U.S. are a binary choice, and “The question Democrats must ask themselves is, what would make a voter say, Trump’s right. I don’t like him, but I have no choice? Well, let’s go down the list: Bernie Sanders says we should let the Boston Marathon bomber vote. Why? Is there a great clamoring to give deranged serial killers more of a voice in civil society? … Now, I’m sure you can make an argument for this, but we’re trying to win an election here, and this just feeds into what Trump is selling.”

He continued, “Elizabeth Warren has not come out in favor of imprisoned serial killers voting, but she does want taxpayers to cover their sex-change operations in prison. Which brings up the question, if you tried, could you come up with a policy with more third rail buzzwords in it? … And again, where are the votes in this?”

Maher added, “So, let’s imagine a slightly different scenario, you’re a progressive voter who likes Elizabeth Warren. You drive a Prius, hate guns, and buy kale in bulk, but you find out that Warren does not support taxpayer-funded gender reassignment surgery for convicts. So, that’s it? Dealbreaker? You’re voting for Trump now? Of course not. This is the binary thing Democrats don’t get … They’ve got nowhere else to go. So, you can stop wearing your most divisive issues on your sleeve.”

And maybe, if one of them wins next year, they will, in fact, nick the rich a little—but don’t count on it.

After all, the last two Democrat presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, also campaigned on raising taxes on the wealthy, and yet during their time in office, the effective tax rate on top earners actually fell.

Still, the left likes to say that its goal is to “comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.” And yet maybe that’s just a campaign routine. Maybe sometimes the truth is closer to, afflict the afflicted, and comfort the comfortable.

How so? Well, one way of making the comfortable even more comfortable is by legalizing prostitution. That way, for those so inclined, the man—or woman—who has everything can have even more of everything, with no fear of the prudish police.

A case in point is Elizabeth Warren, whom the betting markets consider to be the Democrat most likely to win the 2020 nomination. On October 10, Warren tweeted some news sure to cheer rich johns—and, of course, poor- and middle-income johns, too: “I am open to decriminalizing sex work. Sex workers, like all workers, deserve autonomy and are particularly vulnerable to physical and financial abuse.”

We might translate some of this jargon-y code into simple English: “Sex work” is the politically correct way of saying prostitution, while “decriminalizing” really means legalizing, and “open to” means I’m in favor of it, but, I just can’t say so before the election.

So yes, legalizing prostitution is a part of Warren’s agenda. Indeed, at least four other Democrat presidential hopefuls—Cory Booker, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, and Bernie Sanders—have also declared their support, to some degree or another, for sex-worker “decriminalization.”

Indeed, such decriminalization is on the Democrats’ to-do list in, of all places, the nation’s capital. Here’s a Washington Post headline from October 18: “D.C. leaders hear from public over proposal to decriminalize sex work.” As the article detailed, the Washington, DC, City Council will be voting on the matter in November.

Fortunately, passage of the measure is far from assured; in fact, opponents are vocal and articulate. One opponent, Toni Van Pelt, president of the National Organization for Women, was blunt about what would happen if the bill passes: “Because this demand [for paid sex] cannot be met locally, traffickers will bring prostituted women and girls from other jurisdictions.” And so, Van Pelt continued, “D.C., the capital of our nation, would undoubtedly become a sex tourism destination.”

In the words of another opponent, Yasmin Vafa, executive director of Rights4Girls, “This bill is a sex trafficker’s dream.”

Covering the same story, the New York Times added:

All sides agree that prostitution practiced openly would reverberate well beyond the city’s thriving but shadowy sex industry of street prostitution, massage parlors, strip clubs and high-end call girls. Prostitutes would most likely work openly out of homes in neighborhoods across the city. Certain blocks could become de facto red-light districts.

In other words, D.C. wouldn’t just be the swamp, it would be the sex swamp. Yes, the reader can add any joke he or she might wish about politicians and/or lobbyists having new competition for whoredom, and yet still, it’s not amusing to think that the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial would be joined by the Hooker Hotel.

Yet we can further add a class dimension to the matter. That is, legal prostitution streamlines the process by which the rich buy—or at least rent—the bodies of the non-rich. Not every rich person is a customer, of course; plenty of fat cats are happily, and loyally, married. And yet it’s also true that the rich tend to spend more money on everything.

Let’s ask ourselves: Who has the most money to spend on prostitutes? Who can bid the highest price for flesh? So we see more clearly that the rich have the most to gain from legalizing sex work.

A case in point is Bob Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots football team.

We all remember Kraft and his brush with the vice squad; back in February, the “masseuse” who allegedly serviced him was busted on a prostitution rap. As for Kraft himself, he had better lawyers, of course, and so he wasn’t arrested. Indeed, his pricy attorneys are battling with prosecutors as of this writing; back in May, they persuaded a judge to toss out the video evidence, and so there’s no way to know how Kraft’s case will ultimately be adjudicated.

We just know this much: The optics have been horrible for Kraft. He would have been a lot happier if he could have just gone in and out, with no pesky police paying attention.

Of course, prostitution is not just for billionaires; it’s for any horndog with excess cash. And when it comes to disposable income, Democrats are way ahead. In fact, the ten richest congressional districts in the U.S. are represented by Democrats, as are 41 of the richest 50 districts. So with President Warren—or with any of the other pro-decriminalization Democrats–in the White House it seems likely that the laissez-faire approach to sex will become federal policy. And as we know, laissez-faire always works best for the rich.

Thus naughty Democrats, even non-plutocrats, would have a new category of pleasure on which to spend their money, legally.

To be sure, a pro-prostitution Department of Justice might not be able to override state and local laws (although, of course, we should never underestimate the power of liberal lawyers, working with liberal judges and the American Civil Liberties Union to think of tricky end-runs around traditional morality).

In any case, without a doubt, a Warren-ized DOJ would take some of the pressure off interstate and international and sex-trafficking. And that’s good news for Bob Kraft-types, both in America and coming from around the world.

Moreover, such a hands-off approach would be even better news for the next Jeffrey Epstein. We can recall that the late (we presume) Epstein had an international racket going, bringing in women and girls from Eastern Europe, and sending them on the “Lolita Express”—to the Caribbean, New Mexico, even Thailand—for pimpy purposes.

So while Warren and the other Democrats have said nothing about changing age-of-consent laws—sex with minors being the peculiar predilection of Epstein and, apparently, of other of his rich associates—it’s obvious that if prosecutors have fewer points of leverage on the sex trade, then Epstein-type abuses are more likely to emerge.

Thus we can see: Legalizing prostitution would be a great comfort to many among the comfortable.

Yet at the same time, Warren’s plan would further afflict the afflicted. Few, if any, women truly want to be prostitutes, and yet if the global magnet of money—complete with marketing and hyping—is turned on and allowed to operate at full power, well, a lot of women, and girls, will be pulled, and pushed, into prostitution. We can observe: This is not liberation, it’s degradation. It’s not empowerment, it’s a kind of slavery—indeed, it used to be called white slavery.

But wait—there’s more! More, that is, to the Democrats’ plan to comfort the comfortable. You see, not only does Warren want to decriminalize prostitution, she also wants to decriminalize crossing the U.S. border. In other words, every trans-national pimp and procurer will have an easier time bringing nubile bodies across the border—no nosy border guards asking questions and getting in the way.

Fittingly, on October 8, Breitbart News’s John Binder analyzed Warren’s overall immigration plan, dubbing it a “donor class immigration plan.” Notably, Warren’s plan doesn’t include mandatory E-Verify for employers and employees, and so once again, it will be all the easier for sex workers to work—having come from anywhere in the world, regardless of their legal status.

To sum up, Warren offers a trifecta for comforting the comfortable: First, legalize sex work; second, legalize anyone crossing the border; and third, do little if anything about hiring non-citizens.

So yes, if she wins, Warren may raise rich people’s taxes. And yet for the randier of the rich, it’s a sweet tradeoff; they’ll pay more in taxes, but her policy platform offers them a happy ending."

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) picked up the support of Linn County Board of Supervisors’ Stacey Walker this week, a coveted endorsement who is featured as one of the “50 Most Wanted Democrats” per the Des Moines Register.

Sanders, who visited the Hawkeye State this week, officially picked up the endorsement of Linn County Board of Supervisors’ Stacey Walker. Walker is featured on the Des Moines Register’s “50 Most Wanted Democrats” list, which describes him as a “dynamic and charismatic speaker” who is continuing to “gain prominence on the Linn County Board of Supervisors”:

A Cedar Rapids native, Walker is active in the local community and Iowa politics. National Democrats like California U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander and Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, a possible 2020 candidate, campaigned with him in 2018.

While Walker said there are many qualified candidates in the race, Sanders is by far “the most progressive and best positioned to defeat Donald Trump in the general election.”

Walker added that Sanders “goes to the furthest” in terms of his sweeping progressive plans and added that the Vermont senator has been “talking about these issues for decades.”

He told the local CBS station:

When you add on top of the fact that he has brought together one of the most diverse coalition of supporters I think any presidential campaign has ever seen, what that means is we actually have a shot at achieving this ambitious policy program, because we’re going to have folks mobilize to put pressure on members of Congress to make sure we can pass this legislation.

Walker also told Politico that he is backing Sanders because the country needs someone with a “bold” vision in order to “course-correct from the disaster that Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have become.”

“That is what America needs to course-correct from the disaster that Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have become,” he said.

“We need a leader with a bold vision, and as a black man living in America, I’ve had enough of politicians telling me we have to scale back our dreams and ambitions,” he added.

Sanders is currently battling for the heart of Iowa, edging out Joe Biden (D) but falling behind Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) in the latest Civiqs survey released this week.

The poll shows Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) leading in the Hawkeye State with 28 percent support, followed by Buttigieg, Sanders, and Biden with 20 percent, 18 percent, and 12 percent, respectively:"

The former vice president, who this week reversed his position on accepting help from super PACs, made the remarks when asked by CBS News’s Norah O’Donnell if he still considered himself the Democrat frontrunner. O’Donnell, particularly, noted that Biden had not only lost his polling advantage but had also fallen behind competitors like Sens. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in fundraising.

“I just flat beat them,” Biden responded with a laugh before adding that his campaign was “on a course to do extremely well.” He said, “I’m not worried about being able to fund this campaign. I really am not, truly.”

Despite the former vice president’s bravado, his campaign has expressed increasing concern over its fundraising capabilities in the past few weeks.

“I hate to say it, but our opponents are way ahead of us when it comes to money in the bank,” Elana Firsht, a campaign aide, admitted in a recent fundraising email. “If we don’t pick up the pace here, we might have to make budget cuts that could seriously hurt our momentum in this primary.”

Although Biden started the race with a strong funding advantage, thanks to support from high-dollar donors, he ended the most recent fundraising period well behind his competitors. In between July and the end of September, Biden only raised $15.2 million. The sum was dwarfed by that raised by Sanders ($25.3 million), Warren ($24.6 million), and Mayor Pete Buttigieg ($19.1 million).

Compounding the problem is that the former vice president’s campaign has spent on luxury travel, depleting his total cash on hand to just $9 million at the end of the third quarter. His rivals, on the other hand, still have campaign coffers brimming with cash, especially Sanders who finished the reporting period with more than $33 million on hand.

Biden fundraising troubles stem from inability to make in-roads with small-dollar donors. Unlike Warren or Sanders, more than 2,800 donors have already maxed out to Biden’s campaign since his announcement, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In fact, top-dollar donors make up a far higher percentage of Biden’s campaign’s coffers than those of his competitors.

In comparison, only 38 percent of the campaign’s funds to date have come from individuals donating less than $200. Such a ratio poses an issue for the former vice president, especially now that his top contributors are prohibited by law from donating again until after he has secured the nomination.

Biden’s cash crunch was seen as the primary motivator for his campaign’s decision to jettison its stance of discouraging super PACs, which are allowed to raise and spend unlimited funds, on Thursday. The move came even after Biden had made a show this year of pledging to pass stronger restrictions on super PACs and dark money groups if elected president.

“Our Constitution doesn’t begin with the phrase, ‘We the Democrats’ or ‘We the Republicans,'” Biden said at a campaign event in May. “And it certainly doesn’t begin with the phrase, “We the Donors.”"

As we all know, both CBS News and Fox News had serious internal issues regarding sexual misconduct. But we also know CBS and Fox did two crucial things NBC refuses to do: 1) They both cleaned house with high-profile firings, and 2) they both hired outside investigators to come in (Fox did this twice) to ensure the public there was oversight and full disclosure by way of an objective third-party.

The following have been credibly accused of sexual misconduct and remain employed at NBC News:

Hardball host Chris Matthews – In December of 2017, we learned that NBC paid out a staffer $40,000 regarding a 1999 harassment claim against Matthews. NBC News claims it was all part of a normal severance package and the payout less than $40,000. But thanks to Ronan Farrow’s reporting, specifically in his must-read Catch and Kill, we know this is how NBC gets rid of sexual misconduct problems: the network disguises sexual harassment payoffs as severance and the alleged victim is then required to sign an iron-clad non-disclosure agreement.

NBC News chief Andrew Lack – Farrow has two sources alleging Lack’s misconduct. Jane Wallace, a former CBS anchor who claims the then-married Lack bullied her out of her job after their affair ended; and a young associate producer named Jennifer Laird who claims Lack turned “hostile” after their affair ended.

Lack denies the allegations.

Then there is the covering up for Lack’s close pal, Matt Lauer.

Even when Lauer was fired in late 2017, NBC tried to protect him (and NBC) by spinning a credible allegation of anal rape into something as innocuous as “sexual misconduct.”

What’s more, the idea NBC did not know about Lauer’s alleged predations prior to his firing is disputed by a number of on-the-record sources who not only claim they knew about Lauer’s behavior, they complained to management about it.

Finally, there is NBC covering up for Harvey Weinstein.

In Catch and Kill, Farrow doesn’t just tell the story of how NBC killed his investigation into Weinstein’s alleged serial predations (including the alleged rape of actress Rose McGowan), Farrow names names. The book is filled with on-the-record comments, filled with Farrow recalling events where he is not afraid to name NBC executives and lawyers who were in these meetings. Using these names and sources, Farrow tells the jaw-dropping story of all the mercenary maneuvers and ridiculous excuses NBC executives contrived to not report a bombshell story that would eventually win Farrow a Pulitzer.

NBC continues to claim Farrow didn’t have the story nailed down, but this is complete bullshit. First off, NBC told Farrow to stop his investigative reporting into Weinstein! Secondly, just weeks after NBC told Farrow to take the story elsewhere, the New Yorker published the story, and Farrow won that Pulitzer.

Yes, you read that correctly: NBC said Farrow didn’t have the story only weeks before that story was published and won a Pulitzer.

And then there’s the audiotape of Weinstein admitting he groped a model; verified audio from a police sting, that NBC News president Noah Oppenheim said wasn’t a story.

But Noah Oppenheim wants to be a screenwriter, you see; and just a few months earlier Oppenheim shared a table with Weinstein at a swanky event, you see; according to Farrow, Weinstein knew about Lauer’s alleged predations, you see; which, if true, (and only a dolt believes otherwise) allowed Weinstein to blackmail NBC into kicking a Pulitzer Prize out the door.

So you have all of this… all these credible allegations of sexual abuse, of serial-cover ups, of non-disclosure agreements, of shielding alleged rapists, of protecting Weinstein; you have NBC refusing to allow a third-party investigation, and yet you still have the full Democrat field — Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, etc., validating NBC’s abuse and cover-ups by agreeing to this debate.

In a statement, former Vice President Joe Biden congratulated ""our special forces, our intelligence community, and all our brave military professionals on delivering justice"" to Baghdadi. Author Marianne Williamson offered in a tweet ""Praise and thanks for the military bravery and brilliance that carried out the mission,"" and former Maryland Rep. John Delaney wrote on Twitter that he's ""grateful for the brave patriots who risked their lives to advance our safety and security.""

With Trump and Republicans likely to characterize the mission as a defining moment of his presidency ahead of next year's election, the lack of attention placed on his role in the operation could provide insight into how the field of candidates plan to discuss the news in the coming weeks and months.

Trump announced at the White House earlier Sunday that Baghdadi killed himself on Saturday during a US special operations forces mission that went after the ISIS leader. The President told reporters Baghdadi was under surveillance for a couple of weeks and that two to three planned missions were scrapped before the successful one was launched. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Sunday that Trump approved the raid ""late last week"" after being presented with different options.

In a Sunday tweet, entrepreneur Andrew Yang congratulated ""the special ops team that executed the mission and everyone in the chain of command,"" though there was no mention of Trump, who as commander-in-chief is at the top of the Pentagon's chain of command. Similarly, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, told CNN that ""everybody involved deserves credit, but those who were at the tip of the spear deserve the most credit."" Buttigieg also did not refer to Trump's involvement.

He went on to say Clinton will likely only join the race if former Vice President Joe Biden drops out.

“If [Biden] goes away, there’s an opening for her because at that point all the Democrats are going to say, ‘Oh my God. Are we going to nominate Elizabeth Warren and be left with only a left-wing, crazy, George McGovern-like candidate to represent us in the election? We’re going to get clobbered! We need a moderate to come out,'” Morris stated.

He added, “[M]ake no mistake. She wants it. She’s planning on it. She’ll do everything she can to achieve it.”

Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) White House bid, calling her the “best candidate” running for president in 2020.

“My favorite — I’m going to say it, we’ll break news today — is Elizabeth Warren,” Legend said in a wide-ranging interview with Vanity Fair published Monday morning.

“She’s the best candidate running today and she comes at it with joy and with sincerity and with a wealth of knowledge and experience,” the All of Me crooner said of the senator.

“Honestly, I don’t comprehend why guys hate women so much sometimes,” he went on. “You see someone as transparently competent and eloquent and on fire as Elizabeth Warren and then you hear some guys just are not into voting for a woman. Why do guys feel so threatened by the idea of a woman president?”

Vanity Fair reports that Legend’s wife, model-turned-left-wing activist Chrissy Teigen, also expressed “love” for Warren, but said she also thinks highly about 2020 White House contender Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA).

“I also love Kamala Harris,” Teigen said.

As part of their sit-down with Vanity Fair, Legend and Teigen, both outspoken critics of President Trump, called the president, “sad, and petty, and narcissistic and immature.”

“I think there needs to be jail time for him, for the whole family,” Teigen told the magazine on the topic of the House Democrats’ secret impeachment inquiry into the president.

“I feel like he still gets away with everything if he gets out of his office,” she added. “I know that his first tweet after he’s impeached will be, ‘I didn’t want to be there anyway.’ ”

Of course, Legend and Teigen’s criticisms of the president has not gone way one.

Last month, President Trump took aim at the Hollywood couple for failing to credit his administration on enacting criminal justice reform.

“When all of the people pushing so hard for Criminal Justice Reform were unable to come even close to getting it done, they came to me as a group and asked for my help,” the president tweeted. “I got it done with a group of Senators & others who would never have gone for it. Obama couldn’t come close.”

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) because of their need for “more and more cheap labor,” columnist Ann Coulter says.

In an interview with Lars Larson, Coulter said America’s giant middle class will continue to be eroded should the billionaire class get their way on immigration where the ultimate goal is hemispheric open borders.

“We used to have … the hallmark of America was an enormous, enormous middle class. I mean, something like 80 to 90 percent of Americans describes themselves as middle class,” Coulter said. “You might be upper or lower within that, but there were not enormous gaps.”

“I mean, there is a problem with the oligarchs in this country and they’re the ones bringing in the cheap labor and they’re the ones — not all of them but a lot of them — who don’t care about the country per se,” Coulter continued. “They just want more and more cheap labor. And they are going to deliver a country to us like Venezuela through people like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.”

As Breitbart News has noted, despite Warren’s populist rhetoric — where she has called out multinational corporations for having no loyalty to American workers — her campaign to win the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination has endorsed one of the most open borders platforms of all the candidates.

Warren Undercuts Populist Agenda with Donor Class Immigration Planhttps://t.co/RAdJlUT44k — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) August 28, 2019

Warren’s immigration plan includes decriminalizing illegal immigration and providing amnesty to all 11 million to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S. — policies that will force America’s working class to compete for scarce blue-collar and middle-income jobs against the world’s migrants.

Likewise, Warren has championed the donor class and Chamber of Commerce’s effort to increase legal immigration to the U.S. and thus driving up foreign competition against middle class and college-educated Americans.

Current immigration levels are already helping to hand electoral dominance to Democrats nationwide, research by the New York Times, Axios, and the Atlantic has noted.

The U.S. is set to bring at least 15 million new foreign-born voters to the country in the next decade. These voters’ swing towards Democrats has been realized in the 2016 presidential election, where despite winning almost 50 percent of native-born Americans, Trump lost foreign-born voters to Hillary Clinton by 64 percent.

“I think there needs to be jail time for him, for the whole family,” says Chrissy Teigen, without specifying what crimes the likes of Melania, Barron, Tiffany, Eric, Donald Jr., and Ivanka Trump would be charged with. “I feel like he still gets away with everything if he gets out of his office. I know that his first tweet after he’s impeached will be, ‘I didn’t want to be there anyway.’”

The couple, who are major Democratic Party supporters and progressive activists and campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016, also used the interview to announce their preferred presidential candidates, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Teigen also expressed her admiration for Kamala Harris.

“My favorite — I’m going to say it, we’ll break news today — is Elizabeth Warren,” said Legend. “She’s the best candidate running today and she comes at it with joy and with sincerity and with a wealth of knowledge and experience.”

“I love Elizabeth Warren,” Teigen added. “I also love Kamala Harris.”

“Between the election of President Trump and Britain’s ongoing debate over Brexit, the billionaire philanthropist George Soros recognizes that populism is on the rise and that his brand of liberal democracy is faltering,” said Michel Martin, host of All Things Considered on taxpayer-funded National Public Radio (NPR).

Soros also has supported NPR, including $1.8 million given to the media outlet in 2011.

“When I got involved in what I call political philanthropy some 40 years ago, the open society idea was on the ascendant — closed societies were opening up,” Soros said. “And now, open societies are on the defensive and dictatorships are on the rise.”

“I have to admit that the tide has turned against me, but I don’t think that I have failed,” Soros said.

NPR portrayed Soros as a benign philanthropist who wants to promote democracy.

“That includes more than $32 billion in giving to his own international network of grant makers, the Open Society Foundations, which has worked to promote democracy in some 120 nations,” Martin said.

Also among his beneficiaries was presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton who got a $25,100 donation from Soros for her 2016 campaign.

The interview was to promote Soros’ new book In Defense of Open Society that “compiles a selection of his (often worrisome) essays in which Soros muses on what he views as modern threats to democratic societies — including social media and artificial intelligence, particularly when used by authoritarian regimes to manipulate the public.”

Soros, 89, said his priority now is fighting Trump’s alleged threat to the 2020 election.

“My foundation and I’m personally very much engaged in fighting voter suppression, trying to get a proper census and things like that that will lead to a fair election because those conditions are also endangered by the current president,” Soros said.

Soros stopped short of endorsing 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), but said she is “the clear-cut person to beat.”

“So he called her out. Every time he does something like his, he just makes himself look more terrible. I don’t know that that incrementally convinces anyone not to vote for him, but he just proves himself to be a shitty human being every day.”

Legend also said: “The biggest issue about this presidency is how they’ve just lowered standards for everything. Hopefully we’ll reset?”

In the interview, Legend discussed his friendship with rapper Kanye West, who is a Trump supporter.

The Chicago Sun-Times reported:

Chicago Public Schools announced Sunday that classes and after-school activities will be canceled again Monday after a frustrated Mayor Lori Lightfoot and district officials said negotiations with striking teachers remained stalled. CPS CEO Janice Jackson joined Lightfoot in a rare Sunday night news conference in which the mayor blasted the Chicago Teachers Union over the impasse in contract talks. “We are enormously disappointed that CTU cannot simply take yes for an answer,” Lightfoot said. “As of today, we’ve put everything we could — responsibly — on the table in an attempt to get a deal done, but we have no deal to announce today,” Lightfoot said. “For that, I am terribly disappointed.”

“CPS said as of 4 p.m., the Chicago Teachers Union said there was no possibility of a deal before the end of the day on Sunday. As a result, CPS said, it will not be possible to hold classes Monday,” CBS Chicago reported late Sunday.

As a result the 361,000 K-12 students who attend public schools in Chicago will miss their eighth consecutive day of classes, disrupting the lives of parents and students alike. Twenty-five thousand teachers, members of the American Federation of Teachers’ affiliated CTU, as well as an estimated 8,000 support staff, members of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) remain at strike.

The current strike is now the longest teachers strike in the city since 1987.

A gap of millions of dollars separates negotiators from the CTU and the CPS. The CTU says the gap is $38 million, while the CPS claims it is $100 million, the Sun–Times reported on Sunday.

The CTU has mounted an aggressive public communications campaign to attack Mayor Lightfoot’s negotiation stance, especially on Twitter:

Let’s just cut through the spin from City Hall and get to it: The money our schools need is there. The mayor isn’t bailing out CPS. She’s raiding her CPS piggy bank to avoid taxing the wealthy donors who put her in office. — ChicagoTeachersUnion (@CTULocal1) October 28, 2019

She’s shifting nearly $100 million out of the Chicago Public Schools budget—money that should go to students and classrooms—and using it to plug the budget hole for the city. — ChicagoTeachersUnion (@CTULocal1) October 28, 2019

1. $60 million in a pension cost shift

2. $33 million for the Chicago Police Department — ChicagoTeachersUnion (@CTULocal1) October 28, 2019

The strike has drawn attention and support from all the major Democrat candidates for the party’s 2020 presidential nomination. Last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) joined the picket lines in West Chicago, declaring “the unions are how we have power.”

Lost in the political power struggle between the teachers union and the city is the fact the academic performance of K-12 students who attend Chicago Public Schools has been well below national averages for decades, and shows little sign of improvement."

Judge William O. Bertelsman of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, a Jimmy Carter appointee, partially reversed his previous ruling in which he dismissed Sandmann’s $275 million lawsuit. The reversal will permit the Covington student’s lawsuit to proceed, reported LifeSiteNews.

Following the March for Life in Washington, DC, in January, many media outlets alleged a video depicted Sandmann, wearing a red “Make American Great Again” cap, and fellow students from Covington Catholic High School, as intimidating Native American activist Nathan Phillips near the Lincoln Memorial.

As Breitbart News reported, Sandmann “became the focus of the anti-Trump media” as an extended video and additional in-person reports of the confrontation showed it was Phillips who had intimidated Sandmann while the teen and his fellow classmates were simply performing school cheers as a group of Black Hebrew Israelites shouted racist insults.

The Washington Post admitted to the existence of vague “subsequent reporting” but neither retracted nor apologized to Sandmann for its false reporting.

Bertelsman dismissed the lawsuit based on the Post’s failure to name Sandmann specifically and said that the “rhetorical hyperbole” of the news outlet was protected by the First Amendment.

President Donald Trump tweeted that Sandmann was “smeared by media”:

Looking like Nick Sandman & Covington Catholic students were treated unfairly with early judgements proving out to be false – smeared by media. Not good, but making big comeback! “New footage shows that media was wrong about teen’s encounter with Native American” @TuckerCarlson — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 22, 2019

As Breitbart News also reported, Sandmann’s attorneys filed lawsuits as well against CNN, NBCUniversal, Democrat 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, the New York Times’ Maggie Haberman, comedian Kathy Griffin, and other media and left-wing activists.

Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, said in a statement to Breitbart News that, each day, her organization “defends the free speech rights of students to stand for life in public in what is supposed to be a free society.”

She continued:

The mistreatment of students as they attended the March for Life should offend all Americans who believe that each of us is protected when we act on our own consciences. It’s a good thing when a judge decides to respect students’ rights to be heard and to be seen with respect.

“As someone who works every day to defend the rights and needs of mothers and their preborn children, I know that the media often ignores and mischaracterizes pro-life Americans,” Hawkins added. “But our system of justice should protect the rights and freedoms of Americans who stand for the weakest among us, those whose life exists in the womb and who don’t have a voice or a vote.”"
891,"Jennifer Agiesta, CNN Polling Director",,"Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (21%) and Massachusetts Sen.

Bernie Sanders (21%) and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (18%) are in a close race among likely voters in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation Democratic presidential primary, according to a new CNN poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire.

Former Vice President Joe Biden stands a shade behind at 15%, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg rounds out the field of four who reach double-digits with 10%.

Biden, too, has lost support compared with the previous CNN/UNH poll, dipping 9 points since July and falling significantly behind Sanders. Biden's decline is the main change at the top of the new poll; the July survey found no clear leader, with Biden, Sanders and Warren all landing within the poll's margin of sampling error. Both Sanders and Warren hold roughly steady compared with their July results.

The former Vice President does continue to hold an edge among older likely voters, though, with 22% of those age 50 and older favoring Biden, 17% Warren and 11% Sanders. He also fares better among moderate and conservative likely primary voters than among liberals, holding 20% support vs. 17% for Sanders and 10% each for Warren and Buttigieg.

Warren and Sanders are far and away the top choices of the state's liberal likely voters (28% back Warren and 26% Sanders, double-digits ahead of Biden at 9% and Buttigieg at 8%).

Sanders dominates the contest among younger voters (31% of likely voters under age 50 back him, 12 points ahead of Warren, 21 points ahead of Buttigieg and 23 points ahead of Biden in that group), and tops his nearest competitor by 10 points among men (24% Sanders, 14% Biden and 13% Warren).

Warren holds the edge among college graduates (23% back her, 16% Sanders, 14% Biden and 13% Buttigieg), and runs about even with Sanders among women (21% Warren, 19% Sanders).

Still, with 105 days to go until the primary, only 23% of likely Democratic primary voters say they have definitely decided whom to support.

The poll, which is among those used by the DNC to determine which candidates qualify for upcoming debates in November and December, qualifies Buttigieg to take the stage in December. It marks Gabbard's second of four needed qualifying polls for the November debate, and a first qualifying poll for Gabbard, Klobuchar and Yang for the December debate.

Issues and attributes

Biden continues to be seen as the Democratic candidate with the best chance to win in the general election: 36% say so, well ahead of all other candidates. But Warren has gained ground on this question since July, rising from 9% to 18%.

Sanders has widened his edge as the most progressive candidate in the field: 47% see him that way, up from 40% who said the same in July. Warren has slipped on this measure, dipping from 23% to 18%. Sanders has also pulled ahead when likely voters are asked to name the most likeable candidate in the field, 27% name him, 20% Biden, 14% Buttigieg and 10% Warren.

Sanders tops the field as best able to handle health care (33% Sanders, 17% Warren, 15% Biden) and the climate crisis (30% Sanders and 15% Warren) -- the two issues which top New Hampshire Democratic voters' priority list -- while lagging a bit behind Warren (21%) and Biden (20%) on the economy (15% say Sanders would be best on that). Biden comes out on top when it comes to foreign policy (41% Biden and 12% each Warren and Sanders). Likely voters are split over who can best handle gun policies, with 14% each naming Warren and Sanders, 12% Biden, 8% former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and 6% Buttigieg. A sizable share of likely voters, though, say they aren't sure whom to trust on each of these issues, ranging from 18% unsure about health care and foreign policy to 31% on gun policies.

Favorability ratings for the top candidates haven't changed much for the top candidates since July, with unfavorable ratings inching up for Warren, Sanders, Biden and Buttigieg, but only Buttigieg substantially improving the positive side as well (his favorability rating rose 7 points to 55%).

Two less-well-known candidates saw substantial increases in their favorability numbers since July. About a quarter saw Klobuchar favorably in the July poll (24% favorable to 13% unfavorable); that's climbed to 40% now, with 16% on the negative side. Yang's numbers have also improved, with his favorability rating rising 19 points to 36%, turning around a net negative favorability rating (17% favorable to 19% unfavorable in July) into a net positive one by 12 points.

Republican primary not much of a race

Even as some other early states have cancelled their Republican primaries, both New Hampshire and the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa do plan to hold Republican contests. The poll suggests it won't be much of a fight, though. President Donald Trump continues to dominate among likely GOP primary voters, 86% of them support Trump, 5% former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, and 1% each former congressmen Mark Sanford and Joe Walsh. More than 6 in 10 say they have definitely decided whom to support (61%).

None of Trump's announced competitors hold a net positive favorability rating among the pool of likely Republican primary voters, and majorities are express neutral opinions or are unsure how they feel about Walsh, Sanford and Weld.

Trump unpopular but New Hampshire opposes impeachment

US President Donald Trump speaks during a ""Keep America Great"" campaign rally at the SNHU Arena in Manchester, New Hampshire, on August 15, 2019.

Hillary Clinton eked out a victory in New Hampshire in 2016 by just under 3,000 votes, and the state will likely remain a crucial battleground state in the 2020 general election. And as 2020 approaches, the president's approval rating in the state tilts negative. Among all adults, 44% approve of Trump's job performance while 52% disapprove.

""I love Elizabeth Warren,"" model Teigen told Vanity Fair.

Legend said he didn't ""comprehend why guys hate women so much sometimes.

""You see someone as transparently competent and eloquent and on fire as Elizabeth Warren and then you hear some guys just are not into voting for a woman. Why do guys feel so threatened by the idea of a woman president?"" he said.

Warren, who isn't hosting big dollar fundraisers, hasn't participated in celebrity-hosted events that have been traditional in past election cycles. But that hasn't stopped celebrities from throwing their support behind her.

Legend, using his legal name John Stephens, donated $2,200 to Warren's campaign in September, campaign records show. Other celebrity donors to Warren during the third quarter included actresses Lily Tomlin, who gave $200, and Rosie O'Donnell, who contributed $500.

Legend and Teigen, who are both politically active, had a public spat with President Donald Trump in September, after Legend appeared at an MSNBC town hall on criminal justice and Trump tweeted that Legend ""and his filthy mouthed wife"" took credit for his criminal justice reform

""Guys like boring musician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is - but I didn't see them around when we needed help getting it passed,"" the President wrote on Twitter at the time.

Teigen fired back: ""(L)ol what a p**** a** b****. tagged everyone but me. an honor, mister president,"" she tweeted.

""We know this president has a particular aversion to strong women coming after him, particularly women of color,"" Legend told Vanity Fair about Trump. ""So he had to call her out. Every time he does something like this, he just makes himself look more terrible. I don't know that that incrementally convinces anyone not to vote for him, but he just proves himself to be a shi**y human being every day.""

In the Vanity Fair story, Teigen also noted her affection for another senator and candidate: ""I also love (California Sen.) Kamala Harris.""

Elizabeth Warren targeted a top public policy executive at Facebook on Tuesday as she promoted a plan to take on what she said is a corrupt Washington practice: Corporations hiring well-connected former government officials.

In a series of tweets, Warren singled out Joel Kaplan, Facebook's vice president of global public policy, saying he was ""flexing his DC Rolodex to help Mark Zuckerberg wage a closed-door charm offensive with Republican lawmakers.""

Kaplan is a former deputy White House chief of staff who served under President George W. Bush. Following his hiring in 2011, Warren said, Facebook went on a lobbying spree, spending over $71 million. According to the Center for Responsive Politics , the figure to date is closer to $74.6 million. The company spent less than $400,000 in each of 2009 and 2010, prior to Kaplan's hiring.

In recent months, Zuckerberg has made multiple visits to Washington -- with Kaplan sometimes in tow -- and has sought private meetings with some of his biggest critics, including Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley.

Other prominent officials from government or politics whom Facebook has hired include Nick Clegg, former deputy prime minister of the United Kingdom; Kevin Martin, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission; and Katie Harbath, a former House staffer who went on to lead digital strategy for Rudy Giuliani's 2008 presidential campaign and for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

Morris wondered aloud if “the ghost of Hillary Clinton” will jump into the race, saying she “feels entitled” to run and “feels that God put her on the Earth” to run.

“I think at the moment, the issue is will the ghost of Hillary Clinton come out and get into the election? My feeling is she wants to. She feels entitled to do it. She feels compelled to do it. She feels that God put her on the Earth to do it. But she’s hesitant because she realizes the timing is bad,” Morris told host John Catsimatidis, noting her history with silencing sexual harassment victims and how she is “scared to death” of the #MeToo movement.

He went on to say Clinton will likely only join the race if former Vice President Joe Biden drops out.

“If [Biden] goes away, there’s an opening for her because at that point all the Democrats are going to say, ‘Oh my God. Are we going to nominate Elizabeth Warren and be left with only a left-wing, crazy, George McGovern-like candidate to represent us in the election? We’re going to get clobbered! We need a moderate to come out,'” Morris stated.

He added, “[M]ake no mistake. She wants it. She’s planning on it. She’ll do everything she can to achieve it.”

Sanders having his own plan seems to be breaking through with voters. When asked which candidate could best handle health care, it’s Sanders 33% to 17% for Warren to 15% for Biden.

The same gap between Sanders and Warren is apparent nationally as well. Sanders is more trusted on the issue by a 28% to 17% margin. It was the largest gap between the two on any issue tested. (They were basically tied with climate change.)

In New Hampshire specifically, climate change and health care tied at 16% (the top) for most important issue. It would therefore make sense that Sanders is quite competitive with Warren overall.

The question for Warren as she fights with Sanders is how to break free of him. She’s has had a stellar few months nationally, but has little to show for it in New Hampshire.

In the Granite State, Sanders is tied with her in the horse race, tied with her in favorability and is running ahead of her on the marquee issues. In fact, Warren's unfavorable rating is actually up 7 points since July.

A big part of Warren’s problem in our poll: those on the left. Sanders stands at 30% among those who call themselves extremely or fairly liberal; Warren’s at 25%. Nationally, Warren often crushes Sanders among these voters."

The paradox is that the candidates' focus on Iowa is increasing even as the state's odds of predicting the nomination's winner may be shrinking.

In every contested Democratic nomination race in this century, the winner of the Iowa caucuses has eventually won the nomination. That's a measure of how much momentum candidates can earn, especially in this era of pervasive news coverage, from winning that kickoff contest. Conscious of that history, the leading 2020 candidates have courted Iowa more aggressively than any other state on the primary calendar, whether measured by time, money or staff.

But the increasing diversity of the Democratic electorate -- compounded by the unique racial dynamics of this race -- raises the prospect that the 2020 contest could end Iowa's winning streak in predicting the eventual nominee. The reason is that while it's eminently possible to win Iowa, a virtually all-white state, without appealing to black or other minority voters, it's almost impossible to win the nomination without cross-racial appeal.

For that reason, some Democrats are looking to South Carolina, a heavily African American state that votes fourth on the primary calendar, as a better gauge of how the race will ultimately unfold than either Iowa, which votes February 3, or New Hampshire, which follows with the first primary eight days later.

""While I think Iowa is a good place to get your feet wet, New Hampshire is a good place to get your feet wet, South Carolina is a place where you dive in the political pool and really start to swim,"" says Antjuan Seawright, a South Carolina-based Democratic strategist who is uncommitted in the race. ""It is the state that will ultimately decide who the next nominee will be.""

The predominant role that Iowa and New Hampshire play in the nomination process has generated internal party tension for years because the Democratic electorate in each state remains about 90% white, in a party where as much as 40% of the primary voters across all the states may be nonwhite.

But the impact of that racial contrast has been muted in the party's four contested nomination races since 2000 for one big reason: The winners of the Iowa caucuses all performed well with black voters in subsequent states, particularly Al Gore in 2000, Barack Obama in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. (John Kerry, the 2004 Iowa winner, ran well, but not as dominantly, among African American voters.)

This year, though, polls point toward a heightened possibility of a divergence between the mostly white Iowa electorate and the more diverse states that follow.

Support among African Americans

Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has established a significant advantage in almost all state and national polls among white voters with college degrees, and in some surveys she's turned in very competitive showings among white voters without college degrees as well. That pattern of support has pushed her into the lead in some recent Iowa surveys . Given the strength of the organization she's built in the state, some local observers now consider her a clear favorite.

""Today I would say it is going to be really hard to displace Elizabeth Warren,"" says Jeff Link, an Iowa-based Democratic consultant who is unaffiliated in the race. ""She has not had a meteoric rise, she has had a slow and steady rise. She's got a big organization and they are smart and they are doing stuff all over.""

But Warren has seen little support in polls among black voters, who cast about one-fourth of all the 2016 Democratic primary votes, according to a cumulative CNN analysis . That's not a problem for her in Iowa -- or New Hampshire -- but it looms as a critical hurdle in the more diverse states that vote later, starting with Nevada and especially South Carolina. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who appear positioned along with Warren to perform well in Iowa, also have registered little support with black voters -- in Buttigieg's case virtually none ). Among the top tier of current Iowa contenders only former Vice President Joe Biden has displayed a consistent appeal for African American voters in polls.

That pattern heightens the possibility that Iowa's streak of picking the party winners might end next year. The biggest question remaining in the 2020 race, in fact, may be whether a disappointing showing for Biden in Iowa -- and possibly New Hampshire, too -- will cause large numbers of black voters in later states, especially South Carolina, to move away from him.

""I don't think it's going to have any impact on the decisive vote in South Carolina, which is African American voters,"" says Seawright. Iowa's ultimate effect on the nomination fight could turn on whether he's right.

Iowa and New Hampshire's impact only grew in 21st century

Historically, the impact of Iowa and New Hampshire over the Democratic nomination process can hardly be overstated. Since the modern primary process began in 1972, Democrats have picked only two presidential nominees who had not carried one of the two states: George McGovern in 1972 and Bill Clinton in 1992. Even the Clinton example comes with an asterisk: The Democratic contenders that year conceded Iowa to home state candidate Sen. Tom Harkin, and Clinton staged a dramatic revival in New Hampshire, successfully anointing himself as ""the comeback kid,"" after recovering from scandal to finish second to another regional favorite, Sen. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts.

If anything, the two states' influence appears to have deepened in this century. Not only have they picked the ultimate winner each time, but candidates who did not break through in one of them have been almost completely shut out everywhere else.

Democrats have had four contested 21st-century nomination fights: in 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2016. Over those four races, with about 200 total state contests among them, the number of primaries and caucuses won by a candidate who did not first win Iowa or New Hampshire is just five. All of those exceptions came in 2004, when John Kerry won both of the first two states and captured the nomination convincingly, but lost five contests along the way to his rivals, Howard Dean, John Edwards and Wesley Clark.

Iowa has seemed to eclipse even New Hampshire in the most recent Democratic contests: When the two states diverged in their choices in 2008 and 2016, the Iowa winner (Obama and then Hillary Clinton) beat the New Hampshire victor (Clinton and then Sanders) both times. And certainly in 2020, every tangible measure of campaign commitment signals that the candidates are prioritizing Iowa over New Hampshire and the other earliest states on the calendar Nevada and South Carolina.

Iowa is getting campaign cash and face time

Data collected by the CNN political unit from Kantar/CMAG, an ad-monitoring firm, shows that Iowa is receiving far more spending on television advertising than any other state.

Apart from billionaire investor Tom Steyer, a long-shot candidate who has spent enormous sums in all four of the early states, the candidate ad buys are heavily tilted toward Iowa. Biden, for instance, has already spent about $700,000 in Iowa, compared with about $5,000 combined in the other three states. Buttigieg has spent almost $2 million in Iowa television without spending anything in the other three states.

Three other candidates are devoting almost all of their television spending so far to Iowa: Sanders ($1.7 million in Iowa, about $1,000 in South Carolina) and Sens. Michael Bennet of Colorado (about $1.1 million in Iowa, nothing anywhere else) and Kamala Harris of California (nearly $600,000 in Iowa, nothing anywhere else). Though Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota is pitching herself in Iowa as a neighboring Midwesterner, she may be the biggest exception to this pattern so far: She's spent roughly even sums in Iowa and New Hampshire, nearly $500,000 in each case.

Warren hasn't yet aired any television ads, but the Kantar/CMAG data show that she's booked more television advertising in Iowa than anywhere else. Warren, however, has also booked million-dollar-plus commitments in the other three states; apart from Steyer, only Biden -- in South Carolina -- has made bookings in a future state anywhere near that large.

Campaign visits tell the same story. A tracker of campaign appearances maintained by the Ballotpedia website show that through October 1, almost all of the major Democratic candidates -- including Biden, Buttigieg, Sanders, Harris and Klobuchar -- had made about twice as many trips to Iowa as New Hampshire; only Warren has kept a closer balance between them. Harris has virtually moved to Iowa, and Buttigieg, who is launching another bus tour there this weekend after the Friday event, is close behind. The leading contenders have also blanketed the state with campaign offices and organizing staff.

""I think there are 650 campaign staffers currently in Iowa for presidential candidates,"" says Link, the Democratic consultant. ""That's got to be close to a high-water mark"" in the state's history, he adds.

In New Hampshire, 'a slow fall'

It's all been enough to leave New Hampshire feeling more than a little neglected. ""It's been a slow fall,"" says Dante Scala, a political scientist at the University of New Hampshire and author of ""Stormy Weather,"" a history of the New Hampshire primary. Scala says New Hampshire is receiving the least attention from the Democratic candidates probably since the 2004 race, when most of the field also burrowed into Iowa and largely ceded the first-in-the-nation primary to the two regional candidates, Kerry and Dean.

This year several factors appear to driving the campaigns to prioritize Iowa over the other early states even more than usual.

The first is the sheer size of the field. In polling this year, Democratic voters have already shown a clear reluctance to seriously focus on more than a few candidates, and the campaigns believe that narrowing tendency will significantly intensify once states begin voting.

The historic axiom has been that there are ""three tickets out of Iowa,"" meaning that only the top three finishers there remain viable in later states. Given the amount of money and media attention candidates can now command, few campaign strategists are sure that rule still applies, but no one wants to be the fourth- or fifth-place finisher who proves it does. Scala, in a view echoed by many campaign insiders, says the candidates seem to have concluded the race ""is like a 100-yard dash but there's not enough place on the track for everybody. If you lose that first step you might be done, and Iowa is that first step.""

Another factor tilting the candidates toward Iowa, especially relative to New Hampshire, is the belief that it will be very difficult for anyone -- even Biden -- to dislodge one of the two senators from neighboring states, Warren and Sanders. When New Hampshire voters have had the opportunity to pick a New England candidate, such as Tsongas, Kerry or Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, they have almost always done so. The high cost of competing in New Hampshire --because of the need to buy expensive television in Boston that reaches the Granite State -- adds to the reluctance of most candidates to launch full-scale New Hampshire efforts. For everyone except Biden, Warren and Sanders, the dominant assumption may be that the best way to run competitively in New Hampshire is to ride the momentum from a good showing in Iowa.

The concern about the cost of Boston television points toward the third reason Iowa has emerged as first among equals. With so many candidates running, the Democratic fundraising base has splintered to a point where no one commands the level of financial resources that say, Obama and Hillary Clinton did in 2008. Compared with the past few races, that means candidates can't afford to blanket all of the early states with resources.

The new dynamic

Yet despite all these factors steering the candidates toward Iowa, the prominent racial divergence emerging in the Democratic race increases the possibility that Iowa this year could send out a false positive, picking a favorite who does not ultimately win.

Even Biden's own advisers privately acknowledge that failing to win Iowa or New Hampshire would threaten his campaign. But whatever happens in Iowa, New Hampshire and even Nevada, the campaign believes that if Biden can retain enough support from black voters to win South Carolina, he could restore his viability. The calendar at that point would benefit him because so many of the states that vote in the next few weeks after South Carolina -- beginning with the Super Tuesday cluster of primaries just three days later -- have large populations of African Americans, Hispanics or both. That means it will be harder for Warren or any other remaining contender to win most of those states -- from Alabama and Arizona to Florida, Texas and California -- while depending primarily on white voters, especially those with college degrees.

Seawright, in fact, says it will be ""mathematically impossible"" for any candidate to run strongly on Super Tuesday without first receiving, in effect, a stamp of approval from African American voters in South Carolina. Biden ""can use South Carolina as a place of political rehabilitation and come out well,"" he says. Although it now looks less likely, South Carolina could also serve as a springboard for either of the two African American candidates in the race -- Harris or Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey -- if they first demonstrate strength in one of the three states that vote before it. Obama followed that model to eclipse Clinton in 2008.

Despite its public bravado, Biden's camp doesn't want to find out whether it's possible to win the nomination without carrying either of the first two, or even any of the first three, states that vote before South Carolina. But until one of Biden's rivals shows more appeal for African American voters, it's not unreasonable for his advisers to hope that it's South Carolina this year that will predict the nominee -- no matter how much time and money the field is lavishing on Iowa.

The request comes days after a federal court judge found DeVos in civil contempt for failing to stop collecting on some of the loans and fined the Department of Education $100,000.

The judge ordered the department to stop collecting on some debts in May, but since then, about 16,000 borrowers were incorrectly informed that they owed a payment on their debt. About 1,800 had their wages garnished and more than 800 were mistakenly subject to adverse credit reporting.

At issue is an Obama-era rule meant to help students defrauded by for-profit colleges that DeVos has sought to rewrite. She's referred to the previous administration's policies as ""social engineering"" and a "" staggering overreach ."" But consumer advocates have argued that her new version, set to go into effect in 2020, would make it harder for students to seek debt relief.

But as her fight to dismantle the regulations on for-profit colleges has gone on, a backlog of more than 200,000 applications for loan forgiveness has built up. Some former students have waited years to hear whether they are due debt relief.

The Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Last week, after the judge found DeVos in contempt, the department blamed the loan servicers, which it contracts to manage federal student loans, and acknowledged they ""made unacceptable mistakes.""

In a response to a sharp rebuke from Democratic presidential candidate and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren earlier this month, DeVos posted to Twitter : ""Loan servicers made an error on a small # of loans. We know & we're fixing it.""

In his letter to DeVos asking her to testify, House Education and Labor Committee Chairman Bobby Scott, a Virginia Democrat, said her tweet was ""downplaying the severity of this violation.""

""The characterization in your tweet is in stark contrast to the very real emotional and financial harm faced by 16,000 defrauded borrowers,"" he wrote.

In her ruling last week, US Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim wrote that the Department of Education demonstrated ""only minimal efforts to comply"" with her order. In a previous court hearing, the said she was "" astounded "" by the department's violation.

DeVos has already overturned one of two rules that were key to the previous administration's efforts to hold for-profit colleges accountable. That rule, known as Gainful Employment, would have withheld federal funding from for-profit colleges and certificate programs if their graduates failed to meet certain debt-to-income ratios. It never fully came into effect.

The request to testify tops off a week of attacks on DeVos' rollback agenda. Last week, House Democrats threatened to subpoena the secretary over documents related to payments made to a for-profit college chain that collapsed last year. On the same day, she was sued -- again -- by former students of a different for-profit college, along with the Massachusetts attorney general, over loan forgiveness applications.

DeVos is also facing lawsuits about the management of a loan forgiveness program for public sector workers. It was put in place under President George W. Bush, but the first time anyone would have made enough payments to qualify was the fall of 2017, under the Trump administration. Pointing to a high rejection rate, Democrats have argued that DeVos isn't doing enough to help borrowers apply. She has blamed Congress for creating a complicated rule.

Democratic presidential candidates Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are running on policy proposals that would cancel outstanding student debt for everyone -- or nearly everyone -- regardless of whether they were defrauded by a college. DeVos, in an interview with Fox News last week, called the Democratic proposals ""crazy.""

But even one of her own appointees admits there is a problem with the system. On Thursday, A. Wayne Johnson, who DeVos appointed as a top official in the federal student aid official, resigned, calling for the complete cancellation of outstanding student loans because ""we need changes in the law to save Americans from going into severe debt just to get a college education.""

Unlike Warren or Sanders' plans, Johnson also proposes tax credits worth up to $50,000 for those who have already paid off their debt. But, unlike the Democrats, he suggested the federal government get out of the student loan business all together."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) nationally and edging her out in early primary states, according to a Morning Consult poll released Monday.

Morning Consult has consistently shown Joe Biden (D) as the frontrunner, despite numerous national polls suggesting otherwise. The George Washington University Politics Poll released ahead of the fourth Democrat debate, for example, showed Biden falling to third place nationally, behind both Warren and Sanders.

Morning Consult’s latest poll, taken October 21-27, 2019, among 15,431 registered voters likely to vote in the Democrat primary or caucus in their state, showed Biden leading the pack with 32 percent. Warren, who has bested Sanders in a number of polls in recent weeks, tied with the Vermont socialist for second place with 20 percent support each.

The divide between the top tier of candidates and the remainder of the field has become more drastic, with Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) coming in a distant fourth place with just seven percent support, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) with six percent support, and Andrew Yang (D) with three percent support. The remaining candidates garnered two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 1 percent:

Sanders also made advances with voters in early primary states, which includes Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. While Biden leads with 29 percent support from voters in early primary states, Sanders surpassed Warren with 18 percent support to the Massachusetts senator’s 17 percent support.

Once again, Buttigieg came in fourth with eight percent support, followed by Harris and Tom Steyer (D) with seven percent and six percent, respectively. The early primary state results came from 611 voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. The margin of error was +/- 4 percent.

Voters were also asked to choose a second choice candidate. According to the survey, 28 percent of Biden supporters chose Warren, 28 percent of Warren supporters selected Sanders, and 30 percent of Sanders supporters picked Biden.

Sanders’ bump in the polls may be indicative of the power behind his recent endorsements from far-left members of the “Squad”– Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).

Tlaib was the latest to endorse “Amo Bernie,” praising him as someone who is “not going to sell us out.”"

Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) White House bid, calling her the “best candidate” running for president in 2020.

“My favorite — I’m going to say it, we’ll break news today — is Elizabeth Warren,” Legend said in a wide-ranging interview with Vanity Fair published Monday morning.

“She’s the best candidate running today and she comes at it with joy and with sincerity and with a wealth of knowledge and experience,” the All of Me crooner said of the senator.

“Honestly, I don’t comprehend why guys hate women so much sometimes,” he went on. “You see someone as transparently competent and eloquent and on fire as Elizabeth Warren and then you hear some guys just are not into voting for a woman. Why do guys feel so threatened by the idea of a woman president?”

Vanity Fair reports that Legend’s wife, model-turned-left-wing activist Chrissy Teigen, also expressed “love” for Warren, but said she also thinks highly about 2020 White House contender Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA).

“I also love Kamala Harris,” Teigen said.

As part of their sit-down with Vanity Fair, Legend and Teigen, both outspoken critics of President Trump, called the president, “sad, and petty, and narcissistic and immature.”

“I think there needs to be jail time for him, for the whole family,” Teigen told the magazine on the topic of the House Democrats’ secret impeachment inquiry into the president.

“I feel like he still gets away with everything if he gets out of his office,” she added. “I know that his first tweet after he’s impeached will be, ‘I didn’t want to be there anyway.’ ”

Of course, Legend and Teigen’s criticisms of the president has not gone way one.

Last month, President Trump took aim at the Hollywood couple for failing to credit his administration on enacting criminal justice reform.

“When all of the people pushing so hard for Criminal Justice Reform were unable to come even close to getting it done, they came to me as a group and asked for my help,” the president tweeted. “I got it done with a group of Senators & others who would never have gone for it. Obama couldn’t come close.”

“I think there needs to be jail time for him, for the whole family,” says Chrissy Teigen, without specifying what crimes the likes of Melania, Barron, Tiffany, Eric, Donald Jr., and Ivanka Trump would be charged with. “I feel like he still gets away with everything if he gets out of his office. I know that his first tweet after he’s impeached will be, ‘I didn’t want to be there anyway.’”

The couple, who are major Democratic Party supporters and progressive activists and campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016, also used the interview to announce their preferred presidential candidates, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Teigen also expressed her admiration for Kamala Harris.

“My favorite — I’m going to say it, we’ll break news today — is Elizabeth Warren,” said Legend. “She’s the best candidate running today and she comes at it with joy and with sincerity and with a wealth of knowledge and experience.”

“I love Elizabeth Warren,” Teigen added. “I also love Kamala Harris.”

Teigen is known for her vicious Twitter rants against Donald Trump, with the pair even getting into a Twitter spat after he referred to her as John Legend’s “filthy-mouthed wife,” to which Teigen responded by calling him a “pussy ass bitch”

Such is her dislike for Trump that she has even blamed him for her declining mental state, arguing that his presidency gives her crippling anxiety.

“So fucking tired of this manically insane, incompetent president and this dumpster fire administration I’m gonna have to go on another med,” she wrote in 2017. “I think I need to either up my dosage or talk to my doctor to ‘see what works for me’ when the world explodes.

Sanders, who faced an end-of-summer slump that intensified following the news of his heart attack, is regaining the ground he lost in recent weeks. The news follows a flurry of high profile endorsements from key members of the “Squad” – Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) – and notable Hollywood figures, like notorious anti-Trump filmmaker Michael Moore.

New Hampshire, the first primary state to vote, is one of the most desirable states for the presidential hopefuls, and a survey conducted by the University of New Hampshire indicates that Sanders is back on top.

The University of New Hampshire Survey Center conducted the survey on October 21 – 27, 2019 among 1,266 adults, including “574 likely 2020 Democratic Primary voters and 461 likely 2020 Republican primary voters.”

According to the survey, Sanders leads the pack with 21 percent support, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who falls three points behind with 18 percent support.

Joe Biden (D) comes in third with 15 percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with ten percent support.

Andrew Yang (D), Sen Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) followed with five percent support each. The remaining candidates garnered three percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.1 percent:

The results coincide with the Morning Consult poll results released this week, which show Sanders tying with Warren nationally and edging her out in early primary states.

The UNHSurveyCenter/CNN poll illustrates a rapidly changing landscape for the top tier of the race. A YouGovUS/CBS News poll released prior to the fourth Democrat debate showed Sanders falling significantly behind in the Granite State, with 17 percent to Warren’s 32 percent and Biden’s 24 percent:

Sanders has made a noticeable effort to combat concerns over his age and health in recent days.

“I’ve been criticized for being old. I plead guilty. I am old,” Sanders said during a campaign stop in Iowa last week, adding, “But there are advantages to being old.”

Sanders argued that his age proves that the “ideas that I am fighting for now didn’t come to me yesterday.”

“I’ve been on more picket lines, I expect, than all my opponents combined over the last 30 years,” Sanders said.

“Having a long record gives people the understanding that these ideas that I am talking about — they are in my guts. They are in my heart,” he added. “This is who I am as a human being, and it ain’t gonna change.”

Moore, who spoke at a Sanders rally in Queens this month, also defended Sanders’ age and health.

“It’s actually a gift that we have a 78-year-old American running for president of the United States,” Moore said, arguing that the Electoral College – not Sanders – is “too old.”

The Fahrenheit 11/9 director also dismissed concerns surrounding Sanders’ health.

“How about we talk about the health of this planet that’s dying. That’s the health I care about,” Moore added."

The presidential hopeful’s remark harkens to the ongoing beef Teigen has carried out with the president on Twitter, openly expressing her disdain for the Trump in tweets to her 12 million Twitter followers.

Sparks flew in September after Trump tweeted about Legend’s participation in a criminal justice reform town hall on NBC, blasting “boring musician @johnlegend and his filthy mouthed wife” for essentially ignoring his role in getting it done.

“Guys like boring musician John Legend and his filthy-mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is — but I didn’t see them around when we needed help getting it passed,” Trump tweeted.

….A man named @VanJones68, and many others, were profusely grateful (at that time!). I SIGNED IT INTO LAW, no one else did, & Republicans deserve much credit.

“Between the election of President Trump and Britain’s ongoing debate over Brexit, the billionaire philanthropist George Soros recognizes that populism is on the rise and that his brand of liberal democracy is faltering,” said Michel Martin, host of All Things Considered on taxpayer-funded National Public Radio (NPR).

Soros also has supported NPR, including $1.8 million given to the media outlet in 2011.

“When I got involved in what I call political philanthropy some 40 years ago, the open society idea was on the ascendant — closed societies were opening up,” Soros said. “And now, open societies are on the defensive and dictatorships are on the rise.”

“I have to admit that the tide has turned against me, but I don’t think that I have failed,” Soros said.

NPR portrayed Soros as a benign philanthropist who wants to promote democracy.

“That includes more than $32 billion in giving to his own international network of grant makers, the Open Society Foundations, which has worked to promote democracy in some 120 nations,” Martin said.

Also among his beneficiaries was presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton who got a $25,100 donation from Soros for her 2016 campaign.

The interview was to promote Soros’ new book In Defense of Open Society that “compiles a selection of his (often worrisome) essays in which Soros muses on what he views as modern threats to democratic societies — including social media and artificial intelligence, particularly when used by authoritarian regimes to manipulate the public.”

Soros, 89, said his priority now is fighting Trump’s alleged threat to the 2020 election.

“My foundation and I’m personally very much engaged in fighting voter suppression, trying to get a proper census and things like that that will lead to a fair election because those conditions are also endangered by the current president,” Soros said.

Soros stopped short of endorsing 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), but said she is “the clear-cut person to beat.”

“We know this president has a particular aversion to strong women coming after him, particularly women of color,” singer John Legend told the magazine.

“So he called her out. Every time he does something like his, he just makes himself look more terrible. I don’t know that that incrementally convinces anyone not to vote for him, but he just proves himself to be a shitty human being every day.”

Legend also said: “The biggest issue about this presidency is how they’ve just lowered standards for everything. Hopefully we’ll reset?”

Teigen said that Trump supporters are all bigots.

The Chicago Sun-Times reported:

Chicago Public Schools announced Sunday that classes and after-school activities will be canceled again Monday after a frustrated Mayor Lori Lightfoot and district officials said negotiations with striking teachers remained stalled. CPS CEO Janice Jackson joined Lightfoot in a rare Sunday night news conference in which the mayor blasted the Chicago Teachers Union over the impasse in contract talks. “We are enormously disappointed that CTU cannot simply take yes for an answer,” Lightfoot said. “As of today, we’ve put everything we could — responsibly — on the table in an attempt to get a deal done, but we have no deal to announce today,” Lightfoot said. “For that, I am terribly disappointed.”

“CPS said as of 4 p.m., the Chicago Teachers Union said there was no possibility of a deal before the end of the day on Sunday. As a result, CPS said, it will not be possible to hold classes Monday,” CBS Chicago reported late Sunday.

As a result the 361,000 K-12 students who attend public schools in Chicago will miss their eighth consecutive day of classes, disrupting the lives of parents and students alike. Twenty-five thousand teachers, members of the American Federation of Teachers’ affiliated CTU, as well as an estimated 8,000 support staff, members of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) remain at strike.

The current strike is now the longest teachers strike in the city since 1987.

A gap of millions of dollars separates negotiators from the CTU and the CPS. The CTU says the gap is $38 million, while the CPS claims it is $100 million, the Sun–Times reported on Sunday.

The CTU has mounted an aggressive public communications campaign to attack Mayor Lightfoot’s negotiation stance, especially on Twitter:

Let’s just cut through the spin from City Hall and get to it: The money our schools need is there. The mayor isn’t bailing out CPS. She’s raiding her CPS piggy bank to avoid taxing the wealthy donors who put her in office. — ChicagoTeachersUnion (@CTULocal1) October 28, 2019

She’s shifting nearly $100 million out of the Chicago Public Schools budget—money that should go to students and classrooms—and using it to plug the budget hole for the city. — ChicagoTeachersUnion (@CTULocal1) October 28, 2019

1. $60 million in a pension cost shift

2. $33 million for the Chicago Police Department — ChicagoTeachersUnion (@CTULocal1) October 28, 2019

The strike has drawn attention and support from all the major Democrat candidates for the party’s 2020 presidential nomination. Last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) joined the picket lines in West Chicago, declaring “the unions are how we have power.”

Lost in the political power struggle between the teachers union and the city is the fact the academic performance of K-12 students who attend Chicago Public Schools has been well below national averages for decades, and shows little sign of improvement."

Now he will get it. — Lin Wood (@LLinWood) October 28, 2019

Judge William O. Bertelsman of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, a Jimmy Carter appointee, partially reversed his previous ruling in which he dismissed Sandmann’s $275 million lawsuit. The reversal will permit the Covington student’s lawsuit to proceed, reported LifeSiteNews.

Following the March for Life in Washington, DC, in January, many media outlets alleged a video depicted Sandmann, wearing a red “Make American Great Again” cap, and fellow students from Covington Catholic High School, as intimidating Native American activist Nathan Phillips near the Lincoln Memorial.

As Breitbart News reported, Sandmann “became the focus of the anti-Trump media” as an extended video and additional in-person reports of the confrontation showed it was Phillips who had intimidated Sandmann while the teen and his fellow classmates were simply performing school cheers as a group of Black Hebrew Israelites shouted racist insults.

The Washington Post admitted to the existence of vague “subsequent reporting” but neither retracted nor apologized to Sandmann for its false reporting.

Bertelsman dismissed the lawsuit based on the Post’s failure to name Sandmann specifically and said that the “rhetorical hyperbole” of the news outlet was protected by the First Amendment.

President Donald Trump tweeted that Sandmann was “smeared by media”:

Looking like Nick Sandman & Covington Catholic students were treated unfairly with early judgements proving out to be false – smeared by media. Not good, but making big comeback! “New footage shows that media was wrong about teen’s encounter with Native American” @TuckerCarlson — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 22, 2019

As Breitbart News also reported, Sandmann’s attorneys filed lawsuits as well against CNN, NBCUniversal, Democrat 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, the New York Times’ Maggie Haberman, comedian Kathy Griffin, and other media and left-wing activists.

Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, said in a statement to Breitbart News that, each day, her organization “defends the free speech rights of students to stand for life in public in what is supposed to be a free society.”

She continued:

The mistreatment of students as they attended the March for Life should offend all Americans who believe that each of us is protected when we act on our own consciences. It’s a good thing when a judge decides to respect students’ rights to be heard and to be seen with respect.

“As someone who works every day to defend the rights and needs of mothers and their preborn children, I know that the media often ignores and mischaracterizes pro-life Americans,” Hawkins added. “But our system of justice should protect the rights and freedoms of Americans who stand for the weakest among us, those whose life exists in the womb and who don’t have a voice or a vote.”"
