Proaño, the chair of Plus Three, a fund-raising and technology group.

At a presidential forum sponsored by the League of United Latin American Citizens in Des Moines last month, Mr. Sanders spoke after Julián Castro, the former housing secretary, and Beto O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman. Only Mr. Sanders received a standing ovation as he entered the room.

In Los Angeles, a core group of Sanders volunteers from 2016 has stayed involved in causes they care about — successfully campaigning for a $15 minimum wage, marching with teachers during a weeklong strike for higher salaries and lobbying for Medicaid for undocumented immigrants.

Now, they are further galvanized by President Trump’s divisive language and hard-line policies toward immigrants. They are pressing their parents and their neighbors to join them, volunteering their Spanish at phone banks and organizing in the heavily Latino suburbs east of Los Angeles.

“In most campaigns, Latinos are usually an afterthought — we’re explicitly saying this is a cornerstone of our campaign,” said Rafael Návar , the California state director for the Sanders campaign. Earlier this month, the campaign opened field offices in the Central Valley and the Inland Empire, two heavily Latino regions of the state that are often overlooked in national elections. “We’re running the biggest operation in the biggest state, so we’re going to do better than we did the last time.”

In 2016, Mr. Sanders captured 45.7 percent of Democratic voters in California’s primary, compared to Hillary Clinton’s 53.4 percent.

The Sanders campaign office in East Los Angeles is tucked between taquerias in a small strip mall. During the October Democratic debate, it was filled with raucous energy — people in plastic folding chairs whooped with each jab Mr. Sanders took at the candidates surrounding him onstage."

A Steyer aide resigned

Pat Murphy, the Iowa political director for Tom Steyer, resigned after reports that he had offered campaign contributions to local Iowa candidates if they endorsed Mr. Steyer. The campaign said no contributions had actually been made.

“Our campaign policy is clear that we will not engage in this kind of activity, or any kind of communication that could be perceived as improper,” Mr. Steyer’s campaign manager, Heather Hargreaves, said in a statement on Friday announcing Mr. Murphy’s resignation. “Violation of this policy is not tolerated.”

Sanders released an immigration plan

Mr. Sanders unveiled his immigration plan on Thursday, pledging to use executive action if Congress does not pass comprehensive legislation.

He said that on the first day of his presidency, he would reverse President Trump’s immigration policies, including the denial of asylum claims and the “zero tolerance” policy that has led to family separations. He also vowed to halt all deportations “until a thorough audit of current and past practices and policies is complete.”

More broadly, he called for ending deportations of people who have been in the United States for more than five years, creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, expanding the DACA program and making unauthorized immigration a civil, not criminal, offense.

Our colleague Reid J. Epstein has more details.

Mr. Sanders has been working hard to win over Latino voters, our colleague Jennifer Medina reports. He has raised more money than any other candidate from Latinos, and was leading among them in a recent set of New York Times/Siena College polls.

Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey announced an economic justice plan centered on what he called the City 2030 Project, in which 50 or more small and medium-size cities would be chosen as regional hubs and given federal funding. The plan would also create a fund for communities hurt by policies like the 1994 crime bill; strengthen antitrust regulations and block some corporate mergers; and expand tax-privileged “opportunity zones.”

Mr. Biden was leading in five of the six states, while Ms. Warren enjoyed a narrow advantage within the margin of error in Wisconsin, where Mr. Sanders also appeared strong. No other candidate registered in double digits in any of the states surveyed.

While Democrats have unambiguously moved to the left in the decade since President Barack Obama took office, as Republicans eagerly point out, the poll illustrates that the party’s identity is more complex than the opposition and some progressive activists would portray it.

Democratic voters in the six states, each of which Mr. Trump carried three years ago, are split almost equally in how they described themselves ideologically: 49 percent say they are moderate or conservative, while 48 percent indicate they are very liberal or somewhat liberal."

Re “Trump Is Remaining Competitive if Not Popular” (front page, Nov. 5), about polls showing that the president is “highly competitive” against the three top Democratic candidates in battleground states:

A year out from the presidential election the Democrats are already making many of the same fatal mistakes they made in 2016. Elizabeth Warren, whatever her merits as a leader, will never beat Donald Trump in the general election. She, like Hillary Clinton before her, is perceived as too liberal by too many voters. Furthermore, I believe there is little either Ms. Warren or her supporters can do to change this perception over the next 12 months.

On the other hand, Joe Biden is seen as too moderate and ineffectual by many in the party. What will Warren supporters likely to do should Mr. Biden get the nomination? Just what they did in the last election when their favorite son, Bernie Sanders, failed to get it — stay home in protest.

All the while, President Trump and his people are lapping it up. Right now, things are going far better than even they dared hope.

To the Editor:

It ’s abundantly clear by now that it is futile for the Democrats to try to win over President Trump’s supporters. But there is another way they can win the battleground states, and with them the election: by taking advantage of the surplus of Democratic voters in California and New York. In 2016, the Democrats won those two states by a total of six million votes. If enough of these voters moved to the battleground states — retirees being the most obvious candidates — Mr. Trump would be defeated."

American economic history since World War II falls fairly neatly into two halves: a first era, ending roughly in 1980, during which progressive taxation, strong unions and social norms limited extreme wealth accumulation at the top, and the era of soaring inequality since then. Did the new prosperity of plutocrats “ trickle down” to the nation as a whole? Not according to any measure I know. For example, “multifactor productivity,” the standard economic measure of technological progress (don’t ask), has risen only half as much since the 1980 turning point as it did in the previous era.

What about politics? Many people on Wall Street and a significant part of the punditocracy are socially liberal but economically conservative, or at least leaning that way. That is, they are for racial equality and LGBTQ rights, but against major tax increases on the wealthy and big expansion in social programs. And that’s a perfectly coherent point of view.

Inside the billionaire bubble, however, people also imagine that it’s a view with broad popular appeal. Well, it isn’t. Most people, including many self-identified Republicans, want to see higher taxes on the rich and increased spending on social programs; however, quite a few people combine these sentiments with racial hostility and social illiberalism, which is why they seem to vote against their own economic interests.

As best we can tell, the constituency for social liberalism plus fiscal conservatism comprises only a few percent of the electorate. When Howard Schultz — remember him? — ran that combination up the flagpole to see if anyone saluted, only about 4 percent of voters approved. And early indications don’t show Bloomberg doing much better, even though as someone who successfully ran New York he has a much better case to offer.

I’m not saying that the U.S. public is necessarily ready for the likes of Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders. I worry in particular about the politics of Medicare for All, not because of the cost, but because proposing the abolition of private insurance could unnerve tens of millions of middle-class voters.

All of this is understandable. As my colleague Patti Cohen notes, if Warren’s wealth tax had been in effect since 1982, Gates would have had $13.9 billion in 2018 instead of $97 billion, Bezos would have $48.8 billion instead of $160 billion, and Bloomberg would have had $12.3 billion instead of $51.8 billion. They would still be billionaires, but Warren’s tax would have taken a significant chunk out of their assets. And even if the wealth tax never became law, a Warren administration would still take a hard line on financial regulation, consumer protection and tax enforcement, key areas of interest for the super rich. It’s impossible to imagine a Warren White House in which billionaires would have the same access and favored status that they do with Trump.

Warren’s wealthy critics are right to be nervous. And they have a right to speak out against her. But Bloomberg’s potential entry into the race — and Tom Steyer’s ongoing presence — shows that they’re not just giving an opinion. They want assurance that the Democratic nominee won’t be too disruptive. They want a restoration of the pre-Trump status quo, not a revolution. They want a veto of sorts, a formal way to say that Democrats can only go so far with their plans and policies.

The only response worth making to this idea is to laugh. Despite voter suppression, unlimited political spending and the president’s attempt to solicit foreign interference on his behalf, this is still a democracy. The final say still rests with voters, with ordinary Americans who retain the power to shape our government. And if those voters decide to nominate Warren or Sanders instead of a traditional moderate — and if either of those candidates beats Trump, as is very possible — then the billionaires will have to learn to live with the people’s will."

Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as a top candidate in Iowa, a Monmouth University Poll released Tuesday shows.

At 22%, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., received the most support in a survey of those likely to attend the state’s Feb. 3 Democratic caucuses. He is followed by Mr. Biden at 19%, Ms. Warren at 18% and Mr. Sanders at 13%.

The survey, which has a margin of error of 4.6 percentage points and was conducted Nov. 7-11, is the first major poll to show Mr. Buttigieg atop the field in Iowa.

Compared with Monmouth’s August poll, Mr. Buttigieg has gained 14 points, while Mr. Biden has lost 7 points. Mr. Buttigieg has gained support across nearly every demographic group, the university's polling institute said.

The race remains fluid, with less than a third of likely caucus-goers saying they are firmly set on their choice.

“Buttigieg is emerging as a top pick for a wide variety of Iowa Democrats,” Patrick Murray, the poll's director, said in a statement. “He is doing well with voters regardless of education or ideology.”

Other candidates registered single-digit support among likely caucusgoers, including Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar at 5%, California Sen. Kamala Harris at 3%, former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer at 3%, entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 3%, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker at 2%, and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard at 2%. All others were at 1% or less.

The poll also asked voters to name a second-choice candidate. When first and second choices are combined, Mr. Buttigieg at 37% and Ms. Warren at 35% are the leading picks. The survey also found that Mr. Buttigieg has the best favorability rating in the field, at 73%."

American economic history since World War II falls fairly neatly into two halves: a first era, ending roughly in 1980, during which progressive taxation, strong unions and social norms limited extreme wealth accumulation at the top, and the era of soaring inequality since then. Did the new prosperity of plutocrats “ trickle down” to the nation as a whole? Not according to any measure I know. For example, “multifactor productivity,” the standard economic measure of technological progress (don’t ask), has risen only half as much since the 1980 turning point as it did in the previous era.

What about politics? Many people on Wall Street and a significant part of the punditocracy are socially liberal but economically conservative, or at least leaning that way. That is, they are for racial equality and LGBTQ rights, but against major tax increases on the wealthy and big expansion in social programs. And that’s a perfectly coherent point of view.

Inside the billionaire bubble, however, people also imagine that it’s a view with broad popular appeal. Well, it isn’t. Most people, including many self-identified Republicans, want to see higher taxes on the rich and increased spending on social programs; however, quite a few people combine these sentiments with racial hostility and social illiberalism, which is why they seem to vote against their own economic interests.

As best we can tell, the constituency for social liberalism plus fiscal conservatism comprises only a few percent of the electorate. When Howard Schultz — remember him? — ran that combination up the flagpole to see if anyone saluted, only about 4 percent of voters approved. And early indications don’t show Bloomberg doing much better, even though as someone who successfully ran New York he has a much better case to offer.

I’m not saying that the U.S. public is necessarily ready for the likes of Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders. I worry in particular about the politics of Medicare for All, not because of the cost, but because proposing the abolition of private insurance could unnerve tens of millions of middle-class voters.

But the idea that America is just waiting for a billionaire businessman to save the day by riding in on a white horse — or, actually, being driven over in a black limo — is just silly. It is, in fact, the kind of thing only a billionaire could believe."

The journal entries paint a vivid portrait of a talented but troubled man who was both an earnest seeker of enlightenment and a neurotic perfectionist. (“I can be hard to work with,” he wrote in 2001, “because I demand truth.”) They also offer insight into Shandling’s development as a comedian and his growth as a person — and into how the two intersected.

“I will commit myself to becoming a stand-up comic,” he wrote in 1977, at the beginning of his transition from writer to performer. “I will not consider what will happen if I don’t make it, because once I commit myself it is done!” The evolution continued: “More writing and digging deeper — more than just jokes,” he counseled himself in 1982. Later that year, in anticipation of an appearance on “The Tonight Show,” where he would soon become a frequent guest, he wrote succinctly, “Just be Garry.”

“Just be Garry” is a consistent theme of the journals. “You don’t need to be successful,” he wrote in 1999, shortly after “Sanders” had ended its triumphant six-year run. “You don’t need to be funny or a good actor or writer. You don’t need to be anything. You can just be.”"

Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, was the only candidate to sit for an in-person interview with the union to seek its endorsement ; Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called in on a video chat and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., sent a three-minute video. Union officials said they had invited former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Kamala Harris of California to interview but each declined to do so.

Ms. Warren, another leading candidate for the nomination and Mr. Sanders’s top progressive rival, has also laid out a sweeping plan for single-payer health insurance, but the union stuck with the original architect of Medicare for all.

“ We enjoyed the difficulty this time around because last time the field was so barren” aside from Mr. Sanders, Ms. Ross said.

The endorsement also brings Mr. Sanders the support of the union’s super PAC, a thorny issue given that Mr. Sanders, like most of the Democrats seeking the party’s 2020 nomination, has disavowed support from super PACs.

In 2016 the union’s super PAC spent $5 million backing Mr. Sanders in the primary contest against Hillary Clinton, a relative pittance in the world of super PACs (the one supporting Jeb Bush blew through $87 million). Still, it spent more money backing Mr. Sanders than was spent by any other super PAC on behalf of Mrs. Clinton or other Democrats in the run-up to the Iowa caucuses."

Previously known to enjoy diner food and meals at Outback Steakhouse while on the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders — with prodding from Ms. Sanders, who often travels with him — is eating more nutritiously, often asking at restaurants if they have grilled fish. He recently ate a vegan breakfast. His most common order at Panera, a lunchtime go-to on the road, is soup and a salad.

“We’re getting better eating habits and making sure we can maintain them on the road,” Ms. Sanders said in an interview last month. “For him and for me, and for everybody else on the campaign.”

He has also incorporated more physical activity into his routine, frequently asking staffers to schedule time for a walk between campaign stops. The fashion-minded have noticed the upgrade to his wardrobe: Esquire magazine recently praised his look, writing that his knitwear in particular was “smart enough for a formal dress code, but softens the angles of a tailored suit.”

And while he has long been reluctant to speak about his age, he has begun to embrace it, arguing that it gives him the upper hand.

“I’ve been criticized for being old,” he said at a campaign stop in Marshalltown, Iowa, three weeks ago , his first since his heart attack. “I plead guilty. I am old. But there are some advantages of being old.”"

As a result, the voters on the sidelines are often also persuadable. With the exception of one key chunk of persuadable voters — affluent voters repelled by the left on economics — the persuadable voters wind up looking fairly similar to the low-turnout voters."

Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as a top candidate in Iowa, a Monmouth University Poll released Tuesday shows.

At 22%, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., received the most support in a survey of those likely to attend the state’s Feb. 3 Democratic caucuses. He is followed by Mr. Biden at 19%, Ms. Warren at 18% and Mr. Sanders at 13%.

The survey, which has a margin of error of 4.6 percentage points and was conducted Nov. 7-11, is the first major poll to show Mr. Buttigieg atop the field in Iowa.

Compared with Monmouth’s August poll, Mr. Buttigieg has gained 14 points, while Mr. Biden has lost 7 points. Mr. Buttigieg has gained support across nearly every demographic group, the university's polling institute said.

The race remains fluid, with less than a third of likely caucus-goers saying they are firmly set on their choice.

“Buttigieg is emerging as a top pick for a wide variety of Iowa Democrats,” Patrick Murray, the poll's director, said in a statement. “He is doing well with voters regardless of education or ideology.”

Other candidates registered single-digit support among likely caucusgoers, including Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar at 5%, California Sen. Kamala Harris at 3%, former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer at 3%, entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 3%, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker at 2%, and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard at 2%. All others were at 1% or less.

The poll also asked voters to name a second-choice candidate. When first and second choices are combined, Mr. Buttigieg at 37% and Ms. Warren at 35% are the leading picks. The survey also found that Mr. Buttigieg has the best favorability rating in the field, at 73%."

“The vilification of billionaires makes no sense to me,” he is shown saying in the ad. “It’s bull.” Then this flashes onscreen: “Charged with insider trading.” (The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Mr. Cooperman and his firm, Omega Advisors, in 2016; he and the firm settled in 2017.)

The ad closes with Ms. Warren asking the richest Americans to “pitch in two cents,” along with a list of social programs that could be funded with the revenue from her proposed wealth tax. Ms. Warren wants to impose an annual tax of 2 percent on net worth above $50 million, and 6 percent above $1 billion.

The journal entries paint a vivid portrait of a talented but troubled man who was both an earnest seeker of enlightenment and a neurotic perfectionist. (“I can be hard to work with,” he wrote in 2001, “because I demand truth.”) They also offer insight into Shandling’s development as a comedian and his growth as a person — and into how the two intersected.

“I will commit myself to becoming a stand-up comic,” he wrote in 1977, at the beginning of his transition from writer to performer. “I will not consider what will happen if I don’t make it, because once I commit myself it is done!” The evolution continued: “More writing and digging deeper — more than just jokes,” he counseled himself in 1982. Later that year, in anticipation of an appearance on “The Tonight Show,” where he would soon become a frequent guest, he wrote succinctly, “Just be Garry.”

“Just be Garry” is a consistent theme of the journals. “You don’t need to be successful,” he wrote in 1999, shortly after “Sanders” had ended its triumphant six-year run. “You don’t need to be funny or a good actor or writer. You don’t need to be anything. You can just be.”"

Union officials said they had invited former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Kamala Harris of California to interview but each declined to do so.

Ms. Warren, another leading candidate for the nomination and Mr. Sanders’s top progressive rival, has also laid out a sweeping plan for single-payer health insurance, but the union stuck with the original architect of Medicare for all.

“ We enjoyed the difficulty this time around because last time the field was so barren” aside from Mr. Sanders, Ms. Ross said.

The endorsement also brings Mr. Sanders the support of the union’s super PAC, a thorny issue given that Mr. Sanders, like most of the Democrats seeking the party’s 2020 nomination, has disavowed support from super PACs.

In 2016 the union’s super PAC spent $5 million backing Mr. Sanders in the primary contest against Hillary Clinton, a relative pittance in the world of super PACs (the one supporting Jeb Bush blew through $87 million).

Previously known to enjoy diner food and meals at Outback Steakhouse while on the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders — with prodding from Ms. Sanders, who often travels with him — is eating more nutritiously, often asking at restaurants if they have grilled fish. He recently ate a vegan breakfast. His most common order at Panera, a lunchtime go-to on the road, is soup and a salad.

“We’re getting better eating habits and making sure we can maintain them on the road,” Ms. Sanders said in an interview last month. “For him and for me, and for everybody else on the campaign.”

He has also incorporated more physical activity into his routine, frequently asking staffers to schedule time for a walk between campaign stops. The fashion-minded have noticed the upgrade to his wardrobe: Esquire magazine recently praised his look, writing that his knitwear in particular was “smart enough for a formal dress code, but softens the angles of a tailored suit.”

And while he has long been reluctant to speak about his age, he has begun to embrace it, arguing that it gives him the upper hand.

“Many critics are working from a set of pessimistic, establishment political assumptions that will, frankly, result in disaster,” he said. “The current model is unsustainable, and it’s wrong to assume that the plan accepts the status quo in terms of the costs and technology of today.”

But to most climate change experts, Mr. Sanders’s promise to reduce American emissions by 71 percent in a decade and to fully convert to renewable energy by 2050 may win high marks for ambition, but major elements of his plan to get there are implausible.

The heart of Mr. Sanders’s plan, a government-run effort to build, manage and distribute renewable energy on a vast scale, would cost more than $2 trillion if it could pass muster in Congress and, several economists said, it might not even curb emissions.

His rejection of nuclear energy and technology to capture carbon emissions would make his carbon-reduction targets much harder. His notion of paying for renewable energy by “making the fossil fuel industry pay for their pollution” is vague. And, economists said, his climate plan fails to consider his larger agenda, such as the new infrastructure projects in his economic plan that would create a burst of new emission s.

He also has little support from political activists. This has contributed not only to his financial deficit but also threatens his support in a relatively lower-turnout environment like a caucus. Mr. Biden was a distant fourth in Upshot/Siena polling, with 13 percent to 14 percent of support among voters who were “almost certain” to attend the caucus or those who had attended before.

All of this is separate from another question: whether Mr. Biden’s performance on the stump and on the debate stage is strong enough to retain his support as voters tune in more intensively. Mr. Biden’s resilience in the polls to this point suggests that these concerns could be overstated, though he does seem to have lost more ground in Iowa, where voters are generally paying more attention than they are nationwide. Of course, it is possible that Mr. Buttigieg’s rise, not Mr. Biden’s performance onstage, is primarily responsible for the weakening in his support.

Mr. Buttigieg’s gain might also come at the expense of another candidate: Ms. Warren, who also appeals to the meritocratic-minded, well-educated voters who tend to admire Rhodes scholars or Harvard law professors.

Ms. Warren’s rise in the polls has been impressive, but there is no reason to assume it will be durable. In Iowa, 78 percent of her supporters said they could change their mind, more than with any of her top rivals, according to the Upshot/Siena poll.

She has vulnerabilities of her own, and she has come under greater scrutiny since she began to match Mr. Biden in national surveys. Her position on “Medicare for all” funding has given her rivals an avenue to attack, and her standing in national and state polls has seemed to slump over the last month.

Her rivals could also point to questions of electability: Although there is still a long way to go, state and national polls show her underperforming her top rivals in matchups against President Trump."

“We have several moderates in the campaign now, but they’ve not been able to fill the lane,” said Marlon Kimpson, a state senator in South Carolina who has been hosting town hall-style events with presidential candidates. “Now, you’ve got all these people wanting to dip their toe in the water and test the likelihood that they can fill this role.”

Mr. Kimpson said Mr. Biden was still the most natural option for moderate voters, but warned that voters “don’t seem to be very motivated about his candidacy.” He said he was skeptical that either Mr. Bloomberg or Mr. Patrick could do better with such a delayed start, though he considered Mr. Patrick as by far the more intriguing option.

“I think Deval Patrick makes an excellent candidate, however, I am very, very concerned that he simply will not have enough time to make the case in the state of South Carolina,” Mr. Kimpson said, adding of Mr. Bloomberg, “We are familiar with him, but there doesn’t appear to me to be any excitement about his potential.”

Among the other Democratic campaigns, there is more confusion than consensus about what effect Mr. Patrick and Mr. Bloomberg might have on the primary, beyond straining the fund-raising efforts of other candidates who appeal to the business community. That could be an acute challenge for Mr. Biden, the only leading candidate who has been facing a significant cash crunch in recent months, as well as all of the less-prominent candidates hoping for a late breakthrough.

Neither of the two newcomers has done anything to build an operation in the early primary states, and Mr. Bloomberg has indicated he plans to skip those four February contests entirely. Any major effect they will have on the nomination fight would likely come in the states that vote after Iowa and New Hampshire, where the race is less defined."

And there’s a real question over whether they can actually craft a bill that passes muster with enough folks in Congress, and with the business community, and makes it all the way to President Trump’s desk, and he’ll sign it.

michael barbaro

Right. I remember this feeling like a perilous moment for this young presidency. It’s struggling to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and it is struggling to convince people to support its tax cuts.

jim tankersley

Right.

archived recording 1 There is a lot of discord within the Republican Party as to what works when it comes to tax reform and when it comes to health care. archived recording 2 Six months into his term, he has exactly zero big legislative accomplishments to boast about.

jim tankersley

If there’s one thing you would have expected a Republican president with Republican majorities to be able to do, it’s pass a big tax cut.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

jim tankersley

And yeah, we’re at this moment in the spring when that looks like that might not happen. And into the breach of that steps Fred Smith.

michael barbaro

And who is Fred Smith?

jim tankersley

Fred Smith is a former Marine who went to Yale and wrote a famous paper in a class that imagines a new type of company that is so wild in its imagination that he gets a C on the paper.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS]

jim tankersley

But he turns around and takes the basis of what he has sketched out on the paper into a company, and builds it into FedEx —

archived recording America, you’ve got a new airline. There’s no first class, no meals, no movies — in fact, no passengers, just packages.

jim tankersley

— this enormous, multinational shipping conglomerate and delivery company.

archived recording Federal Express, a whole new airline of packages only.

michael barbaro

And how exactly does the founder of FedEx, Fred Smith, get involved in this?

jim tankersley

Well, he has been an advocate for lower corporate tax rates for a really long time. And now he sees this opportunity with President Trump, a real ally of corporate tax cuts in the White House, to push this plan he’s been working on for years. And he does something more than just push the idea of tax cuts into the public discourse. He and his team at FedEx actually write their own plan —

michael barbaro

Wow.

jim tankersley

— their own tax proposal.

michael barbaro

And what’s in this Fred Smith plan?

jim tankersley

The FedEx plan is really centered around a big cut in the corporate tax rate, from 35 percent to 20 percent, and some extra carrots for businesses to be able to write new investments off their taxes right away, so two things that Fred Smith and a lot of other executives say are going to spur a renaissance of business investment in America.

archived recording (frederick smith) The fundamental problem with the U.S. tax code is that it punishes investment.

jim tankersley

The argument is that the United States was being held back in its economy by a lack of business investment —

archived recording (frederick smith) And at the end of the day, investment is what produces high-paying jobs.

jim tankersley

— that companies just weren’t spending money that they were sitting on, basically, and they weren’t spending it on capital spending that economists see as very important to economic growth.

archived recording (frederick smith) If you make the United States a better place to invest, there is no question in my mind that we would see a renaissance of capital investment, a growth in G.D.P. and an increase in an income for our blue-collar workforce in the United States.

michael barbaro

What kind of investments is Fred Smith talking about? When we talk about capital investments, what do we mean?

jim tankersley

We’re talking about plants. We’re talking about equipment. In FedEx’s case, we’re talking about airplanes or a transportation hub or new technologies that can help to deliver or sort packages faster. So something that can help you make your business run more efficiently — that’s the kind of thing that economists think of as big, productive capital investments.

michael barbaro

Got it. And the reason that would help the rest of the economy is someone has to build that plant, someone has to build that plane. It just ripples across.

jim tankersley

It ripples across for a couple of reasons. One, it creates demand for those products that are being invested in, which, yes, need to be built, and need to be installed or flown or whatever. But the other real argument is that having these new technologies put in place helps workers do more.

archived recording (frederick smith) Investment is the only way to make blue-collar workers, people that don’t have college degrees, more productive and have more income. So you can hire six people to move a pile of dirt, or you can hire one person with a bulldozer. The difference is the bulldozer. The bulldozer driver makes a lot more money than the people with the shovels.

jim tankersley

And the argument was that companies weren’t doing that because their profits were taxed too heavily. And it was more profitable for them to invest in other countries than in the United States because America’s tax rates weren’t competitive.

archived recording (frederick smith) It’s just like us playing basketball. And on our end of the court we’re playing with a 12-foot basket, and everybody else that we compete with around the world is shooting on a 10-foot basket.

jim tankersley

Fred Smith makes this very clear promise, saying, if we cut corporate tax rates, businesses are going to start investing again in America, and the economy is going to grow faster. And that’s going to help workers and everyone.

michael barbaro

Jim, how skeptical are people of the Fred Smith school of thinking here, that big corporate tax cuts will lead to big investments in the economy and to a lot of growth in the U.S.?

jim tankersley

Well, a huge part of Washington is not skeptical at all. They are pushing this. The Trump administration, Republicans in Congress, many sort of economists who support tax reform are arguing to one degree or another that there will be more investment, lots more, if you just cut the corporate tax rate. There is, though, this dissenting group, including a lot of Democrats and liberal economists, who make the argument that, hey, companies have a lot of money. They don’t need lower taxes to have just a little bit more money to invest it. If they want to invest it, they can. It’s sitting right there on their balance sheets. And cutting their taxes is not going to dramatically increase investment because that’s not what’s holding them back.

michael barbaro

And I’m curious, Jim, how much was FedEx paying in corporate taxes at the time that Fred Smith was making this argument?

jim tankersley

So throughout the time that he’s making this argument, FedEx is paying what it calls in its financial filings an effective tax rate of about 33 percent or 34 percent, which is a lot. In just the fiscal year 2017 alone, it paid more than $1.5 billion in taxes.

michael barbaro

So that’s a meaningful tax bill.

jim tankersley

It’s a meaningful tax bill. And it’s close to the top corporate tax rate in America, which is 35 percent before the Trump tax cuts passed.

michael barbaro

So what happens to the Fred Smith tax plan?

jim tankersley

The tax plan arrives in Washington and gets a warm reception, and it injects energy in what had been a little bit of a stalled process.

And it helps open the door again for all of the champions of tax reform to work together for a new bill.

archived recording (donald trump) And as a Christmas gift to all of our hardworking families, we hope Congress will pass massive tax cuts for the American people.

jim tankersley

So Republicans get back on track on the tax bill, particularly spurred on by the fact that they fail completely to repeal the Affordable Care Act. So now this is it. The business community is back on board, they’re lobbying hard. The Trump administration is working key details out with congressional negotiators.

archived recording President Trump is heading to Capitol Hill today to boost momentum for the tax reform bill that could become his first legislative victory.

jim tankersley

We enter the fall. The House passes a version of the bill.

archived recording Debate is still happening on the Senate floor. But this bill does appear to be gaining momentum.

jim tankersley

The Senate narrowly passes a version of the bill, with no Democrats supporting it. And then they put them together, and the final proposal includes the really big corporate rate cut. Basically, just like what Fred Smith and FedEx have proposed.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

jim tankersley

And it includes a bunch of other incentives for investment, also like FedEx had proposed.

michael barbaro

And then, of course, the bill passes.

jim tankersley

The bill passes. I do vaguely recall in my fever dreams from that time period of working 20-hour days that the bill did pass.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS]

jim tankersley

And the president did sign it into law.

archived recording (donald trump) The corporate tax rate, as you know, will be lowered from 35 percent to 21 percent. That means that more products will be made in the U.S.A. A lot of things are going to be happening in the U.S.A. We’re going to bring back our companies. They’ve already started coming back. I think they had a certain confidence in me. They figured we were going to get this done.

jim tankersley

This law includes individual tax cuts. It includes some other provisions. But the centerpiece, the thing it was sold on, was the idea that it would reinvigorate economic growth in America. And it would do that by supercharging business investment. It’s almost hard to understate just how often and vocally Republicans and the president made that case to voters, that this is what American business and the American economy needed for more domestic investment.

michael barbaro

So once this bill passes, what is FedEx’s tax bill? How much does it save?

jim tankersley

So the bill passes. And FedEx files financial statements for the fiscal year 2018 at the end of the year. And it shows that rather than paying $1.5 billion, like it paid the last year, it actually was owed money by the government. It has a negative effective tax rate.

michael barbaro

What?

jim tankersley

Yeah, negative 5 percent.

michael barbaro

So less than zero.

jim tankersley

Less than zero.

michael barbaro

Wow. And how much of that savings, $1.5 plus billion, is attributable to this tax bill?

jim tankersley

All of it. Over the first two years after the tax law, we can count $1.6 billion.

michael barbaro

Hmm. So that’s a pretty staggering figure. But then again, we know that FedEx plans to use that money to reinvest in the American economy.

jim tankersley

So that’s the story that FedEx told before the law passed.

[music]

But the story that played out is different.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So Jim, what happened with all this money that FedEx saved from this tax cut that it played such a huge role in shaping?

jim tankersley

FedEx had said, up to the eve of the bill being signed, that they were going to use the money to increase investment. But they didn’t. Investment actually went down compared to what they had projected. And then the next year, it went down again.

michael barbaro

Hmm. So what did FedEx do with these savings if they were not investing it in the kind of things that we all thought they would?

jim tankersley

Well, it largely rewarded its shareholders. It increased dividends, which is the money it regularly pays people who own its stock. And it bought back shares of that stock, which has the effect of pushing up prices of the stock for the people who own it. Now, to be clear, it did some good things for its workers, too. It accelerated some raises. It increased the size of its workforce. It made a large contribution to its pension plan. But the big winner were shareholders. And that’s a group that is largely, if you look at who owns stock in America, skewed toward the very wealthy.

michael barbaro

So the promise that FedEx made, that they would invest much of the savings from this tax cut into the kind of projects that would benefit everyday workers across the economy — instead, the benefit of the way they used this money really went to people who are largely already pretty well-off.

jim tankersley

In the short term, that seems very clear.

michael barbaro

Why do you think that FedEx did that?

jim tankersley

I had a lot of questions for FedEx about how they spent their tax money. I tried to ask some of the executives over a period of a couple months. I was never granted an interview with an executive. I sent very detailed questions, including one very similar to the one you just asked. Most of them went unanswered. I would love to hear FedEx’s explanation of how it has made the decisions it’s made with its tax cut windfall.

michael barbaro

Hmm. Jim, how typical was this for companies that received these big savings from the tax cuts, that they did not use it to invest, and instead they used it to buy back shares or pay dividends?

jim tankersley

It was very typical. My colleagues and I did a few different analyses to sort of demonstrate just how widespread this type of behavior was. And here’s a few ways of looking at it. One is that companies increased share buybacks and dividends by about triple as much as they increased investment following the tax cuts.

michael barbaro

Wow.

jim tankersley

Another is that investment has now grown more slowly since the tax cuts under President Trump than it grew before the tax cuts under President Trump.

michael barbaro

Which is another way of saying that the central claim of the tax cuts, and how they would be used, and how it would benefit the economy, that has just not come to pass.

jim tankersley

It is not.

michael barbaro

Jim, if these companies were to call you back, and you were able to ask what their thinking was, would there be an argument from a company like FedEx about why the way it chose to use this money is wise and will benefit the American economy?

jim tankersley

Absolutely. The argument goes like this. First off, rewarding shareholders is just another way to increase investment. Because those shareholders will use that money to invest in different companies, who will use that money productively. The other argument is that it’s just too soon to tell the effects of tax cuts on investment, that basically what changes for companies when you cut their tax rate is not, oh, they get a bunch of money today. It’s that investments tomorrow pay off even more. Because the profits you get back, you pay less taxes on. And so we would expect over time to see more investment, not right away.

michael barbaro

Is there any truth to that? Are these arguments from the companies about how they use this money accurate, that it eventually will really help the economy?

jim tankersley

I think there are mechanical truths that you can see to those arguments. But it’s also true that this is all really complicated, and that this was sold as a very simple relationship. Cut the taxes, investment will increase. And just the fact that we’re not seeing that happen right away flies in the face of the arguments that were used to sell the bill. I think that’s really important here, is that, yes, it may be true that investment over time is slightly more competitive in America because of a reduction in marginal business tax rates. But that was not what President Trump stood up at rallies and talked about. He talked about growing the American economy by 3, 4, 5, 6 percent a year because of all this flood of investment coming back to the United States. And we just don’t see it.

michael barbaro

Jim, why is this important, at the end of the day? I mean, these companies successfully lobbied for a tax cut. They got it. It’s their money. Theoretically, can’t they just do what they want to do with it, whatever that is?

jim tankersley

I think it’s important to hold politicians and their supporters accountable for the promises they make, particularly when those promises have real-world implications. The economy is not performing as well as we were promised it would when the tax cuts were passed. It’s not growing as fast. It doesn’t have as much investment. And if you believe the arguments that were made to sell this, that’s hurting workers. Because slower growth is keeping their incomes from rising as fast as they should be. So real people are suffering from not having that additional growth that they were promised they would have and now don’t. A then there’s this one last thing, which is this all comes at a cost. It’s not free to just give money back to corporations by cutting their tax bills. Despite what the proponents said, which was that the law would pay for itself — the additional growth — what we’re actually seeing is a massive, hundreds-of-billions-of-dollars-a-year effect to grow the federal budget deficit. And last year, that deficit came very close to topping $1 trillion.

michael barbaro

And how big a role is the tax cut playing in that ballooning deficit?

jim tankersley

It is the primary driver of additional deficits beyond what we had already before the law was passed.

He also has little support from political activists. This has contributed not only to his financial deficit but also threatens his support in a relatively lower-turnout environment like a caucus. Mr. Biden was a distant fourth in Upshot/Siena polling, with 13 percent to 14 percent of support among voters who were “almost certain” to attend the caucus or those who had attended before.

All of this is separate from another question: whether Mr. Biden’s performance on the stump and on the debate stage is strong enough to retain his support as voters tune in more intensively. Mr. Biden’s resilience in the polls to this point suggests that these concerns could be overstated, though he does seem to have lost more ground in Iowa, where voters are generally paying more attention than they are nationwide. Of course, it is possible that Mr. Buttigieg’s rise, not Mr. Biden’s performance onstage, is primarily responsible for the weakening in his support.

Mr. Buttigieg’s gain might also come at the expense of another candidate: Ms. Warren, who also appeals to the meritocratic-minded, well-educated voters who tend to admire Rhodes scholars or Harvard law professors.

Ms. Warren’s rise in the polls has been impressive, but there is no reason to assume it will be durable. In Iowa, 78 percent of her supporters said they could change their mind, more than with any of her top rivals, according to the Upshot/Siena poll.

She has vulnerabilities of her own, and she has come under greater scrutiny since she began to match Mr. Biden in national surveys. Her position on “Medicare for all” funding has given her rivals an avenue to attack, and her standing in national and state polls has seemed to slump over the last month.

Her rivals could also point to questions of electability: Although there is still a long way to go, state and national polls show her underperforming her top rivals in matchups against President Trump."

I submitted my answers. I checked the clock. Three minutes had passed. I had just earned another 5 cents on a digital work marketplace run by Amazon called Mechanical Turk. At least I thought I had. Weeks later, I’m still not sure. There are lots of ways to make a little money in this world. Amazon Mechanical Turk, which since 2005 has flourished, to varying degrees, in an obscure corner of the globe-striding behemoth’s empire, offers an uncertain, mystifying and often maddening way to make very, very little money. On Mechanical Turk — named for a chess-playing “machine” from the 18th century that concealed a living chess master — scores of thousands of humans earn pennies or dollars doing tasks that computers cannot yet easily do. It works like this: Employers, known as requesters, post batches of what are called Human Intelligence Tasks, or HITs, on Mechanical Turk’s website. A task could be transcribing an invoice, or taking part in a study, or labeling photographs to train an artificial intelligence program. (Occasionally a photo shows something disturbing, like a beheading.) Freelance workers, known informally as turkers, race to grab and do the tasks, providing what Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, once called “artificial artificial intelligence.” Most tasks pay a dime or less, and there is a daily churn of tasks that pay only a penny. And the weird thing is that workers — mostly American workers — will do them, for many different reasons. People turk to save for a motorcycle. They turk to buy insulin. They turk to pay off debt or pass the time profitably while on the clock at a boring job. Some do it because there are few decent-paying jobs that can be done at will. People who are confined to their homes by disability or social anxiety or who live where there are few jobs do it because, despite lousy wages, it seems like the best option. Plenty turk full time. In a 2016 Pew Research Center survey of nearly 3,000 American turkers, a quarter said they made most or all of their earned income on the platform. More than half the turkers surveyed said they earned under $5 an hour. ⚙️ Try Your Hand at Turking Throughout this story we’ll give you the chance to do HITs (Human Intelligence Tasks) that The Times has devised based on ones that novice workers like me encounter on Mechanical Turk.

As little as turking appears to pay on paper, in practice it often pays less because MTurk, as it is known, is a sloppy, shoddy free-for-all. Turkers spend their time fighting requesters over an unfair 10-cent rejection or a missing 60-cent payment. They waste minutes filling out bubbles on defective questionnaires that cannot be submitted. They abandon “10-minute” surveys after half an hour. They swap horror stories and warnings on turker message boards (“rejection on a $0.50 hit,” read one recent bulletin, “reason is ‘funds were not allocated’”). They leave scathing reviews on the turker-run site Turkopticon (“unfair and wild use of the rejection button”). Just how much turkers make is the subject of considerable scholarly debate, but one paper published last year analyzed millions of tasks done by thousands of turkers. Though they probably overrepresented novice turkers like me who do the lowest-paying tasks, the paper’s authors concluded that if you count time spent looking for tasks and working on tasks that came to nothing, the median turker’s hourly wage was $1.77. Only 4 percent of turkers, the researchers found, made more than the federal minimum wage, $7.25 an hour. Advertisement Presiding over this production is the world’s biggest tech company, feet firmly planted on the sidelines. Amazon usually declines to get involved when turkers say requesters rip them off, even as it lets requesters hide behind aliases that can make them impossible to track down. It has ignored turkers’ pleas to mandate higher wages, even as it takes a cut of each transaction ranging from 17 to 50 percent; a requester posting a 1-cent HIT pays one penny to the turker and another to Amazon. Amazon even finds ways to recoup some of the pennies turkers earn, a reminder of the days when miners were paid in scrip redeemable only at the company store. While American turkers can get their wages direct-deposited, thousands of turkers overseas have only one way to get paid without incurring third-party fees: on an Amazon gift card. While Amazon pays all of its American employees at least $15 an hour and favors raising the minimum wage, the company declined numerous requests to comment about the pay policy for turkers or anything else regarding Mechanical Turk. Minimum-wage laws generally do not apply to piecework jobs like turking. Mechanical Turk is now one of a handful of big players in the field known as crowdwork or microwork. (One crowdwork company, Prolific, used by academic researchers, enforces a minimum wage: $6.50 an hour.) Crowdwork’s proponents see a gleaming future — a borderless, no-overhead labor market where task-creator and task-doer meet at the intersection of supply and demand. Its critics see a throwback to something more Dickensian, where the lack of regulation and accountability keeps workers in the dark and on the defensive. Mechanical Turk, in particular, combines the inconsistency and precariousness of gig work with Big Tech’s tendency to dodge liability for the icky things that happen on its platforms. “This is a great little microcosm of what happens when you take away any rules and the wages fall to the bottom,” said Kristy Milland, a former turker turned labor activist who was one of the authors of the paper that analyzed turkers’ earnings. ⚙️

The bottom was where I dwelled during my brief tenure as a turker. I tagged blurry, surveillance-looking photos of construction workers on job sites according to whether they were wearing hard hats or harnesses (1 cent per photo). I helped train a virtual paralegal by describing a hypothetical injury claim (“I suffered a serious injury because a defect in my lawn mower caused it to start”) but earned nothing because the “submit” box never popped up. I imagined myself as an “active investor” and rated the prospect of my supporting a Kickstarter for a device that makes nut milk “extremely likely.” Over the course of several weeks in September, I completed 221 HITs in a little over eight hours of dedicated turking, and earned a grand total of $7.83. That works out to 97 cents an hour. But hourly wages are not everything. Jane Lamont, a 30-year-old call center worker in Louisville, quit her $7.25-an-hour second job at McDonald’s to turk. She works from 7 to 11 on weeknights, five or six hours a day on weekends, and typically makes $5 a day. While the pay is “really low,” she said, she prefers turking to fast food for its freedom — freedom from having to wear a uniform, freedom to spend time at home with her mother, freedom to watch videos between tasks. Besides, she said, she would probably be online anyway — “I like being paid while just being leisurely.” On weekends, she brings her laptop to her boyfriend’s house. While he’s wasting time gaming, she’s making money. “I love it,” Ms. Lamont said. “I feel like that money I can spend on extra things that I want,” like two trips to New York City last year. Katie Boehm of Pittsburgh turned to turking in 2017 after her husband, who has diabetes, lost his job and insurance coverage. Her own health issues keep her from working outside the house, and turking seemed like a lifeline. She turks at least 50 hours a week, sets herself a minimum goal of $20 a day and usually makes $30 to $50. Her husband’s insulin costs $1,500 a month. “MTurk covers about half of what he needs to survive,” Ms. Boehm, 40, said. “Silly insulin.” ⚙️

Amazon claims a turking work force of half a million, but independent researchers say the number of active turkers is smaller. An N.Y.U. data scientist who studies Mechanical Turk, Panos Ipeirotis, estimates that there are from 100,000 to 200,000 turkers, and that at any moment several thousand are doing tasks. The vast majority of turkers are believed to be in the United States — at least three-quarters, researchers say — with India a distant second. Mechanical Turk was created to solve an in-house problem. In 2001, looking for help weeding out duplicate product listings, Amazon applied for a patent for “a hybrid machine/human computing arrangement which advantageously involves humans to assist a computer to solve particular tasks.” The name was a homage to a contraption built by a Hungarian nobleman, featuring a bearded mannequin in a turban, that dazzled Europe with its chess-playing expertise. The moves were actually executed by a magnet-wielding human hidden beneath the board. Mechanical Turk opened to the public in 2005 with considerable fanfare. “Market forces will define how effective it is for requesters and how lucrative it is for workers,” an Amazon executive, Peter Cohen, said at the time. One requester I talked to has found MTurk quite effective. For a year, Ryan Schefke, the founder of a Texas company called Lead Liaison, has used turkers to transcribe business cards that salespeople collect at events. The contacts go into a database of sales prospects, a process known as “lead capture.” Advertisement Multiple turkers transcribe the cards to yield 99 percent accuracy, and the turnaround from the moment a customer scans a card is 10 to 12 minutes, Mr. Schefke said. A turker is paid 3 cents per card. “Basically it’s set it and forget it,” he said. “It’s awesome.” I mentioned that the one Lead Liaison task I did, transcribing a card covered in handwriting, took me 84 seconds, yielding an effective hourly wage of $1.29, and asked whether that was an issue for him. “I don’t know why it would be relevant to us as a business,” he said. “The pay is per task, not hourly, and if a turker did one card and then went off to pick cotton in the field, that’s up to them. I actually think that’s pretty good wages. If you look at people in the Philippines or some other countries, it’s pretty good pay.” The minimum wage in Metro Manila is $1.17. Many major corporations have availed themselves of Mechanical Turk. The New York Times Company has used turkers for at least three data projects. MTurk also has big fans in the social sciences. Over 50,000 academic studies are conducted using MTurk each year, according to Leib Litman, a founder of CloudResearch, a company that helps researchers use the platform. Turking is not always low-paying. The most proficient turkers make upward of $12 an hour, using computer scripts and free tools like HIT Catcher and HIT Forker to beat their fellow turkers to the sweetest HITs and racking up special qualifications that open the door to higher pay. Dr. Litman said that a small cadre of super-turkers actually do most of the tasks on MTurk and estimated that the average wage for turkers who take part in studies run with CloudResearch at $6.50 an hour. ⚙️

Amber Smoot is good at turking. She sits on the porch of her future in-laws’ house in Middleburg, Fla., and runs HIT Forker in the background while she watches her dogs play. When the script catches a task that pays a dollar or more, her computer blasts a snippet of operatic rock and she grabs the HIT and sets it aside until she has a bunch. “I’ll queue ’em up and kick ’em all out,” she said. Ms. Smoot, 32, doesn’t depend on MTurk to survive, but she knows that many people do. She spends a lot of time on message boards that offer tips to rookies. “I love MTurk and I love the opportunities it gives people — it’s great for what it is, a side gig,” she said. “But the state of America is that people are turning to something that shouldn’t be a job and trying to make a living off it.” Most turkers are relatively young — the majority who answered the Pew survey were under 32 years old — but some are older. Jeff Archacki of Corvallis, Ore., is 60 and a former I.T. worker and computer store owner. Since 2014, he has gotten by on disability payments for a hand injury, and turking. He sits at the computer from 2 a.m. to noon, doing crossword puzzles while waiting for good HITs, and typically makes around $40 a day. “I don’t live a lavish lifestyle,” he said, “but I’m not going to the food bank or anything.” ⚙️

Ms. Milland, the turker advocate, said the biggest problem on MTurk was that requesters could decline to pay turkers by “rejecting” their submissions, but still keep the work. “I’ve known a requester to be open about the fact that they automatically reject 10 percent of jobs to pay for Amazon fees,” she said. Turkers have little recourse in dealing with shady requesters. Often, they have no idea for whom they’re working. Many requesters operate under generic, untraceable names like “Events” or “Panel” or “David” or “Josh.” The task where I rated the patriotic quotients of photographs was posted by an outfit called Vision. I graded eight sets for Vision. At 5 cents per set, I should have made 40 cents. But Vision shortchanged me 15 cents. I clicked “Contact Requester” and asked Vision to email me, twice. I never heard back. Advertisement What was I to do? According to a Mechanical Turk help page, it wasn’t Amazon’s problem. “If you have questions about the instructions in a particular HIT, completing a HIT, or why your HIT was rejected, contact the requester,” it says. “Please note that requesters determine when your HITs are approved.” For another requester, I transcribed handwritten disability findings. One contained the patient’s name, describing him as “fully disabled” and “unable to sit/stand for more than 90 minutes w/o pain.” Why was this presumably confidential patient information posted on Mechanical Turk, a platform open to anyone with access to an email address? The requester, p9r, did not respond to my “Contact Requester” query. Searching the p9r website for direct contact information, I found only the physical address of a public high school in Portland, Ore. A receptionist and a business teacher there said they knew nothing of p9r. Weeks later, p9r wrote back, but when I said I was a reporter, I was ghosted again. (Amazon has made one recent effort toward transparency. Since July, it has listed requesters’ approval rates — valuable information for a turker who is deciding whether to do a task.) ⚙️

Another occupational hazard of turking is HITs that contain graphic imagery. A few years ago, Ms. Milland did some work describing photos circulated by the Islamic State. “You have to digest the content of the image in order to come up with the keywords,” she wrote in an email. “Things like ‘orange jumpsuit,’ ‘caged prisoner,’ ‘prisoner on fire,’ ‘kneeling on explosives,’ ‘basket full of heads.’” The job paid 10 cents a photo. A few months ago, a turker who uses the screen name sprinkles123 did a HIT for a legal-services company that uses turkers as mock jurors. It involved a car-crash victim with multiple amputations and severe burns. “The case had a lot of pictures and I didn’t even finish the HIT,” sprinkles123 said in a direct message. “I still think about it and wish I hadn’t opened it.” Such HITs are rare and usually come with warnings, and a turker always has the option not to complete a HIT, but turkers tend to finish what they start. Professor Ipeirotis of N.Y.U. said his research indicated that Amazon itself was one of the biggest requesters and that it posted tasks under many different aliases. Amazon refused to say whether it posts tasks on Mechanical Turk. On the $200 billion Amazon scale of things, Mechanical Turk is a tiny operation. Still, Professor Ipeirotis said he believed that more than $100 million worth of tasks were done on Mechanical Turk annually, of which Amazon’s take would be tens of millions. Turking can be deadly tedious one minute, deliriously random the next. Recently on a Reddit forum, a turker named Mohammed Talukder posted something like a prose poem about the turking life: I don’t even know why I’m doing it I think MTurk is making me crazy following dots with my eyes ..looking at kids starving.. asking me about hotel stays..telling me to bring up past experiences of trauma … judging faces so so so many faces … watching video clips about people stealing … judging the calories for foods..is this a cat or a dog? ⚙️"

Or, they might just find themselves entirely superfluous in an already crowded field.

“We have several moderates in the campaign now, but they’ve not been able to fill the lane,” said Marlon Kimpson, a state senator in South Carolina who has been hosting town hall-style events with presidential candidates. “Now, you’ve got all these people wanting to dip their toe in the water and test the likelihood that they can fill this role.”

Mr. Kimpson said Mr. Biden was still the most natural option for moderate voters, but warned that voters “don’t seem to be very motivated about his candidacy.” He said he was skeptical that either Mr. Bloomberg or Mr. Patrick could do better with such a delayed start, though he considered Mr. Patrick as by far the more intriguing option.

“I think Deval Patrick makes an excellent candidate, however, I am very, very concerned that he simply will not have enough time to make the case in the state of South Carolina,” Mr. Kimpson said, adding of Mr. Bloomberg, “We are familiar with him, but there doesn’t appear to me to be any excitement about his potential.”

Among the other Democratic campaigns, there is more confusion than consensus about what effect Mr. Patrick and Mr. Bloomberg might have on the primary, beyond straining the fund-raising efforts of other candidates who appeal to the business community. That could be an acute challenge for Mr. Biden, the only leading candidate who has been facing a significant cash crunch in recent months, as well as all of the less-prominent candidates hoping for a late breakthrough.

Neither of the two newcomers has done anything to build an operation in the early primary states, and Mr. Bloomberg has indicated he plans to skip those four February contests entirely. Any major effect they will have on the nomination fight would likely come in the states that vote after Iowa and New Hampshire, where the race is less defined."

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: As they lobbied the Trump administration for a $1.5 trillion tax cut, corporations promised that they would invest the savings right back into the U.S. economy. Jim Tankersley investigates whether that actually happened. It’s Tuesday, November 19.

archived recording (donald trump) To all Americans, I say it’s time for change and time for leadership. Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. We’re going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, even —

jim tankersley

Throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump had promised he was going to cut taxes.

archived recording (donald trump) We are proposing major tax relief for the middle class and lowering the business tax from 35 percent all the way down to 15 percent.

jim tankersley

Big tax cuts for individuals, and especially for businesses, which he said was going to revitalize the American economy as a big part of his economic program.

archived recording (donald trump) And you will see companies expand, companies come back into our country, companies not leave our country anymore because taxes and regulations are so onerous.

jim tankersley

It’s one of his top priorities. He gets into office. His team starts working on it. But it’s not what they do first in Congress.

michsel barbaro

Mm-hmm.

archived recording (donald trump) Finally, we want a very big tax cut, but cannot do that until we keep our promise to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.

jim tankersley

What they try to do first is repeal Obamacare.

archived recording This morning, Republicans are fighting to pass a new health care plan. Right now, House Republicans just don’t have enough votes to pass the replacement to Obamacare.

jim tankersley

And in the spring of 2017, that effort is not going well, and neither is Trump’s tax plan.

[music]

michael barbaro

Why not?

jim tankersley

Well, the version of the tax bill that Republicans are working on has some big opponents in the business community. And there’s a real question over whether they can actually craft a bill that passes muster with enough folks in Congress, and with the business community, and makes it all the way to President Trump’s desk, and he’ll sign it.

michael barbaro

Right. I remember this feeling like a perilous moment for this young presidency. It’s struggling to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and it is struggling to convince people to support its tax cuts.

jim tankersley

Right.

archived recording 1 There is a lot of discord within the Republican Party as to what works when it comes to tax reform and when it comes to health care. archived recording 2 Six months into his term, he has exactly zero big legislative accomplishments to boast about.

jim tankersley

If there’s one thing you would have expected a Republican president with Republican majorities to be able to do, it’s pass a big tax cut.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

jim tankersley

And yeah, we’re at this moment in the spring when that looks like that might not happen. And into the breach of that steps Fred Smith.

michael barbaro

And who is Fred Smith?

jim tankersley

Fred Smith is a former Marine who went to Yale and wrote a famous paper in a class that imagines a new type of company that is so wild in its imagination that he gets a C on the paper.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS]

jim tankersley

But he turns around and takes the basis of what he has sketched out on the paper into a company, and builds it into FedEx —

archived recording America, you’ve got a new airline. There’s no first class, no meals, no movies — in fact, no passengers, just packages.

jim tankersley

— this enormous, multinational shipping conglomerate and delivery company.

archived recording Federal Express, a whole new airline of packages only.

michael barbaro

And how exactly does the founder of FedEx, Fred Smith, get involved in this?

jim tankersley

Well, he has been an advocate for lower corporate tax rates for a really long time. And now he sees this opportunity with President Trump, a real ally of corporate tax cuts in the White House, to push this plan he’s been working on for years. And he does something more than just push the idea of tax cuts into the public discourse. He and his team at FedEx actually write their own plan —

michael barbaro

Wow.

jim tankersley

— their own tax proposal.

michael barbaro

And what’s in this Fred Smith plan?

jim tankersley

The FedEx plan is really centered around a big cut in the corporate tax rate, from 35 percent to 20 percent, and some extra carrots for businesses to be able to write new investments off their taxes right away, so two things that Fred Smith and a lot of other executives say are going to spur a renaissance of business investment in America.

archived recording (frederick smith) The fundamental problem with the U.S. tax code is that it punishes investment.

jim tankersley

The argument is that the United States was being held back in its economy by a lack of business investment —

archived recording (frederick smith) And at the end of the day, investment is what produces high-paying jobs.

jim tankersley

— that companies just weren’t spending money that they were sitting on, basically, and they weren’t spending it on capital spending that economists see as very important to economic growth.

archived recording (frederick smith) If you make the United States a better place to invest, there is no question in my mind that we would see a renaissance of capital investment, a growth in G.D.P. and an increase in an income for our blue-collar workforce in the United States.

michael barbaro

What kind of investments is Fred Smith talking about? When we talk about capital investments, what do we mean?

jim tankersley

We’re talking about plants. We’re talking about equipment. In FedEx’s case, we’re talking about airplanes or a transportation hub or new technologies that can help to deliver or sort packages faster. So something that can help you make your business run more efficiently — that’s the kind of thing that economists think of as big, productive capital investments.

michael barbaro

Got it. And the reason that would help the rest of the economy is someone has to build that plant, someone has to build that plane. It just ripples across.

jim tankersley

It ripples across for a couple of reasons. One, it creates demand for those products that are being invested in, which, yes, need to be built, and need to be installed or flown or whatever. But the other real argument is that having these new technologies put in place helps workers do more.

archived recording (frederick smith) Investment is the only way to make blue-collar workers, people that don’t have college degrees, more productive and have more income. So you can hire six people to move a pile of dirt, or you can hire one person with a bulldozer. The difference is the bulldozer. The bulldozer driver makes a lot more money than the people with the shovels.

jim tankersley

And the argument was that companies weren’t doing that because their profits were taxed too heavily. And it was more profitable for them to invest in other countries than in the United States because America’s tax rates weren’t competitive.

archived recording (frederick smith) It’s just like us playing basketball. And on our end of the court we’re playing with a 12-foot basket, and everybody else that we compete with around the world is shooting on a 10-foot basket.

jim tankersley

Fred Smith makes this very clear promise, saying, if we cut corporate tax rates, businesses are going to start investing again in America, and the economy is going to grow faster. And that’s going to help workers and everyone.

michael barbaro

Jim, how skeptical are people of the Fred Smith school of thinking here, that big corporate tax cuts will lead to big investments in the economy and to a lot of growth in the U.S.?

jim tankersley

Well, a huge part of Washington is not skeptical at all. They are pushing this. The Trump administration, Republicans in Congress, many sort of economists who support tax reform are arguing to one degree or another that there will be more investment, lots more, if you just cut the corporate tax rate. There is, though, this dissenting group, including a lot of Democrats and liberal economists, who make the argument that, hey, companies have a lot of money. They don’t need lower taxes to have just a little bit more money to invest it. If they want to invest it, they can. It’s sitting right there on their balance sheets. And cutting their taxes is not going to dramatically increase investment because that’s not what’s holding them back.

michael barbaro

And I’m curious, Jim, how much was FedEx paying in corporate taxes at the time that Fred Smith was making this argument?

jim tankersley

So throughout the time that he’s making this argument, FedEx is paying what it calls in its financial filings an effective tax rate of about 33 percent or 34 percent, which is a lot. In just the fiscal year 2017 alone, it paid more than $1.5 billion in taxes.

michael barbaro

So that’s a meaningful tax bill.

jim tankersley

It’s a meaningful tax bill. And it’s close to the top corporate tax rate in America, which is 35 percent before the Trump tax cuts passed.

michael barbaro

So what happens to the Fred Smith tax plan?

jim tankersley

The tax plan arrives in Washington and gets a warm reception, and it injects energy in what had been a little bit of a stalled process.

[music]

archived recording Brightening prospects of a major tax cut, especially for corporations.

jim tankersley

And it helps open the door again for all of the champions of tax reform to work together for a new bill.

archived recording (donald trump) And as a Christmas gift to all of our hardworking families, we hope Congress will pass massive tax cuts for the American people.

jim tankersley

So Republicans get back on track on the tax bill, particularly spurred on by the fact that they fail completely to repeal the Affordable Care Act. So now this is it. The business community is back on board, they’re lobbying hard. The Trump administration is working key details out with congressional negotiators.

archived recording President Trump is heading to Capitol Hill today to boost momentum for the tax reform bill that could become his first legislative victory.

jim tankersley

We enter the fall. The House passes a version of the bill.

archived recording Debate is still happening on the Senate floor. But this bill does appear to be gaining momentum.

jim tankersley

The Senate narrowly passes a version of the bill, with no Democrats supporting it. And then they put them together, and the final proposal includes the really big corporate rate cut. Basically, just like what Fred Smith and FedEx have proposed.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

jim tankersley

And it includes a bunch of other incentives for investment, also like FedEx had proposed.

michael barbaro

And then, of course, the bill passes.

jim tankersley

The bill passes. I do vaguely recall in my fever dreams from that time period of working 20-hour days that the bill did pass.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS]

jim tankersley

And the president did sign it into law.

archived recording (donald trump) The corporate tax rate, as you know, will be lowered from 35 percent to 21 percent. That means that more products will be made in the U.S.A. A lot of things are going to be happening in the U.S.A. We’re going to bring back our companies. They’ve already started coming back. I think they had a certain confidence in me. They figured we were going to get this done.

jim tankersley

This law includes individual tax cuts. It includes some other provisions. But the centerpiece, the thing it was sold on, was the idea that it would reinvigorate economic growth in America. And it would do that by supercharging business investment. It’s almost hard to understate just how often and vocally Republicans and the president made that case to voters, that this is what American business and the American economy needed for more domestic investment.

michael barbaro

So once this bill passes, what is FedEx’s tax bill? How much does it save?

jim tankersley

So the bill passes. And FedEx files financial statements for the fiscal year 2018 at the end of the year. And it shows that rather than paying $1.5 billion, like it paid the last year, it actually was owed money by the government. It has a negative effective tax rate.

michael barbaro

What?

jim tankersley

Yeah, negative 5 percent.

michael barbaro

So less than zero.

jim tankersley

Less than zero.

michael barbaro

Wow. And how much of that savings, $1.5 plus billion, is attributable to this tax bill?

jim tankersley

All of it. Over the first two years after the tax law, we can count $1.6 billion.

michael barbaro

Hmm. So that’s a pretty staggering figure. But then again, we know that FedEx plans to use that money to reinvest in the American economy.

jim tankersley

So that’s the story that FedEx told before the law passed.

[music]

But the story that played out is different.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So Jim, what happened with all this money that FedEx saved from this tax cut that it played such a huge role in shaping?

jim tankersley

FedEx had said, up to the eve of the bill being signed, that they were going to use the money to increase investment. But they didn’t. Investment actually went down compared to what they had projected. And then the next year, it went down again.

michael barbaro

Hmm. So what did FedEx do with these savings if they were not investing it in the kind of things that we all thought they would?

jim tankersley

Well, it largely rewarded its shareholders. It increased dividends, which is the money it regularly pays people who own its stock. And it bought back shares of that stock, which has the effect of pushing up prices of the stock for the people who own it. Now, to be clear, it did some good things for its workers, too. It accelerated some raises. It increased the size of its workforce. It made a large contribution to its pension plan. But the big winner were shareholders. And that’s a group that is largely, if you look at who owns stock in America, skewed toward the very wealthy.

michael barbaro

So the promise that FedEx made, that they would invest much of the savings from this tax cut into the kind of projects that would benefit everyday workers across the economy — instead, the benefit of the way they used this money really went to people who are largely already pretty well-off.

jim tankersley

In the short term, that seems very clear.

michael barbaro

Why do you think that FedEx did that?

jim tankersley

I had a lot of questions for FedEx about how they spent their tax money. I tried to ask some of the executives over a period of a couple months. I was never granted an interview with an executive. I sent very detailed questions, including one very similar to the one you just asked. Most of them went unanswered. I would love to hear FedEx’s explanation of how it has made the decisions it’s made with its tax cut windfall.

michael barbaro

Hmm. Jim, how typical was this for companies that received these big savings from the tax cuts, that they did not use it to invest, and instead they used it to buy back shares or pay dividends?

jim tankersley

It was very typical. My colleagues and I did a few different analyses to sort of demonstrate just how widespread this type of behavior was. And here’s a few ways of looking at it. One is that companies increased share buybacks and dividends by about triple as much as they increased investment following the tax cuts.

michael barbaro

Wow.

jim tankersley

Another is that investment has now grown more slowly since the tax cuts under President Trump than it grew before the tax cuts under President Trump.

michael barbaro

Which is another way of saying that the central claim of the tax cuts, and how they would be used, and how it would benefit the economy, that has just not come to pass.

jim tankersley

It is not.

michael barbaro

Jim, if these companies were to call you back, and you were able to ask what their thinking was, would there be an argument from a company like FedEx about why the way it chose to use this money is wise and will benefit the American economy?

jim tankersley

Absolutely. The argument goes like this. First off, rewarding shareholders is just another way to increase investment. Because those shareholders will use that money to invest in different companies, who will use that money productively. The other argument is that it’s just too soon to tell the effects of tax cuts on investment, that basically what changes for companies when you cut their tax rate is not, oh, they get a bunch of money today. It’s that investments tomorrow pay off even more. Because the profits you get back, you pay less taxes on. And so we would expect over time to see more investment, not right away.

michael barbaro

Is there any truth to that? Are these arguments from the companies about how they use this money accurate, that it eventually will really help the economy?

jim tankersley

I think there are mechanical truths that you can see to those arguments. But it’s also true that this is all really complicated, and that this was sold as a very simple relationship. Cut the taxes, investment will increase. And just the fact that we’re not seeing that happen right away flies in the face of the arguments that were used to sell the bill. I think that’s really important here, is that, yes, it may be true that investment over time is slightly more competitive in America because of a reduction in marginal business tax rates. But that was not what President Trump stood up at rallies and talked about. He talked about growing the American economy by 3, 4, 5, 6 percent a year because of all this flood of investment coming back to the United States. And we just don’t see it.

michael barbaro

Jim, why is this important, at the end of the day? I mean, these companies successfully lobbied for a tax cut. They got it. It’s their money. Theoretically, can’t they just do what they want to do with it, whatever that is?

jim tankersley

I think it’s important to hold politicians and their supporters accountable for the promises they make, particularly when those promises have real-world implications. The economy is not performing as well as we were promised it would when the tax cuts were passed. It’s not growing as fast. It doesn’t have as much investment. And if you believe the arguments that were made to sell this, that’s hurting workers. Because slower growth is keeping their incomes from rising as fast as they should be. So real people are suffering from not having that additional growth that they were promised they would have and now don’t. A then there’s this one last thing, which is this all comes at a cost. It’s not free to just give money back to corporations by cutting their tax bills. Despite what the proponents said, which was that the law would pay for itself — the additional growth — what we’re actually seeing is a massive, hundreds-of-billions-of-dollars-a-year effect to grow the federal budget deficit. And last year, that deficit came very close to topping $1 trillion.

michael barbaro

And how big a role is the tax cut playing in that ballooning deficit?

jim tankersley

It is the primary driver of additional deficits beyond what we had already before the law was passed.

In a statement, FedEx criticized the Times reporting about its tax savings and investments, but offered no specific factual objections. In the statement, the company’s founder and C.E.O., Fred Smith, challenged the publisher of The Times to a public debate about federal tax policy in Washington.

It’s been a rough couple of weeks for the confidence of Democratic voters. Joe Biden continues to look unsteady on the campaign trail. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren look much better, but they also haven’t shown much interest in appealing to voters beyond their base, which has left a substantial number of Democrats anxious about their ability to beat President Trump next year.

This anxiety has lured Deval Patrick — the two-term former Massachusetts governor and longtime friend of Barack Obama — to enter the race. Patrick is getting a very late start and acknowledged he is a long shot. But he does have a plausible path, as I lay out on the new episode of “The Argument” podcast.

He has the classic advantages of a governor, who can speak in broad terms, rather than the minutiae that senators often fall into. (Sanders and Warren, to their credit, are also good at speaking thematically.) Patrick is casting himself as a sunny progressive who wants to work with others, which is an image that appeals to a large number of Democratic voters."

My job was to rate it on a scale of 1 to 5 for 23 different qualities: “patriotic,” “elitist,” “reassuring” and so on. I did the same for a photo of a woman wearing headphones — I gave her a 4 for “competent” and a 1 for “threatening” — and another of five smiling women flanking a smiling man in a blue windbreaker. I submitted my answers. I checked the clock. Three minutes had passed. I had just earned another 5 cents on a digital work marketplace run by Amazon called Mechanical Turk. At least I thought I had. Weeks later, I’m still not sure. There are lots of ways to make a little money in this world. Amazon Mechanical Turk, which since 2005 has flourished, to varying degrees, in an obscure corner of the globe-striding behemoth’s empire, offers an uncertain, mystifying and often maddening way to make very, very little money. On Mechanical Turk — named for a chess-playing “machine” from the 18th century that concealed a living chess master — scores of thousands of humans earn pennies or dollars doing tasks that computers cannot yet easily do. It works like this: Employers, known as requesters, post batches of what are called Human Intelligence Tasks, or HITs, on Mechanical Turk’s website. A task could be transcribing an invoice, or taking part in a study, or labeling photographs to train an artificial intelligence program. (Occasionally a photo shows something disturbing, like a beheading.) Freelance workers, known informally as turkers, race to grab and do the tasks, providing what Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, once called “artificial artificial intelligence.” Most tasks pay a dime or less, and there is a daily churn of tasks that pay only a penny. And the weird thing is that workers — mostly American workers — will do them, for many different reasons. People turk to save for a motorcycle. They turk to buy insulin. They turk to pay off debt or pass the time profitably while on the clock at a boring job. Some do it because there are few decent-paying jobs that can be done at will. People who are confined to their homes by disability or social anxiety or who live where there are few jobs do it because, despite lousy wages, it seems like the best option. Plenty turk full time. In a 2016 Pew Research Center survey of nearly 3,000 American turkers, a quarter said they made most or all of their earned income on the platform. More than half the turkers surveyed said they earned under $5 an hour. ⚙️ Try Your Hand at Turking Throughout this story we’ll give you the chance to do HITs (Human Intelligence Tasks) that The Times has devised based on ones that novice workers like me encounter on Mechanical Turk.

As little as turking appears to pay on paper, in practice it often pays less because MTurk, as it is known, is a sloppy, shoddy free-for-all. Turkers spend their time fighting requesters over an unfair 10-cent rejection or a missing 60-cent payment. They waste minutes filling out bubbles on defective questionnaires that cannot be submitted. They abandon “10-minute” surveys after half an hour. They swap horror stories and warnings on turker message boards (“rejection on a $0.50 hit,” read one recent bulletin, “reason is ‘funds were not allocated’”). They leave scathing reviews on the turker-run site Turkopticon (“unfair and wild use of the rejection button”). Just how much turkers make is the subject of considerable scholarly debate, but one paper published last year analyzed millions of tasks done by thousands of turkers. Though they probably overrepresented novice turkers like me who do the lowest-paying tasks, the paper’s authors concluded that if you count time spent looking for tasks and working on tasks that came to nothing, the median turker’s hourly wage was $1.77. Only 4 percent of turkers, the researchers found, made more than the federal minimum wage, $7.25 an hour. Advertisement Presiding over this production is the world’s biggest tech company, feet firmly planted on the sidelines. Amazon usually declines to get involved when turkers say requesters rip them off, even as it lets requesters hide behind aliases that can make them impossible to track down. It has ignored turkers’ pleas to mandate higher wages, even as it takes a cut of each transaction ranging from 17 to 50 percent; a requester posting a 1-cent HIT pays one penny to the turker and another to Amazon. Amazon even finds ways to recoup some of the pennies turkers earn, a reminder of the days when miners were paid in scrip redeemable only at the company store. While American turkers can get their wages direct-deposited, thousands of turkers overseas have only one way to get paid without incurring third-party fees: on an Amazon gift card. While Amazon pays all of its American employees at least $15 an hour and favors raising the minimum wage, the company declined numerous requests to comment about the pay policy for turkers or anything else regarding Mechanical Turk. Minimum-wage laws generally do not apply to piecework jobs like turking. Mechanical Turk is now one of a handful of big players in the field known as crowdwork or microwork. (One crowdwork company, Prolific, used by academic researchers, enforces a minimum wage: $6.50 an hour.) Crowdwork’s proponents see a gleaming future — a borderless, no-overhead labor market where task-creator and task-doer meet at the intersection of supply and demand. Its critics see a throwback to something more Dickensian, where the lack of regulation and accountability keeps workers in the dark and on the defensive. Mechanical Turk, in particular, combines the inconsistency and precariousness of gig work with Big Tech’s tendency to dodge liability for the icky things that happen on its platforms. “This is a great little microcosm of what happens when you take away any rules and the wages fall to the bottom,” said Kristy Milland, a former turker turned labor activist who was one of the authors of the paper that analyzed turkers’ earnings. ⚙️

The bottom was where I dwelled during my brief tenure as a turker. I tagged blurry, surveillance-looking photos of construction workers on job sites according to whether they were wearing hard hats or harnesses (1 cent per photo). I helped train a virtual paralegal by describing a hypothetical injury claim (“I suffered a serious injury because a defect in my lawn mower caused it to start”) but earned nothing because the “submit” box never popped up. I imagined myself as an “active investor” and rated the prospect of my supporting a Kickstarter for a device that makes nut milk “extremely likely.” Over the course of several weeks in September, I completed 221 HITs in a little over eight hours of dedicated turking, and earned a grand total of $7.83. That works out to 97 cents an hour. But hourly wages are not everything. Jane Lamont, a 30-year-old call center worker in Louisville, quit her $7.25-an-hour second job at McDonald’s to turk. She works from 7 to 11 on weeknights, five or six hours a day on weekends, and typically makes $5 a day. While the pay is “really low,” she said, she prefers turking to fast food for its freedom — freedom from having to wear a uniform, freedom to spend time at home with her mother, freedom to watch videos between tasks. Besides, she said, she would probably be online anyway — “I like being paid while just being leisurely.” On weekends, she brings her laptop to her boyfriend’s house. While he’s wasting time gaming, she’s making money. “I love it,” Ms. Lamont said. “I feel like that money I can spend on extra things that I want,” like two trips to New York City last year. Katie Boehm of Pittsburgh turned to turking in 2017 after her husband, who has diabetes, lost his job and insurance coverage. Her own health issues keep her from working outside the house, and turking seemed like a lifeline. She turks at least 50 hours a week, sets herself a minimum goal of $20 a day and usually makes $30 to $50. Her husband’s insulin costs $1,500 a month. “MTurk covers about half of what he needs to survive,” Ms. Boehm, 40, said. “Silly insulin.” ⚙️

Amazon claims a turking work force of half a million, but independent researchers say the number of active turkers is smaller. An N.Y.U. data scientist who studies Mechanical Turk, Panos Ipeirotis, estimates that there are from 100,000 to 200,000 turkers, and that at any moment several thousand are doing tasks. The vast majority of turkers are believed to be in the United States — at least three-quarters, researchers say — with India a distant second. Mechanical Turk was created to solve an in-house problem. In 2001, looking for help weeding out duplicate product listings, Amazon applied for a patent for “a hybrid machine/human computing arrangement which advantageously involves humans to assist a computer to solve particular tasks.” The name was a homage to a contraption built by a Hungarian nobleman, featuring a bearded mannequin in a turban, that dazzled Europe with its chess-playing expertise. The moves were actually executed by a magnet-wielding human hidden beneath the board. Mechanical Turk opened to the public in 2005 with considerable fanfare. “Market forces will define how effective it is for requesters and how lucrative it is for workers,” an Amazon executive, Peter Cohen, said at the time. One requester I talked to has found MTurk quite effective. For a year, Ryan Schefke, the founder of a Texas company called Lead Liaison, has used turkers to transcribe business cards that salespeople collect at events. The contacts go into a database of sales prospects, a process known as “lead capture.” Advertisement Multiple turkers transcribe the cards to yield 99 percent accuracy, and the turnaround from the moment a customer scans a card is 10 to 12 minutes, Mr. Schefke said. A turker is paid 3 cents per card. “Basically it’s set it and forget it,” he said. “It’s awesome.” I mentioned that the one Lead Liaison task I did, transcribing a card covered in handwriting, took me 84 seconds, yielding an effective hourly wage of $1.29, and asked whether that was an issue for him. “I don’t know why it would be relevant to us as a business,” he said. “The pay is per task, not hourly, and if a turker did one card and then went off to pick cotton in the field, that’s up to them. I actually think that’s pretty good wages. If you look at people in the Philippines or some other countries, it’s pretty good pay.” The minimum wage in Metro Manila is $1.17. Many major corporations have availed themselves of Mechanical Turk. The New York Times Company has used turkers for at least three data projects. MTurk also has big fans in the social sciences. Over 50,000 academic studies are conducted using MTurk each year, according to Leib Litman, a founder of CloudResearch, a company that helps researchers use the platform. Turking is not always low-paying. The most proficient turkers make upward of $12 an hour, using computer scripts and free tools like HIT Catcher and HIT Forker to beat their fellow turkers to the sweetest HITs and racking up special qualifications that open the door to higher pay. Dr. Litman said that a small cadre of super-turkers actually do most of the tasks on MTurk and estimated that the average wage for turkers who take part in studies run with CloudResearch at $6.50 an hour. ⚙️

Amber Smoot is good at turking. She sits on the porch of her future in-laws’ house in Middleburg, Fla., and runs HIT Forker in the background while she watches her dogs play. When the script catches a task that pays a dollar or more, her computer blasts a snippet of operatic rock and she grabs the HIT and sets it aside until she has a bunch. “I’ll queue ’em up and kick ’em all out,” she said. Ms. Smoot, 32, doesn’t depend on MTurk to survive, but she knows that many people do. She spends a lot of time on message boards that offer tips to rookies. “I love MTurk and I love the opportunities it gives people — it’s great for what it is, a side gig,” she said. “But the state of America is that people are turning to something that shouldn’t be a job and trying to make a living off it.” Most turkers are relatively young — the majority who answered the Pew survey were under 32 years old — but some are older. Jeff Archacki of Corvallis, Ore., is 60 and a former I.T. worker and computer store owner. Since 2014, he has gotten by on disability payments for a hand injury, and turking. He sits at the computer from 2 a.m. to noon, doing crossword puzzles while waiting for good HITs, and typically makes around $40 a day. “I don’t live a lavish lifestyle,” he said, “but I’m not going to the food bank or anything.” ⚙️

Ms. Milland, the turker advocate, said the biggest problem on MTurk was that requesters could decline to pay turkers by “rejecting” their submissions, but still keep the work. “I’ve known a requester to be open about the fact that they automatically reject 10 percent of jobs to pay for Amazon fees,” she said. Turkers have little recourse in dealing with shady requesters. Often, they have no idea for whom they’re working. Many requesters operate under generic, untraceable names like “Events” or “Panel” or “David” or “Josh.” The task where I rated the patriotic quotients of photographs was posted by an outfit called Vision. I graded eight sets for Vision. At 5 cents per set, I should have made 40 cents. But Vision shortchanged me 15 cents. I clicked “Contact Requester” and asked Vision to email me, twice. I never heard back. Advertisement What was I to do? According to a Mechanical Turk help page, it wasn’t Amazon’s problem. “If you have questions about the instructions in a particular HIT, completing a HIT, or why your HIT was rejected, contact the requester,” it says. “Please note that requesters determine when your HITs are approved.” For another requester, I transcribed handwritten disability findings. One contained the patient’s name, describing him as “fully disabled” and “unable to sit/stand for more than 90 minutes w/o pain.” Why was this presumably confidential patient information posted on Mechanical Turk, a platform open to anyone with access to an email address? The requester, p9r, did not respond to my “Contact Requester” query. Searching the p9r website for direct contact information, I found only the physical address of a public high school in Portland, Ore. A receptionist and a business teacher there said they knew nothing of p9r. Weeks later, p9r wrote back, but when I said I was a reporter, I was ghosted again. (Amazon has made one recent effort toward transparency. Since July, it has listed requesters’ approval rates — valuable information for a turker who is deciding whether to do a task.) ⚙️

Another occupational hazard of turking is HITs that contain graphic imagery. A few years ago, Ms. Milland did some work describing photos circulated by the Islamic State. “You have to digest the content of the image in order to come up with the keywords,” she wrote in an email. “Things like ‘orange jumpsuit,’ ‘caged prisoner,’ ‘prisoner on fire,’ ‘kneeling on explosives,’ ‘basket full of heads.’” The job paid 10 cents a photo. A few months ago, a turker who uses the screen name sprinkles123 did a HIT for a legal-services company that uses turkers as mock jurors. It involved a car-crash victim with multiple amputations and severe burns. “The case had a lot of pictures and I didn’t even finish the HIT,” sprinkles123 said in a direct message. “I still think about it and wish I hadn’t opened it.” Such HITs are rare and usually come with warnings, and a turker always has the option not to complete a HIT, but turkers tend to finish what they start. Professor Ipeirotis of N.Y.U. said his research indicated that Amazon itself was one of the biggest requesters and that it posted tasks under many different aliases. Amazon refused to say whether it posts tasks on Mechanical Turk. On the $200 billion Amazon scale of things, Mechanical Turk is a tiny operation. Still, Professor Ipeirotis said he believed that more than $100 million worth of tasks were done on Mechanical Turk annually, of which Amazon’s take would be tens of millions. Turking can be deadly tedious one minute, deliriously random the next. Recently on a Reddit forum, a turker named Mohammed Talukder posted something like a prose poem about the turking life: I don’t even know why I’m doing it I think MTurk is making me crazy following dots with my eyes ..looking at kids starving.. asking me about hotel stays..telling me to bring up past experiences of trauma … judging faces so so so many faces … watching video clips about people stealing … judging the calories for foods..is this a cat or a dog? ⚙️"

Biden Jr. to hold a commanding lead among likely Democratic caucusgoers, according to a new poll from The Des Moines Register and CNN.

The poll showed that Mr. Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., was the first choice for 25 percent of would-be Democratic caucusgoers, a significant increase from the 9 percent he held in September, when The Register last polled the state. The support placed him far ahead of the rest of the field — with the other three top candidates in a virtual tie for second: Ms. Warren at 16 percent and Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders at 15 percent.

The results are the latest evidence of Mr. Buttigieg’s strength in Iowa, where his moderate political views, plain-spoken style and military history have resonated in the early voting state. Since September, when he placed fourth in the Register poll, he has more than doubled his on-the-ground staff to over 100 and has opened more than 20 field offices. He recently completed another bus tour in the state.

Speaking to reporters in Long Beach, Calif., on Saturday night during the state’s Democratic convention, Mr. Buttigieg said the just-released poll numbers were “extremely encouraging.”"

The comments came just a day after Mr. Obama spoke at a forum in Washington, D.C., and warned against Democrats moving too far to the left, particularly on issues such as health care and immigration. While Mr. Obama did not mention any candidate by name, he took aim at the “activist wing” of the Democratic Party and “left-leaning Twitter feeds,” saying they were out of touch with the average voter.

“This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement,” he told an audience of some of the party’s wealthiest donors on Friday evening.

The remarks were a rare departure for Mr. Obama. While the former president has spoken privately with nearly all the candidates, he has been careful to avoid exerting any influence on the race.

Aides said his comments were intended to calm the nerves of Democrats who were worried about the strength of their historically large field, but Mr. Obama ended up reinforcing some of their more pressing concerns.

Some establishment Democrats, elected officials and top donors have fretted that the liberal platforms of Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren would complicate their paths to the general election, arguing that they would lose voters in rural areas and in the suburban districts that helped the party win back the House last year. They are particularly worried about the politics of “Medicare for all,” fearing it could transform health care, an issue that has been a political asset for Democrats, into a liability.

“We’re changing something that clearly is a message that, in 2018, resonated with voters and we’re making the issue about our plan rather than what the president has or has not done,” former Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota said."

She ignored those in the Democratic establishment who had warned her against eliminating private insurance, and ultimately settled on a proposal whose math loosely adds up but that many, even within her party, see as mostly a values statement.

Image A recent round of recent Facebook ads from the Warren campaign featured 12 bullet points of her agenda as president. It did not include Medicare for all.

The transition she announced Friday focuses her first 100 days on a public health insurance plan closer to what her more moderate rivals have championed — drawing instant condemnation that she was trying to have it both ways. “We’re not going to beat Donald Trump next year with double talk on health care,” Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden , said on Friday.

The backlash seemed to ensure that Ms. Warren will face even more pressure to explain her stance in the Democratic debate in Atlanta on Wednesday.

“Up until putting a price tag on Medicare for all she had imposed her will on the primary and dictated the tempo on her terms,” Mr. Lehane said. “This is first time that she is having to react and not follow her campaign script.”

A plan conspicuous by its absence

Ms. Warren had a plan for everything. That was her calling card almost from the start of the race.

“I’m with Bernie on Medicare for all,” she said at the first debate.

But by fall, health care was emerging as the No. 1 issue in the campaign, and the absence of a plan was increasingly untenable. She was dogged for weeks by questions about whom she would raise taxes on, saying only that total costs for the middle class would go down."

Biden Jr. to hold a commanding lead among likely Democratic caucusgoers, according to a new poll from The Des Moines Register and CNN.

The poll showed that Mr. Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., was the first choice for 25 percent of would-be Democratic caucusgoers, a significant increase from the 9 percent he held in September, when The Register last polled the state. The support placed him far ahead of the rest of the field — with the other three top candidates in a virtual tie for second: Ms. Warren at 16 percent and Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders at 15 percent.

The results are the latest evidence of Mr. Buttigieg’s strength in Iowa, where his moderate political views, plain-spoken style and military history have resonated in the early voting state. Since September, when he placed fourth in the Register poll, he has more than doubled his on-the-ground staff to over 100 and has opened more than 20 field offices. He recently completed another bus tour in the state.

Speaking to reporters in Long Beach, Calif., on Saturday night during the state’s Democratic convention, Mr. Buttigieg said the just-released poll numbers were “extremely encouraging.”"

Over the weekend, Democratic presidential candidates swung through Southern California, making their pitches to state party officials in Long Beach and to young voters at California State University Los Angeles.

And as has often been the case in a race marked by an extremely crowded field — and one that has managed to become even more so in recent days — it was telling who showed up and who didn’t.

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. visited Los Angeles Trade Technical College on Thursday, where he slammed Republicans for yielding to the N.R.A. hours after a shooter opened fire at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, but he didn’t attend the party’s convention in Long Beach and didn’t participate in a Univision forum there."

The comments came just a day after Mr. Obama spoke at a forum in Washington, D.C., and warned against Democrats moving too far to the left, particularly on issues such as health care and immigration. While Mr. Obama did not mention any candidate by name, he took aim at the “activist wing” of the Democratic Party and “left-leaning Twitter feeds,” saying they were out of touch with the average voter.

“This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement,” he told an audience of some of the party’s wealthiest donors on Friday evening.

The remarks were a rare departure for Mr. Obama. While the former president has spoken privately with nearly all the candidates, he has been careful to avoid exerting any influence on the race.

Aides said his comments were intended to calm the nerves of Democrats who were worried about the strength of their historically large field, but Mr. Obama ended up reinforcing some of their more pressing concerns.

Some establishment Democrats, elected officials and top donors have fretted that the liberal platforms of Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren would complicate their paths to the general election, arguing that they would lose voters in rural areas and in the suburban districts that helped the party win back the House last year. They are particularly worried about the politics of “Medicare for all,” fearing it could transform health care, an issue that has been a political asset for Democrats, into a liability.

“We’re changing something that clearly is a message that, in 2018, resonated with voters and we’re making the issue about our plan rather than what the president has or has not done,” former Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota said."

Louisiana’s re-elected John Bel Edwards was widely liked, Kentucky’s defeated Matt Bevin widely disliked. Demography probably also mattered. Urban and especially suburban voters have turned hard against Trump, but rural voters haven’t, at least so far — and Mississippi is one of the few states left with a majority-rural population.

But there’s another difference among the three states. Kentucky and Louisiana took advantage of the Affordable Care Act to expand Medicaid, leading to steep drops in the number of uninsured residents; Mississippi hasn’t. This meant that voting Democratic in Kentucky and Louisiana meant voting to preserve past policy success, while the same vote in Mississippi was at best about hope for future reform — a much less powerful motivator.

Back in 2010, as Obamacare was about to squeak through Congress, Nancy Pelosi famously declared, “We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.” This line was willfully misrepresented by Republicans (and some reporters who should have known better) as an admission that there was something underhanded about the way the legislation was enacted. What she meant, however, was that voters wouldn’t fully appreciate the A.C.A. until they experienced its benefits in real life.

It took years to get there, but in the end Pelosi was proved right, as health care became a winning issue for Democrats. In the 2018 midterms and in subsequent state elections, voters punished politicians whom they suspected of wanting to undermine key achievements like protection for pre-existing conditions and, yes, Medicaid expansion.

And this political reality has arguably set the stage for further action. At this point, as far as I can tell, all of the contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination are calling for a significant expansion of the government’s role in health care, although they differ about how far and how fast to go."

She ignored those in the Democratic establishment who had warned her against eliminating private insurance, and ultimately settled on a proposal whose math loosely adds up but that many, even within her party, see as mostly a values statement.

Image A recent round of recent Facebook ads from the Warren campaign featured 12 bullet points of her agenda as president. It did not include Medicare for all.

The transition she announced Friday focuses her first 100 days on a public health insurance plan closer to what her more moderate rivals have championed — drawing instant condemnation that she was trying to have it both ways. “We’re not going to beat Donald Trump next year with double talk on health care,” Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden , said on Friday.

The backlash seemed to ensure that Ms. Warren will face even more pressure to explain her stance in the Democratic debate in Atlanta on Wednesday.

“Up until putting a price tag on Medicare for all she had imposed her will on the primary and dictated the tempo on her terms,” Mr. Lehane said. “This is first time that she is having to react and not follow her campaign script.”

A plan conspicuous by its absence

Ms. Warren had a plan for everything. That was her calling card almost from the start of the race. But health care was conspicuous it its absence, all the way back to her first trip to Iowa, when she barely mentioned Medicare for all.

Once you start taxing certain levels of income without providing additional benefits based on that tax, you are breaking that link.”

As such, the new Democratic approach to Social Security amounts to a test of what affluent liberals are willing to sacrifice to accomplish progressive goals. For a sign of how ostensibly progressive Democrats can recoil at tax changes that affect their pocketbooks, nearly all Democratic senators recently voted to eliminate a cap on the deductibility of state and local taxes. The deductions favor high-income people in high-tax states, and the cap was part of the Republicans’ 2017 tax overhaul.

Elizabeth Warren, who has the most detailed plan, would tax earnings above $250,000 at a 14.8 percent rate, including both the employees’ and employers’ share. This would finance an extra $200 a month in retirement or disability benefits for beneficiaries of Social Security — a 15 percent increase for the average recipient, devised to help lift many retirees out of poverty. It would also expand Social Security benefits for people like widowed spouses and those who worked as caregivers outside the formal work force.

Bernie Sanders would also apply the current 12.4 percent combined Social Security tax rate to all income above $250,000. Joe Biden has pledged to increase benefits and solidify Social Security’s finances without detailing exactly what changes to payroll taxes he would use to do so.

A bill supported by a broad coalition of House Democrats would apply the current tax of 12.4 percent to all earnings above $400,000, and gradually raise the combined rate to 14.8 percent.

Ms. Warren’s proposal hasn’t received as much attention and debate as her proposed wealth tax on families with assets of more than $50 million. But her Social Security plan would affect around seven million Americans, compared with the 75,000 that her advisers estimate would be affected by the wealth tax.

“She will extend the program’s solvency by nearly two decades by asking just the top 2 percent to contribute more,” said Saloni Sharma, a Warren campaign spokeswoman. “She will provide a $200 immediate increase in benefits across the board for every current and future beneficiary — the biggest increase in benefits in nearly 50 years.”"

(One friend said Mr. Obama had brushed off debate criticisms, joking that the eventual winner will “come back to me when they need me.”)

Mr. Obama was initially reluctant to attack Mr. Trump after he left the Oval Office, in part because he wanted to embrace the informal practice adopted by his predecessor, George W. Bush, of not attacking a presidential successor, former aides said. But he was also concerned that going after Mr. Trump would play into Republicans’ hands by prompting a backlash, they added.

By the 2018 midterms, Mr. Obama abandoned that reticence and campaigned aggressively against Mr. Trump, emboldened by the president’s halfhearted response to his attacks.

He also offered vague praise for the large-scale health care policy that Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren are now championing. “Democrats aren’t just running on good old ideas like a higher minimum wage, but they’re running on good new ideas like Medicare for all,” he said in a speech at the University of Illinois in September of 2018.

The big difference now is Mr. Obama’s willingness to publicly criticize others in his party, however indirectly, something he had avoided.

Katie Hill, a spokeswoman for Mr. Obama, said that he was not targeting Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren in his remarks last week, and that his public declarations in support of the Democratic field and a diversity of opinions are the core of his message.

“Since leaving office, President Obama has worked to stay out of the political fray in part to let other, new voices in the Democratic Party rise up,” Ms. Hill said on Wednesday. “Just like in 2018, he’ll be out on the campaign trail next fall working hard for whoever our nominee is.”"

But her Social Security plan would affect around seven million Americans, compared with the 75,000 that her advisers estimate would be affected by the wealth tax.

“She will extend the program’s solvency by nearly two decades by asking just the top 2 percent to contribute more,” said Saloni Sharma, a Warren campaign spokeswoman. “She will provide a $200 immediate increase in benefits across the board for every current and future beneficiary — the biggest increase in benefits in nearly 50 years.”"

Speaking to party donors a day after the latest Democratic primary debate, Mr. Obama added to a series of recent remarks about American politics and the presidential race, including his warning on Friday that the candidates not move too far to the left in their policy proposals and his observation that the average American does not want to “tear down the system.”

Mr. Obama’s comments on Thursday appeared at times aimed more at Democratic officials, activists and donors than at the candidates themselves.

I remember in history class, must have been a junior, it was during the impeachment process of President Clinton or all the scandal, everything that was going on. And I remember the teacher was just kind of riffing on this, and he said, you know, would anybody here ever want to be president or want to run for office, seeing what a mess and what an ugly place Washington was? And I just — maybe involuntarily, my hand went up. And from then on, it became that the running joke of the class that I’d wind up running for president. And then by the time I got to college, they had this Institute of Politics at Harvard, and every day, there’d be a different speaker who would come through. And I remember when I was there as a freshman, people like Donna Brazile who had just come off managing the Gore campaign and Rick Davis, who had done the same thing for McCain. And the former president of Ecuador, he’d been deposed in a coup. You’d just kind of hang around and watch them and see what they were like. The biggest realization was that they’re just people. These people who were shaping the world, people I was seeing on TV were obviously very impressive people, but they were just people. I think it changed my awareness of the fact that, on some level, I could be part of that world, too. But in a very simple sense, especially coming from Indiana, it seemed that it was a choice. You could be in elected office, or you could be an out gay person, not both, at least not where I was from. From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

Pete Buttigieg. It’s Friday, November 22. So Jeremy Peters, you cover politics for The Times, and you’ve been closely tracking Mayor Buttigieg. And in order to better understand the Democratic field of presidential candidates, we’re trying to figure out the most revealing moments in their lives. So when it comes to Pete Buttigieg, what moment should we focus on?

jeremy peters

Well, Mayor Pete has always been a candidate for whom his story, his biography is very central to his appeal to voters, and he’s got a great story to tell. He’s been elected mayor of this medium-sized town in Indiana before turning 30. He has an Ivy League pedigree. He’s been a Rhodes Scholar. He’s worked at a prestigious consulting firm. He’s gone off to Afghanistan as part of the Navy Reserves. So he has all of these components that you kind of think if you’re a voter, wow, he really stands out. There’s something unique about this guy. But at the same time, for most of his adult life, he had this nagging secret, the secret that he couldn’t confront because he thought that it would mean the end to this political career that he had spent so much time perfecting, basically since he went away to college and decided, hey, you know, I can run for president. And he doesn’t see how it’s possible for the politician with the perfect background, the perfect resume to also be open about their sexuality, in his case. So how he reconciles this inner turmoil with his very public ambition I think is a defining moment in his life, if not the defining moment.

michael barbaro

All right. Welcome to the studio.

pete buttigieg

Thank you.

michael barbaro

You’re going to sit there.

pete buttigieg

All right.

jeremy peters

So that story begins in 1982 in South Bend, Indiana where Peter Buttigieg was born.

michael barbaro

Mayor, tell me about the kind of kid that you were, growing up in Indiana?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think I was, safe to say, a little on the nerdy side. I lived in a neighborhood kind of in the middle of South Bend, close to a park where you would have as much as possible what you’d call a prototypical Midwestern kid’s upbringing, you know, playing in the park with friends, a lot of time in the house. I was really interested in baseball cards, but I was more interested in categorizing them than I was in baseball, I think. I loved science and science fiction. I loved reading, plus I was an only child. So I think it’s safe to say I had a lot of interior life going on in a fairly quiet house where it was a dog and my parents, who were both academics, and me.

michael barbaro

What was your introduction to even the idea of politics?

pete buttigieg

Politics was always in the air in our house just because my parents were very politically passionate. They really cared about what was happening. I can remember the Democratic Convention. It must have been 1988.

archived recording NBC News continues its coverage of America’s convention.

pete buttigieg

I would’ve been six years old and my parents explaining what a convention was. I remember Jesse Jackson giving a speech.

archived recording (jesse jackson) When I look out at this convention, I see the face of America — red, yellow, brown, black, and white. We are all precious in God’s sight, the real rainbow coalition.

pete buttigieg

And I remember my parents thinking it was important to watch the Republican Convention, too. I mean, you would stop — even though I don’t it ever crossed their mind to ever vote for a Republican.

archived recording Now let’s go down to the podium. Here is George Herbert Walker Bush addressing his convention.

pete buttigieg

Everything in the house would kind of stop when it was time to watch what was playing out.

archived recording Thank you.

michael barbaro

At what moment in this early phase of your life did you go from just watching this and maybe finding it very fascinating to feeling really drawn to it?

pete buttigieg

Well, when I got to college, it felt like the Republicans and the Democrats, at the time, it’s crazy to think about now, polarized as we are. But what it felt like when I showed up as a freshman on campus was that the two parties were converging and not necessarily in a good place, that you had this kind of center-right and center-left, both of them very committed to growth in business, but it seemed not very committed at all to some of the questions of how we take care of vulnerable people around the country. And I think there’s a moment for any kind of well-spoken or intelligent young person watching the news when you see a senator or a candidate saying something or doing something and you think, well, that’s not right. I could do that. I could do it different. Now, you might be wrong. They might be way more sophisticated than you are, and you can’t see it. Or you might be right, and it might well be the case that what they’re saying is just not right. But I certainly had that feeling reinforced when I saw these figures come to campus, some of whom were extremely impressive, but none of whom seemed like they were on a different plane of existence. They were just people.

michael barbaro

So at this point, a year or two into Harvard, have you made up your mind that you were probably going to find a way to have a career in politics?

pete buttigieg

I knew I wanted a career that involved policy. I don’t think I’d figured out for sure that that meant running. Plus, you know, when I thought about it, even well before I was coming to terms with the fact that I was gay, I knew that I had no political connections at home. I had an unpronounceable name, and I was a Democrat who lived in Indiana. So it was not obvious that I could overcome some of the obstacles toward running. But I think it’s safe to say by the time I graduated, I had some sense that I could see myself doing it.

michael barbaro

Well, I want to talk to you about that realization of your sexuality in particular. Obviously, your candidacy is historic in a couple of different ways, and among those is the fact you’re the first major party presidential candidate who is openly gay. And so I want to ask you about that part of your identity. When did you sense that you were gay? When did that realization start to dawn on you?

pete buttigieg

I think it depends what you mean by realization, right? There are things you could point to going way back, certainly a fascination I had with a classmate when I was about 12 that, in hindsight, is very obviously a crush. But I was not willing to think of it that way, although some part of me must have — I mean, I wasn’t stupid either, right? So you have this kind of awareness that was definitely there by the time I was hitting middle school. But taking a word like gay and applying it to myself, I was still years away from being able to do that, even in my own mind.

michael barbaro

Well, what did you do with those feelings?

pete buttigieg

I guess I packed them up, yeah.

michael barbaro

Packed them up —

pete buttigieg

Not much would be the best answer.

michael barbaro

Pack them up and put them where?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I don’t know how these things work, even in your own mind. I just didn’t explore them. That’s for sure. First of all, there were not a lot of out gay people that I knew as such growing up. I mean, in high school, it was exactly zero. There was just no sense of gay life or a gay community. And when I got to college, that’s when the kind of internal battle was starting to heat up.

michael barbaro

Why?

pete buttigieg

I think because you just can’t escape it. I mean, my god, you’re in college, right? I mean, any feelings you have, especially in the romantic department, are going to start asserting themselves even more fiercely than they have when you get to college. For a lot of people, it’s a big part of what you spend college on.

michael barbaro

Right. So how did you deal with it?

pete buttigieg

Same way I dealt with it up to then, just packed it away. Dated women, remarkable women. Because I enjoyed these relationships, I think I could defer facing the fact that that wasn’t the same as what it was to be in love with somebody.

michael barbaro

And your political ambition was already solid at that point?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I still didn’t know exactly where it would take me or what it would mean, but I think by then, I knew that there was a good chance I was going to be running for office in my adult life. But at that point, I’m still clinging to some kind of hope, however vanishing, that maybe I’m straight or I’m bisexual and I can just not worry about the gay part. I think when I thought about my career, certainly when I talked about my future and how I was going to be involved, I wasn’t even thinking about the possibility that that would come into contact with this developing side of me. But I’m sure to the extent that I thought what it would mean to come to terms with the fact that I was at very least different and, as became increasingly clear, gay, that one of the things that would have kept that in its corner was the simple fact that that didn’t fit with any of the other things I wanted to do in life, not just a career, but a family. I wanted to get married. I wanted to have kids. From my perspective, you could be married and have kids or you could be gay, not both.

michael barbaro

You graduated in 2004. That — correct me if I’m wrong. That’s the year when Massachusetts —

pete buttigieg

That’s right.

michael barbaro

— legalizes gay marriage.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

archived recording The court today, as you know, in a 4-3 advisory opinion to the Senate has a rule that in a November 18, 2003 decision, they meant marriage. They meant equality. They meant that the Commonwealth may no longer deny marriage rights to same-sex couples, including —

michael barbaro

So I say that only to try to understand, are you falling behind the culture, in a sense? Are you ignoring some of the signs that these things are changing?

archived recording Marriage and only marriage will be enough to satisfy the requirements of the Massachusetts Constitution.

pete buttigieg

Well, the thing is I wasn’t from Massachusetts. I was in Massachusetts for a while, but I never felt like I was from there. And nothing against Massachusetts, but I realized pretty quick after turning up at Harvard that I didn’t belong there either.

michael barbaro

Why not?

pete buttigieg

It was just — it was just a different culture. I didn’t realize that. I didn’t realize that I was Midwestern until I left the Midwest. And just little things, cultural things, the way — I don’t know, the way people interact, what’s expected of you. Once I got there, I realized that socially, I was way more Midwestern than I thought.

michael barbaro

So take me from graduating from Harvard to your decision to join the Navy Reserves.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so it starts with 9/11. Actually, it starts before 9/11. There’s this family tradition of serving in the military. There’s a painting hanging on the wall of my parents’ house of a relative, a great uncle who I kind of idolized in theory. He was an Army Air Corps pilot. And so I had this idea, this maybe romantic idea, of being in the military, and then it never really became real. But I remember on 9/11 thinking, oh, well, war isn’t just a thing that happens in other places or in other periods of history. Like, war has come to my generation, and thinking, at least in the back of my head, that that might mean I would be involved, but not taking any steps to do that. But that turned into more and more of a nagging feeling when some friends of mine started to serve. A friend of mine from college shared with me just before we graduated that he had decided to join the Navy Reserve. I was fascinated. And then when I was talking to someone about applying for the Rhodes Scholarship and how I wanted to talk about my interest in public service and to the faculty member who was giving advice to students, and just said, pointedly, like, you might want to really think about how you’re going to say that, knowing that you’re going to be competing against people from the military academies. Oh yeah, that’s true. Like, my chest thumping about caring about public service feels a lot smaller held up against what others are doing.

michael barbaro

Do you think that was one of the things that might have drawn you to military service, knowing that to get a Rhodes, to be in that world, in that league, you know, it might be a good thing?

pete buttigieg

I think definitely that it was part of how you’re true to a culture of service. And also the Kennedy presidency kind of hangs over certainly the Kennedy School, as you might imagine. And that can’t be separated from his military career.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

I mean, really, it was almost an expectation that you would’ve served, up until roughly the time when I came of age when everything shifted.

michael barbaro

An expectation that you would serve —

pete buttigieg

Well, when you’re looking at the history of the people we were studying —

michael barbaro

Of presidents.

pete buttigieg

— who have made history. Yep, as presidents. And then the thing that put me over the top was this experience knocking on doors in Iowa with a couple of buddies from college who went out. We took a week off and rented a car, and it was the last few days before the Iowa caucuses, and we were volunteers for Obama. They sent us to this very rural area, some of the lowest income counties in Iowa. And it felt like any time I met a young — especially young man — it was somebody who was serving or was about to serve. And I started to realize, we had service that used to be something that bridged people together. Now it’s completely different, that if you were rural or low-income, you were highly likely to serve. If you were from a background like mine, which was middle class economically, but I’d had the chance to go to an institution like Harvard, almost nobody with that background was serving. And I began to feel like it wasn’t just this kind of thing I thought about that I hadn’t gotten around to. It was that I was part of the problem. I was part of the divide. That was the thing that kind of propelled me that last few inches toward being ready to yank open the door of the recruiting office in Indiana and say, hey, how do I sign up?

michael barbaro

I wondered, do you think you joined the military in part because you knew what it would mean for a political career?

pete buttigieg

You know, I wrestled with that because as soon as I get that question, there’s a part of me that thinks, if the answer is yes, does that mean the service wasn’t pure in some way? And I remember at the time asking myself if being in the military was as unpopular as it is today popular, would I still do it? And I want to believe the answer is yes, but there’s no way to go back and prove it. I’m not somebody who thinks that it’s, like, a prerequisite that if you want to run for office you need to have served. But I do think if you have a heart for elected office, one way to put your money where your mouth is to have been in that kind of service, too.

michael barbaro

That strikes me as a very candid answer because of course, you could just say, well, of course I would have done it, even if there was no possible —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

— political benefit.

pete buttigieg

And I want to say that. I just can’t prove it.

michael barbaro

So I want to talk about this run for mayor for just a little bit. Whenever you run for office, your character is on display. And at this point, you are keeping something quite elemental about yourself secret. Did it feel like you were hiding something?

pete buttigieg

Not really. The only time it felt that way was when there was small talk about whether I was dating, and I would crack a joke or something. We’d be sitting in a studio like this one and a radio host would ask a question. And I’d say, well, if anybody listening is into economic policy and long walks on the beach, go ahead and reach out and just kind of play the busy single person, which is what I was, except for the fact that I wasn’t actively looking for love. I was going out of my way to avoid it. But if somebody who is straight up asked me on the record, to this day, I’m not sure what I would have done.

michael barbaro

Do you think that that would have potentially cost you the mayoralty, might have kept you from being mayor or staying mayor?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I think there’s a good chance of it. There’s a reason why no — as far as I know, no out gay person had ever run for mayor of any place in Indiana.

michael barbaro

This is a state with strong Christian values, and —

pete buttigieg

— not known for progressive social outlooks on politics. And here I am, rocking up, 29 years old saying, trust me, support me. Never mind this state legislator who has earned tons of credibility in this community. Never mind this county councilman who’s the party favorite. Go with me instead. If there had been anything that looked like a skeleton or a vulnerability, I think it probably would have sunk me before I got anywhere at all.

michael barbaro

So I want to now move into this notion of you reconciling these things.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so when I first joined the Reserve, the message was kind of you’re pretty much going to go to one of these wars, and we’ll let you know which one. And so I knew that, at a certain point, it was coming. And of course, I didn’t want to take office in South Bend without a plan for this. So we had gamed it out with my team, if I get orders, here’s what you do. And when I received my orders and knew I was going for sure, I don’t think even then it occurred to me that it would have much to do with my sexuality. If anything, I was thankful that I was single, right? The hardest thing for people to deploy is the fact that you’re leaving behind somebody you love, in addition to all the professional complications. But then, the more I started getting mentally ready for going over and really thinking about what it meant, the more it started weighing on me that I didn’t have a — wasn’t coming back to a family, my parents, of course, but I wasn’t coming back to a household. And more than that, I had no idea what it was like to be in love. And the idea that I’m — here I am. I’m a grown-ass man. I own a home. I’m the mayor of my city. I’m a military officer. And if I get killed over there, I will go to my grave not knowing what it’s like to be in love. And that just made me realize how untenable the situation I was in really was. And up until then, it didn’t seem untenable, I guess because I was so busy, and I might have deferred coming out and having a dating life forever, if not for this moment where I’m thinking, shit, I could die.

michael barbaro

You wrote a letter I want to ask you about.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, you know, it’s a thing you do. I assume everybody does it. I don’t know. But it’s the thing you do when you go to war, right? You want to make sure that you have the last word on your life and leave a few instructions. So I wrote up a letter, put an envelope, put just in case on the outside. Put it in the desk drawer, would’ve been pretty easy to find if worse comes to worst. And that’s a real moment, too, because you’re sitting there staring at the screen trying to figure out how to give a short accounting of your life.

michael barbaro

And what did you say?

pete buttigieg

Well, what I said was that I wouldn’t want people to think that I’d been cheated, that obviously it’d be terrible if I didn’t come back, but I also had this amazing life where I have wonderful friendships, and I got to serve my community in a way that very few people get to do, let alone at my age, and that I’d had this very fulfilling life. And of course, it’d be too bad if something happened to me, but to keep that in perspective. But if you’re asking if there was, like, P.S. I’m gay, no.

michael barbaro

That’s kind of what I was asking. So you are deployed.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

You do not die.

pete buttigieg

Right.

michael barbaro

You come back, and you’re mayor.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

And how do you decide that it’s time to come out?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think by the time I hit the ground and I was back, I knew that I was going to come out and then it’s just — it was more how and when. I remember resenting the idea that you’re supposed to have to come out, right? Straight people don’t have to come out. Why do I? And then, while I’m in the process of figuring this out —

archived recording Thank you all for coming. It’s been a tough week here in the Hoosier state, but we’re going to move forward.

pete buttigieg

We have this explosive controversy over Mike Pence, the Governor Mike Pence and his so-called Religious Freedom bill.

archived recording The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was about religious liberty, not about discrimination.

pete buttigieg

So suddenly, we’re on national television, my state, as the most officially anti-gay state in the country. I’m fighting him on it, of course, because it’s a terrible policy. But now, I’m fighting this terrible, anti-gay policy putatively from the perspective of a straight ally, wondering whether I’m more effective because people don’t know that I’m gay. And at the same time, knowing that this just kind of speeds things up even more that, like, it’s just a really weird position to be in, to be having all these hypothetical arguments about discrimination against gay people, when it really means me. Meanwhile, this is also the period when we realize that soon the Supreme Court is going to weigh in on marriage. I mean, all of this was happening in that early part of 2015 while I’m wrestling with how to do this. And so oddly enough, it was — — as busy as I was as mayor. Military duty actually felt like, kind of almost like a break because it was eight hour days, 40 hour week. I wasn’t used to having that much time, and so is a lot of time to sit and write and think and call friends and get advice.

michael barbaro

So you produce a plan.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, well I produced a letter, an op-ed I guess.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. What was the essential line that I’m sure you remember that you wrote?

pete buttigieg

I remember saying that it’s just part of who I am and that it has no bearing on how I do my job, that the way I do my — did my job either as an officer or as a mayor or in business had nothing to do with the fact that I was gay and that —

michael barbaro

It still sounds a little defensive.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Or maybe a little scared.

pete buttigieg

Probably. Yeah, I mean, you know, I didn’t feel like I was coming out guns blazing. I felt like I — again, part of me was bothered that I had to share this at all. Then part of me knew that it would do some good if I did, I mean, not just in my own life. That I — my main agenda was, personally, I wanted to get out there and start dating. But also that it would mean something, might mean all kinds of things to a whole bunch of different people when I came out and said this.

We’ll be right back.

archived recording A very personal announcement coming from South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg today. In an essay published in today’s South Bend Tribune, the mayor announced he is gay. Currently in the midst of running for a second term, Pete Buttigieg penned an essay in Tuesday’s South Bend Tribune revealing he was gay. A lot of people wondering why he chose to make this announcement now. It comes just months after the state’s religious freedom law thrust the state into the national debate on gay rights. As for the mayor himself, he says nothing is different, nothing has changed, and his focus is on South Bend.

michael barbaro

I want to talk about the timing, the exact moment of the op-ed because my sense is that at this phase of your career, you’re up for re-election, right? You’ve won the primary. And winning the primary, in a sense, means you’re standing a very good shot of winning.

pete buttigieg

Depending on the year, but yeah, in South Bend, it should be.

michael barbaro

So does that mean you deliberately chose a — like, a safe, low-risk time to do this?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I would think that going into a Democratic primary would be a safer time than going into a general election. And I think also the decision to do this came by way of realizing that there is no such thing as a safe time. I was just done with not having the kind of personal life that I wanted to have.

michael barbaro

So once you come out, how does your personal life change?

pete buttigieg

Well, I started dating, and that kind of changes everything. I mean, I still had this very demanding job. You’re the mayor, and so anybody in town that you ask to have a cup of coffee is —

michael barbaro

It’s a thing.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, it’s a thing. It might be misinterpreted. You could cross some line without meaning to. I mean, most of the people I interacted with were either people who needed something from me, people I needed something from or people who worked for me. So it’s not, like, a very healthy pool for dating is what I’m saying. And I remember thinking there were all these kind of city fathers who, early on in my time as mayor, seemed determined to fix me up with their daughters. And I remember just thinking, like, where are you now? Did none of you have, like, a son or a nephew or something? So I did what millennials do. I went online. Turns out there’s apps for all of this. There was O.K. Cupid, Tinder. The one that actually came through for me was called Hinge. And it’s supposed to serve up people that — I don’t know how the algorithm works. But I find this guy, this cute guy with a big smile, and I’m like, I want to know this guy. So we start chatting. Well, I was chatting with a lot of people, but obviously, he’s the one I remember because that was Chasten.

michael barbaro

Your future husband.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

michael barbaro

So your story, to many people, is particularly compelling one, everything we just discussed. You are a Harvard graduate, a Rhodes Scholar, you’re a veteran. You’re gay. You’re religious. And from your own description of yourself, it feels like you have been thinking about politics and preparing, to some degree, to run for president for a very long time, even though you’re quite young. And I’m sure you understand this and have heard this. That has led to this perception of a person kind of, perhaps, orchestrating a political biography. Do you ever question whether that, no matter what your intention, is — could possibly undermine the power of the story itself, however genuine?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I mean, I think we’re conditioned to not like the idea of somebody who sat around thinking all their lives about how to become president. And I don’t view myself that way, although I get that that story has been written around me. Although, I also don’t know what it is we expect, that somebody kind of gets struck by lightning and then they turn into somebody who might become president. We all have these paths, right, that bring us to where we are. And I think anybody in professional life or even social life thinks about the story that you tell about yourself. At the end of the day, I’m not doing this because I have this personal need to be in elected office or to be the president. I’m not coming at the presidency as a thing that I’d like to occupy. I’m coming at it as this way to do something that I think I’m able to do. And I think it’s helpful in the sense that I could also have a very happy life doing something else. And oddly, I think that — that helps prepare me to do what’s required to do this. And this is advice I give talking to students, too. Imagine somebody is being sworn in, an ambitious, talented person kind of in the middle of their career is being sworn in as an assistant secretary in the State Department for the Middle East. And then imagine if that person has got there one of two ways. In kind of universe A, it’s a person who woke up one day in high school and said, I want to be the assistant secretary for the Middle East, and took the right courses and got the right jobs and had the right fellowships and wrote the right papers and did everything in order to occupy that title. And the other person is somebody who said, I — woke up in high school and said, I want to be the person who makes the United States a force toward peace in the Middle East. And they don’t know what that’s going to mean, and maybe it means they start out becoming an activist or maybe they’re an academic or maybe they’re a civil servant or whatever. But by whatever winding path, they wind up in this job, right? Which of those two scenarios is going to lead to somebody who’s better equipped to take that job they’ve been handed? I’ve got to think it’s the latter. And so what I’ve tried to do in my life is to prepare myself to be useful to others. And yes, I think that, in all likelihood, means in a form that involves holding office or seeking office or at least public life where I speak to lots of people, sometimes millions at the same time. But it’s not about, necessarily, having one title or another. And so I think if you overthink it, that’s where you start to lose the fidelity to what it is that would guide you when you actually get what you’ve been chasing for a long time. Jeremy, what do we learn from Mayor Pete Buttigieg about the way he reconciled his political ambition with this essential fact about himself that he feared would endanger that ambition?

jeremy peters

I think we learn a lot about his decision-making process, not just how he internalizes decisions personally, but how he thinks about them in the longer arc of a political career. And he’s been very intentional all along the way about choosing certain endeavors that he thinks would benefit a long-term political career. Now some people would think, on the one hand, that’s too calculating. I don’t want somebody who’s thought about being president since he was a teenager. And, you know, in the era when voters seemed to prize authenticity in their political figures, they could see that as inauthentic. On the other hand, the decision that he made to wait seems to have borne out to his benefit. I mean, here he is, the first openly gay candidate for president of the United States who has a legitimate shot at being his party’s nominee. Look at where he is in the Democratic primary right now. He’s rocketed to the top of the polls. He’s brought in all this money in large part because he’s gay, and that opened a lot of doors with Democratic donors. He’s heading into the Iowa caucuses in the lead by some measures. But we won’t know if his decision to wait actually was the right one until people start voting. So it seems to have worked out well for him right now, but no one’s cast a single vote. And we don’t know how voters in the Democratic primary are going to react. We certainly don’t know how voters in a general election are going to react. So we’re just not going to know until Democratic voters have their say.

michael barbaro

Mayor, when you think back to your younger self —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Not just your teenage self, but even your college self and your post-collegiate self who was so fearful about telling the world that you were gay, what do you kind of wish you could tell that person, that version of Mayor Buttigieg?

pete buttigieg

Well, back then, I would have thought this other fact, if I dared to unpack it, this fact about my life, this way in which I was different, was the thing that could multiply all the other stuff by zero, in terms of the impact I was going to have in the world, that I might very well choose that path, but that the price would be that I wouldn’t get to make a difference in public life. And if you want proof of God having a sense of humor, one of the things I’m seeing now, especially in the interactions I have on the campaign trail and the fact that this campaign is historic in a lot of ways, is that that same fact that I thought would mean never getting to this point might actually be one of the things that makes it matter the most.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

It’s a strange thing to think about that the one thing that I couldn’t control, the one thing that might have meant that it would be better not to have any aspirations related to politics at all could be the very thing that anchors the moral and emotional purpose of this entire campaign.

michael barbaro

Thank you very much.

pete buttigieg

Thanks for having me.

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (fiona hill) And I did say to him, Ambassador Sondland, Gordon, I think this is all going to blow up, and here we are.

michael barbaro

In the latest public testimony before impeachment investigators, Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert on the National Security Council, recalled her growing frustration with Ambassador Gordon Sondland, as she realized he was pursuing a political agenda in Ukraine on behalf of President Trump.

archived recording (fiona hill) He was being involved in a domestic, political errand, and we were being involved in national security foreign policy and those two things have just diverged.

michael barbaro

Hill testified that when Trump and Sondland pressed Ukraine to investigate the discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, they were playing directly into Russia’s hands, since Russia wants to deflect attention away from its interference.

archived recording (fiona hill) This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves. These fictions are harmful, even if they’re deployed for purely domestic, political purposes.

In previous debates, Ms. Warren avoided saying exactly how she would pay for the … [+1965 chars]",The debate was often a referendum on a politician who has presented a challenge to the party.,2019-11-21,The New York Times,Buttigieg Was a Target. But No One Was Attacked Like Warren.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/opinion/democratic-debate-warren.html,"That criticism, both technical and philosophical, continued in an inevitable segment about Medicare for All with Ms. Warren facing criticism from both her left and right flanks. In previous debates, Ms. Warren avoided saying exactly how she would pay for the tens of trillions in new government spending the health care system she favors would entail. But she recently released both a financing plan and an implementation timeline in which she proposed putting off the push for a full-fledged single-payer system.

That segment opened with Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., touting his own plan, which he calls Medicare for All Who Want It, as a way to avoid the “divisive” step of eliminating most private insurance and forcing most Americans onto a government health care plan. Mr. Biden, similarly, framed his opposition to Ms. Warren’s proposal by saying, “I trust the American people.” Once again, it was an attack not only on Ms. Warren’s plan, but on the political philosophy it represents.

From the other side of the debate, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose Medicare for All bill Ms. Warren backs, implied that he didn’t trust Ms. Warren’s plan to hold off on Medicare for All until late in her first term. Now is the time, he said, practically pounding the podium. “In the first week of my administration, we will introduce Medicare for All.” The message was clear: Warrenism, which would wait until year three to fight for single-payer, was insufficiently devoted to the revolutionary cause.

These exchanges illustrate the Democratic Party’s growing uneasiness with Ms. Warren and her brand of fussy technocratic populism, which can come across as both too radical and too timidly wonky at the same time.

Throughout her campaign, Ms. Warren has attempted to occupy a middle ground between the party’s moderate wing and its progressive base. But her have-it-both-ways strategy may well have backfired. Despite Ms. Warren’s ascension to the primary’s top tier, the steadiness of Mr. Biden’s polling and the recent rise of Mr. Buttigieg in Iowa and New Hampshire — along with the dips in Ms. Warren’s own polling — suggest not only the limits of her strategy but the limitations of the underlying worldview itself."

A timely comeback. A witty one-liner.

At their worst, they were robotic and rambling. Clumsy. Cringe-worthy.

Here are some of the most memorable moments from Wednesday’s Democratic presidential debate in Atlanta, hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post.

Digs at President Trump

“With all due deference to the fact that this is a presidential debate, Donald Trump got punked.”

Senator Kamala Harris of California said President Trump had compromised the checks and balances on North Korea’s nuclear capabilities with his unilateral dealings with the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un.

She said Mr. Trump was the greatest threat to the national security of the United States, pointing to his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement and the Iran nuclear deal, as well as his decision to pull American troops from Northern Syria."

Ms. Warren did not push back, and said she was grateful for Mr. Obamas passage of the Affordable Care Act. But some on the partys left… [+1458 chars]","As Democratic presidential candidates gather to debate on Wednesday night, Barack Obama is increasingly pressing a 2020 message: Focus on defeating President Trump and ditch the ideological purity.",2019-11-20,The New York Times,"Obama Moves Off Political Sidelines, Earlier Than He Expected",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/politics/obama-2020-candidates.html,"The former president’s comments also reflect his own policy legacy, which has come in for modest questioning and criticism at times by some Democrats in the debates and on the campaign trail. (One friend said Mr. Obama had brushed off debate criticisms, joking that the eventual winner will “come back to me when they need me.”)

Mr. Obama was initially reluctant to attack Mr. Trump after he left the Oval Office, in part because he wanted to embrace the informal practice adopted by his predecessor, George W. Bush, of not attacking a presidential successor, former aides said. But he was also concerned that going after Mr. Trump would play into Republicans’ hands by prompting a backlash, they added.

By the 2018 midterms, Mr. Obama abandoned that reticence and campaigned aggressively against Mr. Trump, emboldened by the president’s halfhearted response to his attacks.

He also offered vague praise for the large-scale health care policy that Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren are now championing. “Democrats aren’t just running on good old ideas like a higher minimum wage, but they’re running on good new ideas like Medicare for all,” he said in a speech at the University of Illinois in September of 2018.

The big difference now is Mr. Obama’s willingness to publicly criticize others in his party, however indirectly, something he had avoided.

Katie Hill, a spokeswoman for Mr. Obama, said that he was not targeting Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren in his remarks last week, and that his public declarations in support of the Democratic field and a diversity of opinions are the core of his message.

“Since leaving office, President Obama has worked to stay out of the political fray in part to let other, new voices in the Democratic Party rise up,” Ms. Hill said on Wednesday. “Just like in 2018, he’ll be out on the campaign trail next fall working hard for whoever our nominee is.”"

MODERATOR: Many states, including right here where we are tonight in Georgia, have passed laws that severely limit or outright ban abortion. Right now, Roe v. Wade protects a woman’s right to abortion nationwide. But if Roe gets overturned and abortion access disappears in some states, would you intervene as president to try to bring that access back, Senator Klobuchar?

AMY KLOBUCHAR: Of course. We should codify Roe v. Wade into law. That’s what we should do. And this president indicated early on what he was going to do, and he’s done it. When he was running for office, he literally said women should go to jail, and then he dialed it back and said doctors should go to jail. So no surprise we’re seeing these kinds of laws in Georgia, in Alabama, where his allies are passing these bills. And what we have to remember is that the people are with us. And I predict this will be a big issue in the general election. And I just can’t wait to stand across from Donald Trump and say this to him: “You know what? The people are with us.” Over 70 percent of the people support Roe v. Wade. Over 90 percent of the people support funding for Planned Parenthood and making sure that women can get the health care they need. He is off the track on this, and he will hear from the women of America, and this is how we’re going to win this election.

MODERATOR: Just this weekend, Louisiana re-elected a Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards. He has signed one of the country’s toughest laws restricting abortion. Is there room in the Democratic Party for someone like him? Someone who can win in a deep red state but who does not support abortion rights? Senator Warren.

ELIZABETH WARREN: I believe that abortion rights are human rights. I believe that they are also economic rights. And protecting the right of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body is fundamentally what we do and what we stand for as a Democratic Party. Understand this: When someone makes abortion illegal in America, rich women will still get abortions. It’s just going to fall hard on poor women. It’s going to fall hard on girls, women who don’t even know that they’re pregnant, because they have been molested by an uncle. I want to be an America where everybody has a chance. And I know it can be a hard decision for people. But here’s the thing. When it comes down to that decision, a woman should be able to call on her mother. She should be able to call on her partner. She should be able to call on her priest or her rabbi. But the one entity that should not be in the middle of that decision is the government.

MODERATOR: Senator Warren, I’m going to push you on this a little bit for a specific answer to the question. Gov. John Bel Edwards in Louisiana is an anti-abortion governor who has signed abortion restrictions in Louisiana. Is there room for him in the Democratic Party with these politics?"

Speaking to party donors a day after the latest Democratic primary debate, Mr. Obama added to a series of recent remarks about American politics and the presidential race, including his warning on Friday that the candidates not move too far to the left in their policy proposals and his observation that the average American does not want to “tear down the system.”

Mr. Obama’s comments on Thursday appeared at times aimed more at Democratic officials, activists and donors than at the candidates themselves. Democrats should focus less on the “tactical disagreements” among the candidates, Mr. Obama said, and avoid making false choices between appealing to white working class voters or minority voters, or between energizing the party’s base or reaching out to independents and Republicans.

I remember in history class, must have been a junior, it was during the impeachment process of President Clinton or all the scandal, everything that was going on. And I remember the teacher was just kind of riffing on this, and he said, you know, would anybody here ever want to be president or want to run for office, seeing what a mess and what an ugly place Washington was? And I just — maybe involuntarily, my hand went up. And from then on, it became that the running joke of the class that I’d wind up running for president. And then by the time I got to college, they had this Institute of Politics at Harvard, and every day, there’d be a different speaker who would come through. And I remember when I was there as a freshman, people like Donna Brazile who had just come off managing the Gore campaign and Rick Davis, who had done the same thing for McCain. And the former president of Ecuador, he’d been deposed in a coup. You’d just kind of hang around and watch them and see what they were like. The biggest realization was that they’re just people. These people who were shaping the world, people I was seeing on TV were obviously very impressive people, but they were just people. I think it changed my awareness of the fact that, on some level, I could be part of that world, too. But in a very simple sense, especially coming from Indiana, it seemed that it was a choice. You could be in elected office, or you could be an out gay person, not both, at least not where I was from. From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

Pete Buttigieg. It’s Friday, November 22. So Jeremy Peters, you cover politics for The Times, and you’ve been closely tracking Mayor Buttigieg. And in order to better understand the Democratic field of presidential candidates, we’re trying to figure out the most revealing moments in their lives. So when it comes to Pete Buttigieg, what moment should we focus on?

jeremy peters

Well, Mayor Pete has always been a candidate for whom his story, his biography is very central to his appeal to voters, and he’s got a great story to tell. He’s been elected mayor of this medium-sized town in Indiana before turning 30. He has an Ivy League pedigree. He’s been a Rhodes Scholar. He’s worked at a prestigious consulting firm. He’s gone off to Afghanistan as part of the Navy Reserves. So he has all of these components that you kind of think if you’re a voter, wow, he really stands out. There’s something unique about this guy. But at the same time, for most of his adult life, he had this nagging secret, the secret that he couldn’t confront because he thought that it would mean the end to this political career that he had spent so much time perfecting, basically since he went away to college and decided, hey, you know, I can run for president. And he doesn’t see how it’s possible for the politician with the perfect background, the perfect resume to also be open about their sexuality, in his case. So how he reconciles this inner turmoil with his very public ambition I think is a defining moment in his life, if not the defining moment.

michael barbaro

All right. Welcome to the studio.

pete buttigieg

Thank you.

michael barbaro

You’re going to sit there.

pete buttigieg

All right.

jeremy peters

So that story begins in 1982 in South Bend, Indiana where Peter Buttigieg was born.

michael barbaro

Mayor, tell me about the kind of kid that you were, growing up in Indiana?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think I was, safe to say, a little on the nerdy side. I lived in a neighborhood kind of in the middle of South Bend, close to a park where you would have as much as possible what you’d call a prototypical Midwestern kid’s upbringing, you know, playing in the park with friends, a lot of time in the house. I was really interested in baseball cards, but I was more interested in categorizing them than I was in baseball, I think. I loved science and science fiction. I loved reading, plus I was an only child. So I think it’s safe to say I had a lot of interior life going on in a fairly quiet house where it was a dog and my parents, who were both academics, and me.

michael barbaro

What was your introduction to even the idea of politics?

pete buttigieg

Politics was always in the air in our house just because my parents were very politically passionate. They really cared about what was happening. I can remember the Democratic Convention. It must have been 1988.

archived recording NBC News continues its coverage of America’s convention.

pete buttigieg

I would’ve been six years old and my parents explaining what a convention was. I remember Jesse Jackson giving a speech.

archived recording (jesse jackson) When I look out at this convention, I see the face of America — red, yellow, brown, black, and white. We are all precious in God’s sight, the real rainbow coalition.

pete buttigieg

And I remember my parents thinking it was important to watch the Republican Convention, too. I mean, you would stop — even though I don’t it ever crossed their mind to ever vote for a Republican.

archived recording Now let’s go down to the podium. Here is George Herbert Walker Bush addressing his convention.

pete buttigieg

Everything in the house would kind of stop when it was time to watch what was playing out.

archived recording Thank you.

michael barbaro

At what moment in this early phase of your life did you go from just watching this and maybe finding it very fascinating to feeling really drawn to it?

pete buttigieg

Well, when I got to college, it felt like the Republicans and the Democrats, at the time, it’s crazy to think about now, polarized as we are. But what it felt like when I showed up as a freshman on campus was that the two parties were converging and not necessarily in a good place, that you had this kind of center-right and center-left, both of them very committed to growth in business, but it seemed not very committed at all to some of the questions of how we take care of vulnerable people around the country. And I think there’s a moment for any kind of well-spoken or intelligent young person watching the news when you see a senator or a candidate saying something or doing something and you think, well, that’s not right. I could do that. I could do it different. Now, you might be wrong. They might be way more sophisticated than you are, and you can’t see it. Or you might be right, and it might well be the case that what they’re saying is just not right. But I certainly had that feeling reinforced when I saw these figures come to campus, some of whom were extremely impressive, but none of whom seemed like they were on a different plane of existence. They were just people.

michael barbaro

So at this point, a year or two into Harvard, have you made up your mind that you were probably going to find a way to have a career in politics?

pete buttigieg

I knew I wanted a career that involved policy. I don’t think I’d figured out for sure that that meant running. Plus, you know, when I thought about it, even well before I was coming to terms with the fact that I was gay, I knew that I had no political connections at home. I had an unpronounceable name, and I was a Democrat who lived in Indiana. So it was not obvious that I could overcome some of the obstacles toward running. But I think it’s safe to say by the time I graduated, I had some sense that I could see myself doing it.

michael barbaro

Well, I want to talk to you about that realization of your sexuality in particular. Obviously, your candidacy is historic in a couple of different ways, and among those is the fact you’re the first major party presidential candidate who is openly gay. And so I want to ask you about that part of your identity. When did you sense that you were gay? When did that realization start to dawn on you?

pete buttigieg

I think it depends what you mean by realization, right? There are things you could point to going way back, certainly a fascination I had with a classmate when I was about 12 that, in hindsight, is very obviously a crush. But I was not willing to think of it that way, although some part of me must have — I mean, I wasn’t stupid either, right? So you have this kind of awareness that was definitely there by the time I was hitting middle school. But taking a word like gay and applying it to myself, I was still years away from being able to do that, even in my own mind.

michael barbaro

Well, what did you do with those feelings?

pete buttigieg

I guess I packed them up, yeah.

michael barbaro

Packed them up —

pete buttigieg

Not much would be the best answer.

michael barbaro

Pack them up and put them where?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I don’t know how these things work, even in your own mind. I just didn’t explore them. That’s for sure. First of all, there were not a lot of out gay people that I knew as such growing up. I mean, in high school, it was exactly zero. There was just no sense of gay life or a gay community. And when I got to college, that’s when the kind of internal battle was starting to heat up.

michael barbaro

Why?

pete buttigieg

I think because you just can’t escape it. I mean, my god, you’re in college, right? I mean, any feelings you have, especially in the romantic department, are going to start asserting themselves even more fiercely than they have when you get to college. For a lot of people, it’s a big part of what you spend college on.

michael barbaro

Right. So how did you deal with it?

pete buttigieg

Same way I dealt with it up to then, just packed it away. Dated women, remarkable women. Because I enjoyed these relationships, I think I could defer facing the fact that that wasn’t the same as what it was to be in love with somebody.

michael barbaro

And your political ambition was already solid at that point?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I still didn’t know exactly where it would take me or what it would mean, but I think by then, I knew that there was a good chance I was going to be running for office in my adult life. But at that point, I’m still clinging to some kind of hope, however vanishing, that maybe I’m straight or I’m bisexual and I can just not worry about the gay part. I think when I thought about my career, certainly when I talked about my future and how I was going to be involved, I wasn’t even thinking about the possibility that that would come into contact with this developing side of me. But I’m sure to the extent that I thought what it would mean to come to terms with the fact that I was at very least different and, as became increasingly clear, gay, that one of the things that would have kept that in its corner was the simple fact that that didn’t fit with any of the other things I wanted to do in life, not just a career, but a family. I wanted to get married. I wanted to have kids. From my perspective, you could be married and have kids or you could be gay, not both.

michael barbaro

You graduated in 2004. That — correct me if I’m wrong. That’s the year when Massachusetts —

pete buttigieg

That’s right.

michael barbaro

— legalizes gay marriage.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

archived recording The court today, as you know, in a 4-3 advisory opinion to the Senate has a rule that in a November 18, 2003 decision, they meant marriage. They meant equality. They meant that the Commonwealth may no longer deny marriage rights to same-sex couples, including —

michael barbaro

So I say that only to try to understand, are you falling behind the culture, in a sense? Are you ignoring some of the signs that these things are changing?

archived recording Marriage and only marriage will be enough to satisfy the requirements of the Massachusetts Constitution.

pete buttigieg

Well, the thing is I wasn’t from Massachusetts. I was in Massachusetts for a while, but I never felt like I was from there. And nothing against Massachusetts, but I realized pretty quick after turning up at Harvard that I didn’t belong there either.

michael barbaro

Why not?

pete buttigieg

It was just — it was just a different culture. I didn’t realize that. I didn’t realize that I was Midwestern until I left the Midwest. And just little things, cultural things, the way — I don’t know, the way people interact, what’s expected of you. Once I got there, I realized that socially, I was way more Midwestern than I thought.

michael barbaro

So take me from graduating from Harvard to your decision to join the Navy Reserves.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so it starts with 9/11. Actually, it starts before 9/11. There’s this family tradition of serving in the military. There’s a painting hanging on the wall of my parents’ house of a relative, a great uncle who I kind of idolized in theory. He was an Army Air Corps pilot. And so I had this idea, this maybe romantic idea, of being in the military, and then it never really became real. But I remember on 9/11 thinking, oh, well, war isn’t just a thing that happens in other places or in other periods of history. Like, war has come to my generation, and thinking, at least in the back of my head, that that might mean I would be involved, but not taking any steps to do that. But that turned into more and more of a nagging feeling when some friends of mine started to serve. A friend of mine from college shared with me just before we graduated that he had decided to join the Navy Reserve. I was fascinated. And then when I was talking to someone about applying for the Rhodes Scholarship and how I wanted to talk about my interest in public service and to the faculty member who was giving advice to students, and just said, pointedly, like, you might want to really think about how you’re going to say that, knowing that you’re going to be competing against people from the military academies. Oh yeah, that’s true. Like, my chest thumping about caring about public service feels a lot smaller held up against what others are doing.

michael barbaro

Do you think that was one of the things that might have drawn you to military service, knowing that to get a Rhodes, to be in that world, in that league, you know, it might be a good thing?

pete buttigieg

I think definitely that it was part of how you’re true to a culture of service. And also the Kennedy presidency kind of hangs over certainly the Kennedy School, as you might imagine. And that can’t be separated from his military career.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

I mean, really, it was almost an expectation that you would’ve served, up until roughly the time when I came of age when everything shifted.

michael barbaro

An expectation that you would serve —

pete buttigieg

Well, when you’re looking at the history of the people we were studying —

michael barbaro

Of presidents.

pete buttigieg

— who have made history. Yep, as presidents. And then the thing that put me over the top was this experience knocking on doors in Iowa with a couple of buddies from college who went out. We took a week off and rented a car, and it was the last few days before the Iowa caucuses, and we were volunteers for Obama. They sent us to this very rural area, some of the lowest income counties in Iowa. And it felt like any time I met a young — especially young man — it was somebody who was serving or was about to serve. And I started to realize, we had service that used to be something that bridged people together. Now it’s completely different, that if you were rural or low-income, you were highly likely to serve. If you were from a background like mine, which was middle class economically, but I’d had the chance to go to an institution like Harvard, almost nobody with that background was serving. And I began to feel like it wasn’t just this kind of thing I thought about that I hadn’t gotten around to. It was that I was part of the problem. I was part of the divide. That was the thing that kind of propelled me that last few inches toward being ready to yank open the door of the recruiting office in Indiana and say, hey, how do I sign up?

michael barbaro

I wondered, do you think you joined the military in part because you knew what it would mean for a political career?

pete buttigieg

You know, I wrestled with that because as soon as I get that question, there’s a part of me that thinks, if the answer is yes, does that mean the service wasn’t pure in some way? And I remember at the time asking myself if being in the military was as unpopular as it is today popular, would I still do it? And I want to believe the answer is yes, but there’s no way to go back and prove it. I’m not somebody who thinks that it’s, like, a prerequisite that if you want to run for office you need to have served. But I do think if you have a heart for elected office, one way to put your money where your mouth is to have been in that kind of service, too.

michael barbaro

That strikes me as a very candid answer because of course, you could just say, well, of course I would have done it, even if there was no possible —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

— political benefit.

pete buttigieg

And I want to say that. I just can’t prove it.

michael barbaro

So I want to talk about this run for mayor for just a little bit. Whenever you run for office, your character is on display. And at this point, you are keeping something quite elemental about yourself secret. Did it feel like you were hiding something?

pete buttigieg

Not really. The only time it felt that way was when there was small talk about whether I was dating, and I would crack a joke or something. We’d be sitting in a studio like this one and a radio host would ask a question. And I’d say, well, if anybody listening is into economic policy and long walks on the beach, go ahead and reach out and just kind of play the busy single person, which is what I was, except for the fact that I wasn’t actively looking for love. I was going out of my way to avoid it. But if somebody who is straight up asked me on the record, to this day, I’m not sure what I would have done.

michael barbaro

Do you think that that would have potentially cost you the mayoralty, might have kept you from being mayor or staying mayor?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I think there’s a good chance of it. There’s a reason why no — as far as I know, no out gay person had ever run for mayor of any place in Indiana.

michael barbaro

This is a state with strong Christian values, and —

pete buttigieg

— not known for progressive social outlooks on politics. And here I am, rocking up, 29 years old saying, trust me, support me. Never mind this state legislator who has earned tons of credibility in this community. Never mind this county councilman who’s the party favorite. Go with me instead. If there had been anything that looked like a skeleton or a vulnerability, I think it probably would have sunk me before I got anywhere at all.

michael barbaro

So I want to now move into this notion of you reconciling these things.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so when I first joined the Reserve, the message was kind of you’re pretty much going to go to one of these wars, and we’ll let you know which one. And so I knew that, at a certain point, it was coming. And of course, I didn’t want to take office in South Bend without a plan for this. So we had gamed it out with my team, if I get orders, here’s what you do. And when I received my orders and knew I was going for sure, I don’t think even then it occurred to me that it would have much to do with my sexuality. If anything, I was thankful that I was single, right? The hardest thing for people to deploy is the fact that you’re leaving behind somebody you love, in addition to all the professional complications. But then, the more I started getting mentally ready for going over and really thinking about what it meant, the more it started weighing on me that I didn’t have a — wasn’t coming back to a family, my parents, of course, but I wasn’t coming back to a household. And more than that, I had no idea what it was like to be in love. And the idea that I’m — here I am. I’m a grown-ass man. I own a home. I’m the mayor of my city. I’m a military officer. And if I get killed over there, I will go to my grave not knowing what it’s like to be in love. And that just made me realize how untenable the situation I was in really was. And up until then, it didn’t seem untenable, I guess because I was so busy, and I might have deferred coming out and having a dating life forever, if not for this moment where I’m thinking, shit, I could die.

michael barbaro

You wrote a letter I want to ask you about.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, you know, it’s a thing you do. I assume everybody does it. I don’t know. But it’s the thing you do when you go to war, right? You want to make sure that you have the last word on your life and leave a few instructions. So I wrote up a letter, put an envelope, put just in case on the outside. Put it in the desk drawer, would’ve been pretty easy to find if worse comes to worst. And that’s a real moment, too, because you’re sitting there staring at the screen trying to figure out how to give a short accounting of your life.

michael barbaro

And what did you say?

pete buttigieg

Well, what I said was that I wouldn’t want people to think that I’d been cheated, that obviously it’d be terrible if I didn’t come back, but I also had this amazing life where I have wonderful friendships, and I got to serve my community in a way that very few people get to do, let alone at my age, and that I’d had this very fulfilling life. And of course, it’d be too bad if something happened to me, but to keep that in perspective. But if you’re asking if there was, like, P.S. I’m gay, no.

michael barbaro

That’s kind of what I was asking. So you are deployed.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

You do not die.

pete buttigieg

Right.

michael barbaro

You come back, and you’re mayor.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

And how do you decide that it’s time to come out?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think by the time I hit the ground and I was back, I knew that I was going to come out and then it’s just — it was more how and when. I remember resenting the idea that you’re supposed to have to come out, right? Straight people don’t have to come out. Why do I? And then, while I’m in the process of figuring this out —

archived recording Thank you all for coming. It’s been a tough week here in the Hoosier state, but we’re going to move forward.

pete buttigieg

We have this explosive controversy over Mike Pence, the Governor Mike Pence and his so-called Religious Freedom bill.

archived recording The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was about religious liberty, not about discrimination.

pete buttigieg

So suddenly, we’re on national television, my state, as the most officially anti-gay state in the country. I’m fighting him on it, of course, because it’s a terrible policy. But now, I’m fighting this terrible, anti-gay policy putatively from the perspective of a straight ally, wondering whether I’m more effective because people don’t know that I’m gay. And at the same time, knowing that this just kind of speeds things up even more that, like, it’s just a really weird position to be in, to be having all these hypothetical arguments about discrimination against gay people, when it really means me. Meanwhile, this is also the period when we realize that soon the Supreme Court is going to weigh in on marriage. I mean, all of this was happening in that early part of 2015 while I’m wrestling with how to do this. And so oddly enough, it was — — as busy as I was as mayor. Military duty actually felt like, kind of almost like a break because it was eight hour days, 40 hour week. I wasn’t used to having that much time, and so is a lot of time to sit and write and think and call friends and get advice.

michael barbaro

So you produce a plan.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, well I produced a letter, an op-ed I guess.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. What was the essential line that I’m sure you remember that you wrote?

pete buttigieg

I remember saying that it’s just part of who I am and that it has no bearing on how I do my job, that the way I do my — did my job either as an officer or as a mayor or in business had nothing to do with the fact that I was gay and that —

michael barbaro

It still sounds a little defensive.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Or maybe a little scared.

pete buttigieg

Probably. Yeah, I mean, you know, I didn’t feel like I was coming out guns blazing. I felt like I — again, part of me was bothered that I had to share this at all. Then part of me knew that it would do some good if I did, I mean, not just in my own life. That I — my main agenda was, personally, I wanted to get out there and start dating. But also that it would mean something, might mean all kinds of things to a whole bunch of different people when I came out and said this.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording A very personal announcement coming from South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg today. In an essay published in today’s South Bend Tribune, the mayor announced he is gay. Currently in the midst of running for a second term, Pete Buttigieg penned an essay in Tuesday’s South Bend Tribune revealing he was gay. A lot of people wondering why he chose to make this announcement now. It comes just months after the state’s religious freedom law thrust the state into the national debate on gay rights. As for the mayor himself, he says nothing is different, nothing has changed, and his focus is on South Bend.

michael barbaro

I want to talk about the timing, the exact moment of the op-ed because my sense is that at this phase of your career, you’re up for re-election, right? You’ve won the primary. And winning the primary, in a sense, means you’re standing a very good shot of winning.

pete buttigieg

Depending on the year, but yeah, in South Bend, it should be.

michael barbaro

So does that mean you deliberately chose a — like, a safe, low-risk time to do this?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I would think that going into a Democratic primary would be a safer time than going into a general election. And I think also the decision to do this came by way of realizing that there is no such thing as a safe time. I was just done with not having the kind of personal life that I wanted to have.

michael barbaro

So once you come out, how does your personal life change?

pete buttigieg

Well, I started dating, and that kind of changes everything. I mean, I still had this very demanding job. You’re the mayor, and so anybody in town that you ask to have a cup of coffee is —

michael barbaro

It’s a thing.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, it’s a thing. It might be misinterpreted. You could cross some line without meaning to. I mean, most of the people I interacted with were either people who needed something from me, people I needed something from or people who worked for me. So it’s not, like, a very healthy pool for dating is what I’m saying. And I remember thinking there were all these kind of city fathers who, early on in my time as mayor, seemed determined to fix me up with their daughters. And I remember just thinking, like, where are you now? Did none of you have, like, a son or a nephew or something? So I did what millennials do. I went online. Turns out there’s apps for all of this. There was O.K. Cupid, Tinder. The one that actually came through for me was called Hinge. And it’s supposed to serve up people that — I don’t know how the algorithm works. But I find this guy, this cute guy with a big smile, and I’m like, I want to know this guy. So we start chatting. Well, I was chatting with a lot of people, but obviously, he’s the one I remember because that was Chasten.

michael barbaro

Your future husband.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

michael barbaro

So your story, to many people, is particularly compelling one, everything we just discussed. You are a Harvard graduate, a Rhodes Scholar, you’re a veteran. You’re gay. You’re religious. And from your own description of yourself, it feels like you have been thinking about politics and preparing, to some degree, to run for president for a very long time, even though you’re quite young. And I’m sure you understand this and have heard this. That has led to this perception of a person kind of, perhaps, orchestrating a political biography. Do you ever question whether that, no matter what your intention, is — could possibly undermine the power of the story itself, however genuine?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I mean, I think we’re conditioned to not like the idea of somebody who sat around thinking all their lives about how to become president. And I don’t view myself that way, although I get that that story has been written around me. Although, I also don’t know what it is we expect, that somebody kind of gets struck by lightning and then they turn into somebody who might become president. We all have these paths, right, that bring us to where we are. And I think anybody in professional life or even social life thinks about the story that you tell about yourself. At the end of the day, I’m not doing this because I have this personal need to be in elected office or to be the president. I’m not coming at the presidency as a thing that I’d like to occupy. I’m coming at it as this way to do something that I think I’m able to do. And I think it’s helpful in the sense that I could also have a very happy life doing something else. And oddly, I think that — that helps prepare me to do what’s required to do this. And this is advice I give talking to students, too. Imagine somebody is being sworn in, an ambitious, talented person kind of in the middle of their career is being sworn in as an assistant secretary in the State Department for the Middle East. And then imagine if that person has got there one of two ways. In kind of universe A, it’s a person who woke up one day in high school and said, I want to be the assistant secretary for the Middle East, and took the right courses and got the right jobs and had the right fellowships and wrote the right papers and did everything in order to occupy that title. And the other person is somebody who said, I — woke up in high school and said, I want to be the person who makes the United States a force toward peace in the Middle East. And they don’t know what that’s going to mean, and maybe it means they start out becoming an activist or maybe they’re an academic or maybe they’re a civil servant or whatever. But by whatever winding path, they wind up in this job, right? Which of those two scenarios is going to lead to somebody who’s better equipped to take that job they’ve been handed? I’ve got to think it’s the latter. And so what I’ve tried to do in my life is to prepare myself to be useful to others. And yes, I think that, in all likelihood, means in a form that involves holding office or seeking office or at least public life where I speak to lots of people, sometimes millions at the same time. But it’s not about, necessarily, having one title or another. And so I think if you overthink it, that’s where you start to lose the fidelity to what it is that would guide you when you actually get what you’ve been chasing for a long time. Jeremy, what do we learn from Mayor Pete Buttigieg about the way he reconciled his political ambition with this essential fact about himself that he feared would endanger that ambition?

jeremy peters

I think we learn a lot about his decision-making process, not just how he internalizes decisions personally, but how he thinks about them in the longer arc of a political career. And he’s been very intentional all along the way about choosing certain endeavors that he thinks would benefit a long-term political career. Now some people would think, on the one hand, that’s too calculating. I don’t want somebody who’s thought about being president since he was a teenager. And, you know, in the era when voters seemed to prize authenticity in their political figures, they could see that as inauthentic. On the other hand, the decision that he made to wait seems to have borne out to his benefit. I mean, here he is, the first openly gay candidate for president of the United States who has a legitimate shot at being his party’s nominee. Look at where he is in the Democratic primary right now. He’s rocketed to the top of the polls. He’s brought in all this money in large part because he’s gay, and that opened a lot of doors with Democratic donors. He’s heading into the Iowa caucuses in the lead by some measures. But we won’t know if his decision to wait actually was the right one until people start voting. So it seems to have worked out well for him right now, but no one’s cast a single vote. And we don’t know how voters in the Democratic primary are going to react. We certainly don’t know how voters in a general election are going to react. So we’re just not going to know until Democratic voters have their say.

michael barbaro

Mayor, when you think back to your younger self —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Not just your teenage self, but even your college self and your post-collegiate self who was so fearful about telling the world that you were gay, what do you kind of wish you could tell that person, that version of Mayor Buttigieg?

pete buttigieg

Well, back then, I would have thought this other fact, if I dared to unpack it, this fact about my life, this way in which I was different, was the thing that could multiply all the other stuff by zero, in terms of the impact I was going to have in the world, that I might very well choose that path, but that the price would be that I wouldn’t get to make a difference in public life. And if you want proof of God having a sense of humor, one of the things I’m seeing now, especially in the interactions I have on the campaign trail and the fact that this campaign is historic in a lot of ways, is that that same fact that I thought would mean never getting to this point might actually be one of the things that makes it matter the most.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

It’s a strange thing to think about that the one thing that I couldn’t control, the one thing that might have meant that it would be better not to have any aspirations related to politics at all could be the very thing that anchors the moral and emotional purpose of this entire campaign.

michael barbaro

Thank you very much.

pete buttigieg

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

michael barbaro

In the latest public testimony before impeachment investigators, Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert on the National Security Council, recalled her growing frustration with Ambassador Gordon Sondland, as she realized he was pursuing a political agenda in Ukraine on behalf of President Trump.

archived recording (fiona hill) He was being involved in a domestic, political errand, and we were being involved in national security foreign policy and those two things have just diverged.

michael barbaro

Hill testified that when Trump and Sondland pressed Ukraine to investigate the discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, they were playing directly into Russia’s hands, since Russia wants to deflect attention away from its interference.

archived recording (fiona hill) This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves. These fictions are harmful, even if they’re deployed for purely domestic, political purposes.

But No One Was Attacked Like Warren.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/opinion/democratic-debate-warren.html,"That criticism, both technical and philosophical, continued in an inevitable segment about Medicare for All with Ms. Warren facing criticism from both her left and right flanks. In previous debates, Ms. Warren avoided saying exactly how she would pay for the tens of trillions in new government spending the health care system she favors would entail. But she recently released both a financing plan and an implementation timeline in which she proposed putting off the push for a full-fledged single-payer system.

That segment opened with Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., touting his own plan, which he calls Medicare for All Who Want It, as a way to avoid the “divisive” step of eliminating most private insurance and forcing most Americans onto a government health care plan. Mr. Biden, similarly, framed his opposition to Ms. Warren’s proposal by saying, “I trust the American people.” Once again, it was an attack not only on Ms. Warren’s plan, but on the political philosophy it represents.

From the other side of the debate, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose Medicare for All bill Ms. Warren backs, implied that he didn’t trust Ms. Warren’s plan to hold off on Medicare for All until late in her first term. Now is the time, he said, practically pounding the podium. “In the first week of my administration, we will introduce Medicare for All.” The message was clear: Warrenism, which would wait until year three to fight for single-payer, was insufficiently devoted to the revolutionary cause.

These exchanges illustrate the Democratic Party’s growing uneasiness with Ms. Warren and her brand of fussy technocratic populism, which can come across as both too radical and too timidly wonky at the same time.

Throughout her campaign, Ms. Warren has attempted to occupy a middle ground between the party’s moderate wing and its progressive base. But her have-it-both-ways strategy may well have backfired. Despite Ms. Warren’s ascension to the primary’s top tier, the steadiness of Mr. Biden’s polling and the recent rise of Mr. Buttigieg in Iowa and New Hampshire — along with the dips in Ms. Warren’s own polling — suggest not only the limits of her strategy but the limitations of the underlying worldview itself."

Digs at President Trump

“With all due deference to the fact that this is a presidential debate, Donald Trump got punked.”

Senator Kamala Harris of California said President Trump had compromised the checks and balances on North Korea’s nuclear capabilities with his unilateral dealings with the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un.

MODERATOR: Many states, including right here where we are tonight in Georgia, have passed laws that severely limit or outright ban abortion. Right now, Roe v. Wade protects a woman’s right to abortion nationwide. But if Roe gets overturned and abortion access disappears in some states, would you intervene as president to try to bring that access back, Senator Klobuchar?

AMY KLOBUCHAR: Of course. We should codify Roe v. Wade into law. That’s what we should do. And this president indicated early on what he was going to do, and he’s done it. When he was running for office, he literally said women should go to jail, and then he dialed it back and said doctors should go to jail. So no surprise we’re seeing these kinds of laws in Georgia, in Alabama, where his allies are passing these bills. And what we have to remember is that the people are with us. And I predict this will be a big issue in the general election. And I just can’t wait to stand across from Donald Trump and say this to him: “You know what? The people are with us.” Over 70 percent of the people support Roe v. Wade. Over 90 percent of the people support funding for Planned Parenthood and making sure that women can get the health care they need. He is off the track on this, and he will hear from the women of America, and this is how we’re going to win this election.

MODERATOR: Just this weekend, Louisiana re-elected a Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards. He has signed one of the country’s toughest laws restricting abortion. Is there room in the Democratic Party for someone like him? Someone who can win in a deep red state but who does not support abortion rights? Senator Warren.

ELIZABETH WARREN: I believe that abortion rights are human rights. I believe that they are also economic rights. And protecting the right of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body is fundamentally what we do and what we stand for as a Democratic Party. Understand this: When someone makes abortion illegal in America, rich women will still get abortions. It’s just going to fall hard on poor women. It’s going to fall hard on girls, women who don’t even know that they’re pregnant, because they have been molested by an uncle. I want to be an America where everybody has a chance. And I know it can be a hard decision for people. But here’s the thing. When it comes down to that decision, a woman should be able to call on her mother. She should be able to call on her partner. She should be able to call on her priest or her rabbi. But the one entity that should not be in the middle of that decision is the government.

MODERATOR: Senator Warren, I’m going to push you on this a little bit for a specific answer to the question. Gov. John Bel Edwards in Louisiana is an anti-abortion governor who has signed abortion restrictions in Louisiana. Is there room for him in the Democratic Party with these politics?"

I remember in history class, must have been a junior, it was during the impeachment process of President Clinton or all the scandal, everything that was going on. And I remember the teacher was just kind of riffing on this, and he said, you know, would anybody here ever want to be president or want to run for office, seeing what a mess and what an ugly place Washington was? And I just — maybe involuntarily, my hand went up. And from then on, it became that the running joke of the class that I’d wind up running for president. And then by the time I got to college, they had this Institute of Politics at Harvard, and every day, there’d be a different speaker who would come through. And I remember when I was there as a freshman, people like Donna Brazile who had just come off managing the Gore campaign and Rick Davis, who had done the same thing for McCain. And the former president of Ecuador, he’d been deposed in a coup. You’d just kind of hang around and watch them and see what they were like. The biggest realization was that they’re just people. These people who were shaping the world, people I was seeing on TV were obviously very impressive people, but they were just people. I think it changed my awareness of the fact that, on some level, I could be part of that world, too. But in a very simple sense, especially coming from Indiana, it seemed that it was a choice. You could be in elected office, or you could be an out gay person, not both, at least not where I was from. From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

Pete Buttigieg. It’s Friday, November 22. So Jeremy Peters, you cover politics for The Times, and you’ve been closely tracking Mayor Buttigieg. And in order to better understand the Democratic field of presidential candidates, we’re trying to figure out the most revealing moments in their lives. So when it comes to Pete Buttigieg, what moment should we focus on?

jeremy peters

Well, Mayor Pete has always been a candidate for whom his story, his biography is very central to his appeal to voters, and he’s got a great story to tell. He’s been elected mayor of this medium-sized town in Indiana before turning 30. He has an Ivy League pedigree. He’s been a Rhodes Scholar. He’s worked at a prestigious consulting firm. He’s gone off to Afghanistan as part of the Navy Reserves. So he has all of these components that you kind of think if you’re a voter, wow, he really stands out. There’s something unique about this guy. But at the same time, for most of his adult life, he had this nagging secret, the secret that he couldn’t confront because he thought that it would mean the end to this political career that he had spent so much time perfecting, basically since he went away to college and decided, hey, you know, I can run for president. And he doesn’t see how it’s possible for the politician with the perfect background, the perfect resume to also be open about their sexuality, in his case. So how he reconciles this inner turmoil with his very public ambition I think is a defining moment in his life, if not the defining moment.

michael barbaro

All right. Welcome to the studio.

pete buttigieg

Thank you.

michael barbaro

You’re going to sit there.

pete buttigieg

All right.

jeremy peters

So that story begins in 1982 in South Bend, Indiana where Peter Buttigieg was born.

michael barbaro

Mayor, tell me about the kind of kid that you were, growing up in Indiana?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think I was, safe to say, a little on the nerdy side. I lived in a neighborhood kind of in the middle of South Bend, close to a park where you would have as much as possible what you’d call a prototypical Midwestern kid’s upbringing, you know, playing in the park with friends, a lot of time in the house. I was really interested in baseball cards, but I was more interested in categorizing them than I was in baseball, I think. I loved science and science fiction. I loved reading, plus I was an only child. So I think it’s safe to say I had a lot of interior life going on in a fairly quiet house where it was a dog and my parents, who were both academics, and me.

michael barbaro

What was your introduction to even the idea of politics?

pete buttigieg

Politics was always in the air in our house just because my parents were very politically passionate. They really cared about what was happening. I can remember the Democratic Convention. It must have been 1988.

archived recording NBC News continues its coverage of America’s convention.

pete buttigieg

I would’ve been six years old and my parents explaining what a convention was. I remember Jesse Jackson giving a speech.

archived recording (jesse jackson) When I look out at this convention, I see the face of America — red, yellow, brown, black, and white. We are all precious in God’s sight, the real rainbow coalition.

pete buttigieg

And I remember my parents thinking it was important to watch the Republican Convention, too. I mean, you would stop — even though I don’t it ever crossed their mind to ever vote for a Republican.

archived recording Now let’s go down to the podium. Here is George Herbert Walker Bush addressing his convention.

pete buttigieg

Everything in the house would kind of stop when it was time to watch what was playing out.

archived recording Thank you.

michael barbaro

At what moment in this early phase of your life did you go from just watching this and maybe finding it very fascinating to feeling really drawn to it?

pete buttigieg

Well, when I got to college, it felt like the Republicans and the Democrats, at the time, it’s crazy to think about now, polarized as we are. But what it felt like when I showed up as a freshman on campus was that the two parties were converging and not necessarily in a good place, that you had this kind of center-right and center-left, both of them very committed to growth in business, but it seemed not very committed at all to some of the questions of how we take care of vulnerable people around the country. And I think there’s a moment for any kind of well-spoken or intelligent young person watching the news when you see a senator or a candidate saying something or doing something and you think, well, that’s not right. I could do that. I could do it different. Now, you might be wrong. They might be way more sophisticated than you are, and you can’t see it. Or you might be right, and it might well be the case that what they’re saying is just not right. But I certainly had that feeling reinforced when I saw these figures come to campus, some of whom were extremely impressive, but none of whom seemed like they were on a different plane of existence. They were just people.

michael barbaro

So at this point, a year or two into Harvard, have you made up your mind that you were probably going to find a way to have a career in politics?

pete buttigieg

I knew I wanted a career that involved policy. I don’t think I’d figured out for sure that that meant running. Plus, you know, when I thought about it, even well before I was coming to terms with the fact that I was gay, I knew that I had no political connections at home. I had an unpronounceable name, and I was a Democrat who lived in Indiana. So it was not obvious that I could overcome some of the obstacles toward running. But I think it’s safe to say by the time I graduated, I had some sense that I could see myself doing it.

michael barbaro

Well, I want to talk to you about that realization of your sexuality in particular. Obviously, your candidacy is historic in a couple of different ways, and among those is the fact you’re the first major party presidential candidate who is openly gay. And so I want to ask you about that part of your identity. When did you sense that you were gay? When did that realization start to dawn on you?

pete buttigieg

I think it depends what you mean by realization, right? There are things you could point to going way back, certainly a fascination I had with a classmate when I was about 12 that, in hindsight, is very obviously a crush. But I was not willing to think of it that way, although some part of me must have — I mean, I wasn’t stupid either, right? So you have this kind of awareness that was definitely there by the time I was hitting middle school. But taking a word like gay and applying it to myself, I was still years away from being able to do that, even in my own mind.

michael barbaro

Well, what did you do with those feelings?

pete buttigieg

I guess I packed them up, yeah.

michael barbaro

Packed them up —

pete buttigieg

Not much would be the best answer.

michael barbaro

Pack them up and put them where?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I don’t know how these things work, even in your own mind. I just didn’t explore them. That’s for sure. First of all, there were not a lot of out gay people that I knew as such growing up. I mean, in high school, it was exactly zero. There was just no sense of gay life or a gay community. And when I got to college, that’s when the kind of internal battle was starting to heat up.

michael barbaro

Why?

pete buttigieg

I think because you just can’t escape it. I mean, my god, you’re in college, right? I mean, any feelings you have, especially in the romantic department, are going to start asserting themselves even more fiercely than they have when you get to college. For a lot of people, it’s a big part of what you spend college on.

michael barbaro

Right. So how did you deal with it?

pete buttigieg

Same way I dealt with it up to then, just packed it away. Dated women, remarkable women. Because I enjoyed these relationships, I think I could defer facing the fact that that wasn’t the same as what it was to be in love with somebody.

michael barbaro

And your political ambition was already solid at that point?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I still didn’t know exactly where it would take me or what it would mean, but I think by then, I knew that there was a good chance I was going to be running for office in my adult life. But at that point, I’m still clinging to some kind of hope, however vanishing, that maybe I’m straight or I’m bisexual and I can just not worry about the gay part. I think when I thought about my career, certainly when I talked about my future and how I was going to be involved, I wasn’t even thinking about the possibility that that would come into contact with this developing side of me. But I’m sure to the extent that I thought what it would mean to come to terms with the fact that I was at very least different and, as became increasingly clear, gay, that one of the things that would have kept that in its corner was the simple fact that that didn’t fit with any of the other things I wanted to do in life, not just a career, but a family. I wanted to get married. I wanted to have kids. From my perspective, you could be married and have kids or you could be gay, not both.

michael barbaro

You graduated in 2004. That — correct me if I’m wrong. That’s the year when Massachusetts —

pete buttigieg

That’s right.

michael barbaro

— legalizes gay marriage.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

archived recording The court today, as you know, in a 4-3 advisory opinion to the Senate has a rule that in a November 18, 2003 decision, they meant marriage. They meant equality. They meant that the Commonwealth may no longer deny marriage rights to same-sex couples, including —

michael barbaro

So I say that only to try to understand, are you falling behind the culture, in a sense? Are you ignoring some of the signs that these things are changing?

archived recording Marriage and only marriage will be enough to satisfy the requirements of the Massachusetts Constitution.

pete buttigieg

Well, the thing is I wasn’t from Massachusetts. I was in Massachusetts for a while, but I never felt like I was from there. And nothing against Massachusetts, but I realized pretty quick after turning up at Harvard that I didn’t belong there either.

michael barbaro

Why not?

pete buttigieg

It was just — it was just a different culture. I didn’t realize that. I didn’t realize that I was Midwestern until I left the Midwest. And just little things, cultural things, the way — I don’t know, the way people interact, what’s expected of you. Once I got there, I realized that socially, I was way more Midwestern than I thought.

michael barbaro

So take me from graduating from Harvard to your decision to join the Navy Reserves.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so it starts with 9/11. Actually, it starts before 9/11. There’s this family tradition of serving in the military. There’s a painting hanging on the wall of my parents’ house of a relative, a great uncle who I kind of idolized in theory. He was an Army Air Corps pilot. And so I had this idea, this maybe romantic idea, of being in the military, and then it never really became real. But I remember on 9/11 thinking, oh, well, war isn’t just a thing that happens in other places or in other periods of history. Like, war has come to my generation, and thinking, at least in the back of my head, that that might mean I would be involved, but not taking any steps to do that. But that turned into more and more of a nagging feeling when some friends of mine started to serve. A friend of mine from college shared with me just before we graduated that he had decided to join the Navy Reserve. I was fascinated. And then when I was talking to someone about applying for the Rhodes Scholarship and how I wanted to talk about my interest in public service and to the faculty member who was giving advice to students, and just said, pointedly, like, you might want to really think about how you’re going to say that, knowing that you’re going to be competing against people from the military academies. Oh yeah, that’s true. Like, my chest thumping about caring about public service feels a lot smaller held up against what others are doing.

Do you think that was one of the things that might have drawn you to military service, knowing that to get a Rhodes, to be in that world, in that league, you know, it might be a good thing?

pete buttigieg

I think definitely that it was part of how you’re true to a culture of service. And also the Kennedy presidency kind of hangs over certainly the Kennedy School, as you might imagine. And that can’t be separated from his military career.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

I mean, really, it was almost an expectation that you would’ve served, up until roughly the time when I came of age when everything shifted.

michael barbaro

An expectation that you would serve —

pete buttigieg

Well, when you’re looking at the history of the people we were studying —

michael barbaro

Of presidents.

pete buttigieg

— who have made history. Yep, as presidents. And then the thing that put me over the top was this experience knocking on doors in Iowa with a couple of buddies from college who went out. We took a week off and rented a car, and it was the last few days before the Iowa caucuses, and we were volunteers for Obama. They sent us to this very rural area, some of the lowest income counties in Iowa. And it felt like any time I met a young — especially young man — it was somebody who was serving or was about to serve. And I started to realize, we had service that used to be something that bridged people together. Now it’s completely different, that if you were rural or low-income, you were highly likely to serve. If you were from a background like mine, which was middle class economically, but I’d had the chance to go to an institution like Harvard, almost nobody with that background was serving. And I began to feel like it wasn’t just this kind of thing I thought about that I hadn’t gotten around to. It was that I was part of the problem. I was part of the divide. That was the thing that kind of propelled me that last few inches toward being ready to yank open the door of the recruiting office in Indiana and say, hey, how do I sign up?

michael barbaro

I wondered, do you think you joined the military in part because you knew what it would mean for a political career?

pete buttigieg

You know, I wrestled with that because as soon as I get that question, there’s a part of me that thinks, if the answer is yes, does that mean the service wasn’t pure in some way? And I remember at the time asking myself if being in the military was as unpopular as it is today popular, would I still do it? And I want to believe the answer is yes, but there’s no way to go back and prove it. I’m not somebody who thinks that it’s, like, a prerequisite that if you want to run for office you need to have served. But I do think if you have a heart for elected office, one way to put your money where your mouth is to have been in that kind of service, too.

michael barbaro

That strikes me as a very candid answer because of course, you could just say, well, of course I would have done it, even if there was no possible —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

— political benefit.

pete buttigieg

And I want to say that. I just can’t prove it.

michael barbaro

So I want to talk about this run for mayor for just a little bit. Whenever you run for office, your character is on display. And at this point, you are keeping something quite elemental about yourself secret. Did it feel like you were hiding something?

pete buttigieg

Not really. The only time it felt that way was when there was small talk about whether I was dating, and I would crack a joke or something. We’d be sitting in a studio like this one and a radio host would ask a question. And I’d say, well, if anybody listening is into economic policy and long walks on the beach, go ahead and reach out and just kind of play the busy single person, which is what I was, except for the fact that I wasn’t actively looking for love. I was going out of my way to avoid it. But if somebody who is straight up asked me on the record, to this day, I’m not sure what I would have done.

michael barbaro

Do you think that that would have potentially cost you the mayoralty, might have kept you from being mayor or staying mayor?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I think there’s a good chance of it. There’s a reason why no — as far as I know, no out gay person had ever run for mayor of any place in Indiana.

michael barbaro

This is a state with strong Christian values, and —

pete buttigieg

— not known for progressive social outlooks on politics. And here I am, rocking up, 29 years old saying, trust me, support me. Never mind this state legislator who has earned tons of credibility in this community. Never mind this county councilman who’s the party favorite. Go with me instead. If there had been anything that looked like a skeleton or a vulnerability, I think it probably would have sunk me before I got anywhere at all.

michael barbaro

So I want to now move into this notion of you reconciling these things.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so when I first joined the Reserve, the message was kind of you’re pretty much going to go to one of these wars, and we’ll let you know which one. And so I knew that, at a certain point, it was coming. And of course, I didn’t want to take office in South Bend without a plan for this. So we had gamed it out with my team, if I get orders, here’s what you do. And when I received my orders and knew I was going for sure, I don’t think even then it occurred to me that it would have much to do with my sexuality. If anything, I was thankful that I was single, right? The hardest thing for people to deploy is the fact that you’re leaving behind somebody you love, in addition to all the professional complications. But then, the more I started getting mentally ready for going over and really thinking about what it meant, the more it started weighing on me that I didn’t have a — wasn’t coming back to a family, my parents, of course, but I wasn’t coming back to a household. And more than that, I had no idea what it was like to be in love. And the idea that I’m — here I am. I’m a grown-ass man. I own a home. I’m the mayor of my city. I’m a military officer. And if I get killed over there, I will go to my grave not knowing what it’s like to be in love. And that just made me realize how untenable the situation I was in really was. And up until then, it didn’t seem untenable, I guess because I was so busy, and I might have deferred coming out and having a dating life forever, if not for this moment where I’m thinking, shit, I could die.

michael barbaro

You wrote a letter I want to ask you about.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, you know, it’s a thing you do. I assume everybody does it. I don’t know. But it’s the thing you do when you go to war, right? You want to make sure that you have the last word on your life and leave a few instructions. So I wrote up a letter, put an envelope, put just in case on the outside. Put it in the desk drawer, would’ve been pretty easy to find if worse comes to worst. And that’s a real moment, too, because you’re sitting there staring at the screen trying to figure out how to give a short accounting of your life.

michael barbaro

And what did you say?

pete buttigieg

Well, what I said was that I wouldn’t want people to think that I’d been cheated, that obviously it’d be terrible if I didn’t come back, but I also had this amazing life where I have wonderful friendships, and I got to serve my community in a way that very few people get to do, let alone at my age, and that I’d had this very fulfilling life. And of course, it’d be too bad if something happened to me, but to keep that in perspective. But if you’re asking if there was, like, P.S. I’m gay, no.

michael barbaro

That’s kind of what I was asking. So you are deployed.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

You do not die.

pete buttigieg

Right.

michael barbaro

You come back, and you’re mayor.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

And how do you decide that it’s time to come out?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think by the time I hit the ground and I was back, I knew that I was going to come out and then it’s just — it was more how and when. I remember resenting the idea that you’re supposed to have to come out, right? Straight people don’t have to come out. Why do I? And then, while I’m in the process of figuring this out —

archived recording Thank you all for coming. It’s been a tough week here in the Hoosier state, but we’re going to move forward.

pete buttigieg

We have this explosive controversy over Mike Pence, the Governor Mike Pence and his so-called Religious Freedom bill.

archived recording The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was about religious liberty, not about discrimination.

pete buttigieg

So suddenly, we’re on national television, my state, as the most officially anti-gay state in the country. I’m fighting him on it, of course, because it’s a terrible policy. But now, I’m fighting this terrible, anti-gay policy putatively from the perspective of a straight ally, wondering whether I’m more effective because people don’t know that I’m gay. And at the same time, knowing that this just kind of speeds things up even more that, like, it’s just a really weird position to be in, to be having all these hypothetical arguments about discrimination against gay people, when it really means me. Meanwhile, this is also the period when we realize that soon the Supreme Court is going to weigh in on marriage. I mean, all of this was happening in that early part of 2015 while I’m wrestling with how to do this. And so oddly enough, it was — — as busy as I was as mayor. Military duty actually felt like, kind of almost like a break because it was eight hour days, 40 hour week. I wasn’t used to having that much time, and so is a lot of time to sit and write and think and call friends and get advice.

michael barbaro

So you produce a plan.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, well I produced a letter, an op-ed I guess.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. What was the essential line that I’m sure you remember that you wrote?

pete buttigieg

I remember saying that it’s just part of who I am and that it has no bearing on how I do my job, that the way I do my — did my job either as an officer or as a mayor or in business had nothing to do with the fact that I was gay and that —

michael barbaro

It still sounds a little defensive.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Or maybe a little scared.

pete buttigieg

Probably. Yeah, I mean, you know, I didn’t feel like I was coming out guns blazing. I felt like I — again, part of me was bothered that I had to share this at all. Then part of me knew that it would do some good if I did, I mean, not just in my own life. That I — my main agenda was, personally, I wanted to get out there and start dating. But also that it would mean something, might mean all kinds of things to a whole bunch of different people when I came out and said this.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording A very personal announcement coming from South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg today. In an essay published in today’s South Bend Tribune, the mayor announced he is gay. Currently in the midst of running for a second term, Pete Buttigieg penned an essay in Tuesday’s South Bend Tribune revealing he was gay. A lot of people wondering why he chose to make this announcement now. It comes just months after the state’s religious freedom law thrust the state into the national debate on gay rights. As for the mayor himself, he says nothing is different, nothing has changed, and his focus is on South Bend.

michael barbaro

I want to talk about the timing, the exact moment of the op-ed because my sense is that at this phase of your career, you’re up for re-election, right? You’ve won the primary. And winning the primary, in a sense, means you’re standing a very good shot of winning.

pete buttigieg

Depending on the year, but yeah, in South Bend, it should be.

michael barbaro

So does that mean you deliberately chose a — like, a safe, low-risk time to do this?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I would think that going into a Democratic primary would be a safer time than going into a general election. And I think also the decision to do this came by way of realizing that there is no such thing as a safe time. I was just done with not having the kind of personal life that I wanted to have.

michael barbaro

So once you come out, how does your personal life change?

pete buttigieg

Well, I started dating, and that kind of changes everything. I mean, I still had this very demanding job. You’re the mayor, and so anybody in town that you ask to have a cup of coffee is —

michael barbaro

It’s a thing.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, it’s a thing. It might be misinterpreted. You could cross some line without meaning to. I mean, most of the people I interacted with were either people who needed something from me, people I needed something from or people who worked for me. So it’s not, like, a very healthy pool for dating is what I’m saying. And I remember thinking there were all these kind of city fathers who, early on in my time as mayor, seemed determined to fix me up with their daughters. And I remember just thinking, like, where are you now? Did none of you have, like, a son or a nephew or something? So I did what millennials do. I went online. Turns out there’s apps for all of this. There was O.K. Cupid, Tinder. The one that actually came through for me was called Hinge. And it’s supposed to serve up people that — I don’t know how the algorithm works. But I find this guy, this cute guy with a big smile, and I’m like, I want to know this guy. So we start chatting. Well, I was chatting with a lot of people, but obviously, he’s the one I remember because that was Chasten.

michael barbaro

Your future husband.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

michael barbaro

So your story, to many people, is particularly compelling one, everything we just discussed. You are a Harvard graduate, a Rhodes Scholar, you’re a veteran. You’re gay. You’re religious. And from your own description of yourself, it feels like you have been thinking about politics and preparing, to some degree, to run for president for a very long time, even though you’re quite young. And I’m sure you understand this and have heard this. That has led to this perception of a person kind of, perhaps, orchestrating a political biography. Do you ever question whether that, no matter what your intention, is — could possibly undermine the power of the story itself, however genuine?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I mean, I think we’re conditioned to not like the idea of somebody who sat around thinking all their lives about how to become president. And I don’t view myself that way, although I get that that story has been written around me. Although, I also don’t know what it is we expect, that somebody kind of gets struck by lightning and then they turn into somebody who might become president. We all have these paths, right, that bring us to where we are. And I think anybody in professional life or even social life thinks about the story that you tell about yourself. At the end of the day, I’m not doing this because I have this personal need to be in elected office or to be the president. I’m not coming at the presidency as a thing that I’d like to occupy. I’m coming at it as this way to do something that I think I’m able to do. And I think it’s helpful in the sense that I could also have a very happy life doing something else. And oddly, I think that — that helps prepare me to do what’s required to do this. And this is advice I give talking to students, too. Imagine somebody is being sworn in, an ambitious, talented person kind of in the middle of their career is being sworn in as an assistant secretary in the State Department for the Middle East. And then imagine if that person has got there one of two ways. In kind of universe A, it’s a person who woke up one day in high school and said, I want to be the assistant secretary for the Middle East, and took the right courses and got the right jobs and had the right fellowships and wrote the right papers and did everything in order to occupy that title. And the other person is somebody who said, I — woke up in high school and said, I want to be the person who makes the United States a force toward peace in the Middle East. And they don’t know what that’s going to mean, and maybe it means they start out becoming an activist or maybe they’re an academic or maybe they’re a civil servant or whatever. But by whatever winding path, they wind up in this job, right? Which of those two scenarios is going to lead to somebody who’s better equipped to take that job they’ve been handed? I’ve got to think it’s the latter. And so what I’ve tried to do in my life is to prepare myself to be useful to others. And yes, I think that, in all likelihood, means in a form that involves holding office or seeking office or at least public life where I speak to lots of people, sometimes millions at the same time. But it’s not about, necessarily, having one title or another. And so I think if you overthink it, that’s where you start to lose the fidelity to what it is that would guide you when you actually get what you’ve been chasing for a long time. Jeremy, what do we learn from Mayor Pete Buttigieg about the way he reconciled his political ambition with this essential fact about himself that he feared would endanger that ambition?

jeremy peters

I think we learn a lot about his decision-making process, not just how he internalizes decisions personally, but how he thinks about them in the longer arc of a political career. And he’s been very intentional all along the way about choosing certain endeavors that he thinks would benefit a long-term political career. Now some people would think, on the one hand, that’s too calculating. I don’t want somebody who’s thought about being president since he was a teenager. And, you know, in the era when voters seemed to prize authenticity in their political figures, they could see that as inauthentic. On the other hand, the decision that he made to wait seems to have borne out to his benefit. I mean, here he is, the first openly gay candidate for president of the United States who has a legitimate shot at being his party’s nominee. Look at where he is in the Democratic primary right now. He’s rocketed to the top of the polls. He’s brought in all this money in large part because he’s gay, and that opened a lot of doors with Democratic donors. He’s heading into the Iowa caucuses in the lead by some measures. But we won’t know if his decision to wait actually was the right one until people start voting. So it seems to have worked out well for him right now, but no one’s cast a single vote. And we don’t know how voters in the Democratic primary are going to react. We certainly don’t know how voters in a general election are going to react. So we’re just not going to know until Democratic voters have their say.

michael barbaro

Mayor, when you think back to your younger self —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Not just your teenage self, but even your college self and your post-collegiate self who was so fearful about telling the world that you were gay, what do you kind of wish you could tell that person, that version of Mayor Buttigieg?

pete buttigieg

Well, back then, I would have thought this other fact, if I dared to unpack it, this fact about my life, this way in which I was different, was the thing that could multiply all the other stuff by zero, in terms of the impact I was going to have in the world, that I might very well choose that path, but that the price would be that I wouldn’t get to make a difference in public life. And if you want proof of God having a sense of humor, one of the things I’m seeing now, especially in the interactions I have on the campaign trail and the fact that this campaign is historic in a lot of ways, is that that same fact that I thought would mean never getting to this point might actually be one of the things that makes it matter the most.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

It’s a strange thing to think about that the one thing that I couldn’t control, the one thing that might have meant that it would be better not to have any aspirations related to politics at all could be the very thing that anchors the moral and emotional purpose of this entire campaign.

michael barbaro

Thank you very much.

pete buttigieg

Thanks for having me.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (fiona hill) And I did say to him, Ambassador Sondland, Gordon, I think this is all going to blow up, and here we are.

michael barbaro

In the latest public testimony before impeachment investigators, Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert on the National Security Council, recalled her growing frustration with Ambassador Gordon Sondland, as she realized he was pursuing a political agenda in Ukraine on behalf of President Trump.

archived recording (fiona hill) He was being involved in a domestic, political errand, and we were being involved in national security foreign policy and those two things have just diverged.

michael barbaro

Hill testified that when Trump and Sondland pressed Ukraine to investigate the discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, they were playing directly into Russia’s hands, since Russia wants to deflect attention away from its interference.

archived recording (fiona hill) This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves. These fictions are harmful, even if they’re deployed for purely domestic, political purposes.

Ms. Warren’s crowd sizes can register as more respectable than staggering, not bad for a cold-weather spell months before the voting starts but hardly imposing in a field with several candidates, from Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg to the former tech executive Andrew Yang, who can reliably fill event halls themselves.

In polls, Ms. Warren still struggles with nonwhite voters and those without college degrees. On the trail, where the most engaged voters often sound and behave like pundits, she has drawn skepticism from a peculiar class of Democrat: the progressive who fears others are not so progressive.

“If she isn’t willing to moderate some of her views, I don’t think she can beat Trump,” said Jim Butler, 73, a retired teacher from Dubuque wearing a “Nevertheless, She Persisted” shirt. “She scares some people. Doesn’t scare me, I’m as progressive as she is. But I’m not sure she can change people’s views as fast as she needs to change them.”

Ms. Warren’s standard remarks now seem to anticipate this argument. “It’s easy to give up on big ideas,” she said at an outdoor rally in Concord last week, her breath visible after certain punctuated syllables on a 25-degree afternoon. “It’s easy to sound so sophisticated when you do.”

But if you abandon your big ideas, she suggested, what have you won if you win ?

Hours later, at a forum for union members a short walk away, Ms. Warren put it like this: “I’m not running for president so I get to try on the outfit.”

I remember in history class, must have been a junior, it was during the impeachment process of President Clinton or all the scandal, everything that was going on. And I remember the teacher was just kind of riffing on this, and he said, you know, would anybody here ever want to be president or want to run for office, seeing what a mess and what an ugly place Washington was? And I just — maybe involuntarily, my hand went up. And from then on, it became that the running joke of the class that I’d wind up running for president. And then by the time I got to college, they had this Institute of Politics at Harvard, and every day, there’d be a different speaker who would come through. And I remember when I was there as a freshman, people like Donna Brazile who had just come off managing the Gore campaign and Rick Davis, who had done the same thing for McCain. And the former president of Ecuador, he’d been deposed in a coup. You’d just kind of hang around and watch them and see what they were like. The biggest realization was that they’re just people. These people who were shaping the world, people I was seeing on TV were obviously very impressive people, but they were just people. I think it changed my awareness of the fact that, on some level, I could be part of that world, too. But in a very simple sense, especially coming from Indiana, it seemed that it was a choice. You could be in elected office, or you could be an out gay person, not both, at least not where I was from. From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

Pete Buttigieg. It’s Friday, November 22. So Jeremy Peters, you cover politics for The Times, and you’ve been closely tracking Mayor Buttigieg. And in order to better understand the Democratic field of presidential candidates, we’re trying to figure out the most revealing moments in their lives. So when it comes to Pete Buttigieg, what moment should we focus on?

jeremy peters

Well, Mayor Pete has always been a candidate for whom his story, his biography is very central to his appeal to voters, and he’s got a great story to tell. He’s been elected mayor of this medium-sized town in Indiana before turning 30. He has an Ivy League pedigree. He’s been a Rhodes Scholar. He’s worked at a prestigious consulting firm. He’s gone off to Afghanistan as part of the Navy Reserves. So he has all of these components that you kind of think if you’re a voter, wow, he really stands out. There’s something unique about this guy. But at the same time, for most of his adult life, he had this nagging secret, the secret that he couldn’t confront because he thought that it would mean the end to this political career that he had spent so much time perfecting, basically since he went away to college and decided, hey, you know, I can run for president. And he doesn’t see how it’s possible for the politician with the perfect background, the perfect resume to also be open about their sexuality, in his case. So how he reconciles this inner turmoil with his very public ambition I think is a defining moment in his life, if not the defining moment.

michael barbaro

All right. Welcome to the studio.

pete buttigieg

Thank you.

michael barbaro

You’re going to sit there.

pete buttigieg

All right.

jeremy peters

So that story begins in 1982 in South Bend, Indiana where Peter Buttigieg was born.

michael barbaro

Mayor, tell me about the kind of kid that you were, growing up in Indiana?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think I was, safe to say, a little on the nerdy side. I lived in a neighborhood kind of in the middle of South Bend, close to a park where you would have as much as possible what you’d call a prototypical Midwestern kid’s upbringing, you know, playing in the park with friends, a lot of time in the house. I was really interested in baseball cards, but I was more interested in categorizing them than I was in baseball, I think. I loved science and science fiction. I loved reading, plus I was an only child. So I think it’s safe to say I had a lot of interior life going on in a fairly quiet house where it was a dog and my parents, who were both academics, and me.

michael barbaro

What was your introduction to even the idea of politics?

pete buttigieg

Politics was always in the air in our house just because my parents were very politically passionate. They really cared about what was happening. I can remember the Democratic Convention. It must have been 1988.

archived recording NBC News continues its coverage of America’s convention.

pete buttigieg

I would’ve been six years old and my parents explaining what a convention was. I remember Jesse Jackson giving a speech.

archived recording (jesse jackson) When I look out at this convention, I see the face of America — red, yellow, brown, black, and white. We are all precious in God’s sight, the real rainbow coalition.

pete buttigieg

And I remember my parents thinking it was important to watch the Republican Convention, too. I mean, you would stop — even though I don’t it ever crossed their mind to ever vote for a Republican.

archived recording Now let’s go down to the podium. Here is George Herbert Walker Bush addressing his convention.

pete buttigieg

Everything in the house would kind of stop when it was time to watch what was playing out.

archived recording Thank you.

michael barbaro

At what moment in this early phase of your life did you go from just watching this and maybe finding it very fascinating to feeling really drawn to it?

pete buttigieg

Well, when I got to college, it felt like the Republicans and the Democrats, at the time, it’s crazy to think about now, polarized as we are. But what it felt like when I showed up as a freshman on campus was that the two parties were converging and not necessarily in a good place, that you had this kind of center-right and center-left, both of them very committed to growth in business, but it seemed not very committed at all to some of the questions of how we take care of vulnerable people around the country. And I think there’s a moment for any kind of well-spoken or intelligent young person watching the news when you see a senator or a candidate saying something or doing something and you think, well, that’s not right. I could do that. I could do it different. Now, you might be wrong. They might be way more sophisticated than you are, and you can’t see it. Or you might be right, and it might well be the case that what they’re saying is just not right. But I certainly had that feeling reinforced when I saw these figures come to campus, some of whom were extremely impressive, but none of whom seemed like they were on a different plane of existence. They were just people.

michael barbaro

So at this point, a year or two into Harvard, have you made up your mind that you were probably going to find a way to have a career in politics?

pete buttigieg

I knew I wanted a career that involved policy. I don’t think I’d figured out for sure that that meant running. Plus, you know, when I thought about it, even well before I was coming to terms with the fact that I was gay, I knew that I had no political connections at home. I had an unpronounceable name, and I was a Democrat who lived in Indiana. So it was not obvious that I could overcome some of the obstacles toward running. But I think it’s safe to say by the time I graduated, I had some sense that I could see myself doing it.

michael barbaro

Well, I want to talk to you about that realization of your sexuality in particular. Obviously, your candidacy is historic in a couple of different ways, and among those is the fact you’re the first major party presidential candidate who is openly gay. And so I want to ask you about that part of your identity. When did you sense that you were gay? When did that realization start to dawn on you?

pete buttigieg

I think it depends what you mean by realization, right? There are things you could point to going way back, certainly a fascination I had with a classmate when I was about 12 that, in hindsight, is very obviously a crush. But I was not willing to think of it that way, although some part of me must have — I mean, I wasn’t stupid either, right? So you have this kind of awareness that was definitely there by the time I was hitting middle school. But taking a word like gay and applying it to myself, I was still years away from being able to do that, even in my own mind.

michael barbaro

Well, what did you do with those feelings?

pete buttigieg

I guess I packed them up, yeah.

michael barbaro

Packed them up —

pete buttigieg

Not much would be the best answer.

michael barbaro

Pack them up and put them where?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I don’t know how these things work, even in your own mind. I just didn’t explore them. That’s for sure. First of all, there were not a lot of out gay people that I knew as such growing up. I mean, in high school, it was exactly zero. There was just no sense of gay life or a gay community. And when I got to college, that’s when the kind of internal battle was starting to heat up.

michael barbaro

Why?

pete buttigieg

I think because you just can’t escape it. I mean, my god, you’re in college, right? I mean, any feelings you have, especially in the romantic department, are going to start asserting themselves even more fiercely than they have when you get to college. For a lot of people, it’s a big part of what you spend college on.

michael barbaro

Right. So how did you deal with it?

pete buttigieg

Same way I dealt with it up to then, just packed it away. Dated women, remarkable women. Because I enjoyed these relationships, I think I could defer facing the fact that that wasn’t the same as what it was to be in love with somebody.

michael barbaro

And your political ambition was already solid at that point?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I still didn’t know exactly where it would take me or what it would mean, but I think by then, I knew that there was a good chance I was going to be running for office in my adult life. But at that point, I’m still clinging to some kind of hope, however vanishing, that maybe I’m straight or I’m bisexual and I can just not worry about the gay part. I think when I thought about my career, certainly when I talked about my future and how I was going to be involved, I wasn’t even thinking about the possibility that that would come into contact with this developing side of me. But I’m sure to the extent that I thought what it would mean to come to terms with the fact that I was at very least different and, as became increasingly clear, gay, that one of the things that would have kept that in its corner was the simple fact that that didn’t fit with any of the other things I wanted to do in life, not just a career, but a family. I wanted to get married. I wanted to have kids. From my perspective, you could be married and have kids or you could be gay, not both.

michael barbaro

You graduated in 2004. That — correct me if I’m wrong. That’s the year when Massachusetts —

pete buttigieg

That’s right.

michael barbaro

— legalizes gay marriage.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

archived recording The court today, as you know, in a 4-3 advisory opinion to the Senate has a rule that in a November 18, 2003 decision, they meant marriage. They meant equality. They meant that the Commonwealth may no longer deny marriage rights to same-sex couples, including —

michael barbaro

So I say that only to try to understand, are you falling behind the culture, in a sense? Are you ignoring some of the signs that these things are changing?

archived recording Marriage and only marriage will be enough to satisfy the requirements of the Massachusetts Constitution.

pete buttigieg

Well, the thing is I wasn’t from Massachusetts. I was in Massachusetts for a while, but I never felt like I was from there. And nothing against Massachusetts, but I realized pretty quick after turning up at Harvard that I didn’t belong there either.

michael barbaro

Why not?

pete buttigieg

It was just — it was just a different culture. I didn’t realize that. I didn’t realize that I was Midwestern until I left the Midwest. And just little things, cultural things, the way — I don’t know, the way people interact, what’s expected of you. Once I got there, I realized that socially, I was way more Midwestern than I thought.

michael barbaro

So take me from graduating from Harvard to your decision to join the Navy Reserves.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so it starts with 9/11. Actually, it starts before 9/11. There’s this family tradition of serving in the military. There’s a painting hanging on the wall of my parents’ house of a relative, a great uncle who I kind of idolized in theory. He was an Army Air Corps pilot. And so I had this idea, this maybe romantic idea, of being in the military, and then it never really became real. But I remember on 9/11 thinking, oh, well, war isn’t just a thing that happens in other places or in other periods of history. Like, war has come to my generation, and thinking, at least in the back of my head, that that might mean I would be involved, but not taking any steps to do that. But that turned into more and more of a nagging feeling when some friends of mine started to serve. A friend of mine from college shared with me just before we graduated that he had decided to join the Navy Reserve. I was fascinated. And then when I was talking to someone about applying for the Rhodes Scholarship and how I wanted to talk about my interest in public service and to the faculty member who was giving advice to students, and just said, pointedly, like, you might want to really think about how you’re going to say that, knowing that you’re going to be competing against people from the military academies. Oh yeah, that’s true. Like, my chest thumping about caring about public service feels a lot smaller held up against what others are doing.

michael barbaro

Do you think that was one of the things that might have drawn you to military service, knowing that to get a Rhodes, to be in that world, in that league, you know, it might be a good thing?

pete buttigieg

I think definitely that it was part of how you’re true to a culture of service. And also the Kennedy presidency kind of hangs over certainly the Kennedy School, as you might imagine. And that can’t be separated from his military career.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

I mean, really, it was almost an expectation that you would’ve served, up until roughly the time when I came of age when everything shifted.

michael barbaro

An expectation that you would serve —

pete buttigieg

Well, when you’re looking at the history of the people we were studying —

michael barbaro

Of presidents.

pete buttigieg

— who have made history. Yep, as presidents. And then the thing that put me over the top was this experience knocking on doors in Iowa with a couple of buddies from college who went out. We took a week off and rented a car, and it was the last few days before the Iowa caucuses, and we were volunteers for Obama. They sent us to this very rural area, some of the lowest income counties in Iowa. And it felt like any time I met a young — especially young man — it was somebody who was serving or was about to serve. And I started to realize, we had service that used to be something that bridged people together. Now it’s completely different, that if you were rural or low-income, you were highly likely to serve. If you were from a background like mine, which was middle class economically, but I’d had the chance to go to an institution like Harvard, almost nobody with that background was serving. And I began to feel like it wasn’t just this kind of thing I thought about that I hadn’t gotten around to. It was that I was part of the problem. I was part of the divide. That was the thing that kind of propelled me that last few inches toward being ready to yank open the door of the recruiting office in Indiana and say, hey, how do I sign up?

michael barbaro

I wondered, do you think you joined the military in part because you knew what it would mean for a political career?

pete buttigieg

You know, I wrestled with that because as soon as I get that question, there’s a part of me that thinks, if the answer is yes, does that mean the service wasn’t pure in some way? And I remember at the time asking myself if being in the military was as unpopular as it is today popular, would I still do it? And I want to believe the answer is yes, but there’s no way to go back and prove it. I’m not somebody who thinks that it’s, like, a prerequisite that if you want to run for office you need to have served. But I do think if you have a heart for elected office, one way to put your money where your mouth is to have been in that kind of service, too.

michael barbaro

That strikes me as a very candid answer because of course, you could just say, well, of course I would have done it, even if there was no possible —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

— political benefit.

pete buttigieg

And I want to say that. I just can’t prove it.

michael barbaro

So I want to talk about this run for mayor for just a little bit. Whenever you run for office, your character is on display. And at this point, you are keeping something quite elemental about yourself secret. Did it feel like you were hiding something?

pete buttigieg

Not really. The only time it felt that way was when there was small talk about whether I was dating, and I would crack a joke or something. We’d be sitting in a studio like this one and a radio host would ask a question. And I’d say, well, if anybody listening is into economic policy and long walks on the beach, go ahead and reach out and just kind of play the busy single person, which is what I was, except for the fact that I wasn’t actively looking for love. I was going out of my way to avoid it. But if somebody who is straight up asked me on the record, to this day, I’m not sure what I would have done.

michael barbaro

Do you think that that would have potentially cost you the mayoralty, might have kept you from being mayor or staying mayor?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I think there’s a good chance of it. There’s a reason why no — as far as I know, no out gay person had ever run for mayor of any place in Indiana.

michael barbaro

This is a state with strong Christian values, and —

pete buttigieg

— not known for progressive social outlooks on politics. And here I am, rocking up, 29 years old saying, trust me, support me. Never mind this state legislator who has earned tons of credibility in this community. Never mind this county councilman who’s the party favorite. Go with me instead. If there had been anything that looked like a skeleton or a vulnerability, I think it probably would have sunk me before I got anywhere at all.

michael barbaro

So I want to now move into this notion of you reconciling these things.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so when I first joined the Reserve, the message was kind of you’re pretty much going to go to one of these wars, and we’ll let you know which one. And so I knew that, at a certain point, it was coming. And of course, I didn’t want to take office in South Bend without a plan for this. So we had gamed it out with my team, if I get orders, here’s what you do. And when I received my orders and knew I was going for sure, I don’t think even then it occurred to me that it would have much to do with my sexuality. If anything, I was thankful that I was single, right? The hardest thing for people to deploy is the fact that you’re leaving behind somebody you love, in addition to all the professional complications. But then, the more I started getting mentally ready for going over and really thinking about what it meant, the more it started weighing on me that I didn’t have a — wasn’t coming back to a family, my parents, of course, but I wasn’t coming back to a household. And more than that, I had no idea what it was like to be in love. And the idea that I’m — here I am. I’m a grown-ass man. I own a home. I’m the mayor of my city. I’m a military officer. And if I get killed over there, I will go to my grave not knowing what it’s like to be in love. And that just made me realize how untenable the situation I was in really was. And up until then, it didn’t seem untenable, I guess because I was so busy, and I might have deferred coming out and having a dating life forever, if not for this moment where I’m thinking, shit, I could die.

michael barbaro

You wrote a letter I want to ask you about.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, you know, it’s a thing you do. I assume everybody does it. I don’t know. But it’s the thing you do when you go to war, right? You want to make sure that you have the last word on your life and leave a few instructions. So I wrote up a letter, put an envelope, put just in case on the outside. Put it in the desk drawer, would’ve been pretty easy to find if worse comes to worst. And that’s a real moment, too, because you’re sitting there staring at the screen trying to figure out how to give a short accounting of your life.

michael barbaro

And what did you say?

pete buttigieg

Well, what I said was that I wouldn’t want people to think that I’d been cheated, that obviously it’d be terrible if I didn’t come back, but I also had this amazing life where I have wonderful friendships, and I got to serve my community in a way that very few people get to do, let alone at my age, and that I’d had this very fulfilling life. And of course, it’d be too bad if something happened to me, but to keep that in perspective. But if you’re asking if there was, like, P.S. I’m gay, no.

michael barbaro

That’s kind of what I was asking. So you are deployed.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

You do not die.

pete buttigieg

Right.

michael barbaro

You come back, and you’re mayor.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

And how do you decide that it’s time to come out?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think by the time I hit the ground and I was back, I knew that I was going to come out and then it’s just — it was more how and when. I remember resenting the idea that you’re supposed to have to come out, right? Straight people don’t have to come out. Why do I? And then, while I’m in the process of figuring this out —

archived recording Thank you all for coming. It’s been a tough week here in the Hoosier state, but we’re going to move forward.

We have this explosive controversy over Mike Pence, the Governor Mike Pence and his so-called Religious Freedom bill.

archived recording The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was about religious liberty, not about discrimination.

pete buttigieg

So suddenly, we’re on national television, my state, as the most officially anti-gay state in the country. I’m fighting him on it, of course, because it’s a terrible policy. But now, I’m fighting this terrible, anti-gay policy putatively from the perspective of a straight ally, wondering whether I’m more effective because people don’t know that I’m gay. And at the same time, knowing that this just kind of speeds things up even more that, like, it’s just a really weird position to be in, to be having all these hypothetical arguments about discrimination against gay people, when it really means me. Meanwhile, this is also the period when we realize that soon the Supreme Court is going to weigh in on marriage. I mean, all of this was happening in that early part of 2015 while I’m wrestling with how to do this. And so oddly enough, it was — — as busy as I was as mayor. Military duty actually felt like, kind of almost like a break because it was eight hour days, 40 hour week. I wasn’t used to having that much time, and so is a lot of time to sit and write and think and call friends and get advice.

michael barbaro

So you produce a plan.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, well I produced a letter, an op-ed I guess.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. What was the essential line that I’m sure you remember that you wrote?

pete buttigieg

I remember saying that it’s just part of who I am and that it has no bearing on how I do my job, that the way I do my — did my job either as an officer or as a mayor or in business had nothing to do with the fact that I was gay and that —

michael barbaro

It still sounds a little defensive.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Or maybe a little scared.

pete buttigieg

Probably. Yeah, I mean, you know, I didn’t feel like I was coming out guns blazing. I felt like I — again, part of me was bothered that I had to share this at all. Then part of me knew that it would do some good if I did, I mean, not just in my own life. That I — my main agenda was, personally, I wanted to get out there and start dating. But also that it would mean something, might mean all kinds of things to a whole bunch of different people when I came out and said this.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

I want to talk about the timing, the exact moment of the op-ed because my sense is that at this phase of your career, you’re up for re-election, right? You’ve won the primary. And winning the primary, in a sense, means you’re standing a very good shot of winning.

pete buttigieg

Depending on the year, but yeah, in South Bend, it should be.

michael barbaro

So does that mean you deliberately chose a — like, a safe, low-risk time to do this?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I would think that going into a Democratic primary would be a safer time than going into a general election. And I think also the decision to do this came by way of realizing that there is no such thing as a safe time. I was just done with not having the kind of personal life that I wanted to have.

michael barbaro

So once you come out, how does your personal life change?

pete buttigieg

Well, I started dating, and that kind of changes everything. I mean, I still had this very demanding job. You’re the mayor, and so anybody in town that you ask to have a cup of coffee is —

michael barbaro

It’s a thing.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, it’s a thing. It might be misinterpreted. You could cross some line without meaning to. I mean, most of the people I interacted with were either people who needed something from me, people I needed something from or people who worked for me. So it’s not, like, a very healthy pool for dating is what I’m saying. And I remember thinking there were all these kind of city fathers who, early on in my time as mayor, seemed determined to fix me up with their daughters. And I remember just thinking, like, where are you now? Did none of you have, like, a son or a nephew or something? So I did what millennials do. I went online. Turns out there’s apps for all of this. There was O.K. Cupid, Tinder. The one that actually came through for me was called Hinge. And it’s supposed to serve up people that — I don’t know how the algorithm works. But I find this guy, this cute guy with a big smile, and I’m like, I want to know this guy. So we start chatting. Well, I was chatting with a lot of people, but obviously, he’s the one I remember because that was Chasten.

michael barbaro

Your future husband.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

michael barbaro

So your story, to many people, is particularly compelling one, everything we just discussed. You are a Harvard graduate, a Rhodes Scholar, you’re a veteran. You’re gay. You’re religious. And from your own description of yourself, it feels like you have been thinking about politics and preparing, to some degree, to run for president for a very long time, even though you’re quite young. And I’m sure you understand this and have heard this. That has led to this perception of a person kind of, perhaps, orchestrating a political biography. Do you ever question whether that, no matter what your intention, is — could possibly undermine the power of the story itself, however genuine?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I mean, I think we’re conditioned to not like the idea of somebody who sat around thinking all their lives about how to become president. And I don’t view myself that way, although I get that that story has been written around me. Although, I also don’t know what it is we expect, that somebody kind of gets struck by lightning and then they turn into somebody who might become president. We all have these paths, right, that bring us to where we are. And I think anybody in professional life or even social life thinks about the story that you tell about yourself. At the end of the day, I’m not doing this because I have this personal need to be in elected office or to be the president. I’m not coming at the presidency as a thing that I’d like to occupy. I’m coming at it as this way to do something that I think I’m able to do. And I think it’s helpful in the sense that I could also have a very happy life doing something else. And oddly, I think that — that helps prepare me to do what’s required to do this. And this is advice I give talking to students, too. Imagine somebody is being sworn in, an ambitious, talented person kind of in the middle of their career is being sworn in as an assistant secretary in the State Department for the Middle East. And then imagine if that person has got there one of two ways. In kind of universe A, it’s a person who woke up one day in high school and said, I want to be the assistant secretary for the Middle East, and took the right courses and got the right jobs and had the right fellowships and wrote the right papers and did everything in order to occupy that title. And the other person is somebody who said, I — woke up in high school and said, I want to be the person who makes the United States a force toward peace in the Middle East. And they don’t know what that’s going to mean, and maybe it means they start out becoming an activist or maybe they’re an academic or maybe they’re a civil servant or whatever. But by whatever winding path, they wind up in this job, right? Which of those two scenarios is going to lead to somebody who’s better equipped to take that job they’ve been handed? I’ve got to think it’s the latter. And so what I’ve tried to do in my life is to prepare myself to be useful to others. And yes, I think that, in all likelihood, means in a form that involves holding office or seeking office or at least public life where I speak to lots of people, sometimes millions at the same time. But it’s not about, necessarily, having one title or another. And so I think if you overthink it, that’s where you start to lose the fidelity to what it is that would guide you when you actually get what you’ve been chasing for a long time. Jeremy, what do we learn from Mayor Pete Buttigieg about the way he reconciled his political ambition with this essential fact about himself that he feared would endanger that ambition?

jeremy peters

I think we learn a lot about his decision-making process, not just how he internalizes decisions personally, but how he thinks about them in the longer arc of a political career. And he’s been very intentional all along the way about choosing certain endeavors that he thinks would benefit a long-term political career. Now some people would think, on the one hand, that’s too calculating. I don’t want somebody who’s thought about being president since he was a teenager. And, you know, in the era when voters seemed to prize authenticity in their political figures, they could see that as inauthentic. On the other hand, the decision that he made to wait seems to have borne out to his benefit. I mean, here he is, the first openly gay candidate for president of the United States who has a legitimate shot at being his party’s nominee. Look at where he is in the Democratic primary right now. He’s rocketed to the top of the polls. He’s brought in all this money in large part because he’s gay, and that opened a lot of doors with Democratic donors. He’s heading into the Iowa caucuses in the lead by some measures. But we won’t know if his decision to wait actually was the right one until people start voting. So it seems to have worked out well for him right now, but no one’s cast a single vote. And we don’t know how voters in the Democratic primary are going to react. We certainly don’t know how voters in a general election are going to react. So we’re just not going to know until Democratic voters have their say.

michael barbaro

Mayor, when you think back to your younger self —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Not just your teenage self, but even your college self and your post-collegiate self who was so fearful about telling the world that you were gay, what do you kind of wish you could tell that person, that version of Mayor Buttigieg?

pete buttigieg

Well, back then, I would have thought this other fact, if I dared to unpack it, this fact about my life, this way in which I was different, was the thing that could multiply all the other stuff by zero, in terms of the impact I was going to have in the world, that I might very well choose that path, but that the price would be that I wouldn’t get to make a difference in public life. And if you want proof of God having a sense of humor, one of the things I’m seeing now, especially in the interactions I have on the campaign trail and the fact that this campaign is historic in a lot of ways, is that that same fact that I thought would mean never getting to this point might actually be one of the things that makes it matter the most.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

It’s a strange thing to think about that the one thing that I couldn’t control, the one thing that might have meant that it would be better not to have any aspirations related to politics at all could be the very thing that anchors the moral and emotional purpose of this entire campaign.

michael barbaro

Thank you very much.

pete buttigieg

Thanks for having me.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (fiona hill) And I did say to him, Ambassador Sondland, Gordon, I think this is all going to blow up, and here we are.

michael barbaro

In the latest public testimony before impeachment investigators, Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert on the National Security Council, recalled her growing frustration with Ambassador Gordon Sondland, as she realized he was pursuing a political agenda in Ukraine on behalf of President Trump.

archived recording (fiona hill) He was being involved in a domestic, political errand, and we were being involved in national security foreign policy and those two things have just diverged.

michael barbaro

Hill testified that when Trump and Sondland pressed Ukraine to investigate the discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, they were playing directly into Russia’s hands, since Russia wants to deflect attention away from its interference.

archived recording (fiona hill) This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves. These fictions are harmful, even if they’re deployed for purely domestic, political purposes.

Ms. Warren’s crowd sizes can register as more respectable than staggering, not bad for a cold-weather spell months before the voting starts but hardly imposing in a field with several candidates, from Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg to the former tech executive Andrew Yang, who can reliably fill event halls themselves.

In polls, Ms. Warren still struggles with nonwhite voters and those without college degrees. On the trail, where the most engaged voters often sound and behave like pundits, she has drawn skepticism from a peculiar class of Democrat: the progressive who fears others are not so progressive.

“If she isn’t willing to moderate some of her views, I don’t think she can beat Trump,” said Jim Butler, 73, a retired teacher from Dubuque wearing a “Nevertheless, She Persisted” shirt. “She scares some people. Doesn’t scare me, I’m as progressive as she is. But I’m not sure she can change people’s views as fast as she needs to change them.”

Ms. Warren’s standard remarks now seem to anticipate this argument. “It’s easy to give up on big ideas,” she said at an outdoor rally in Concord last week, her breath visible after certain punctuated syllables on a 25-degree afternoon. “It’s easy to sound so sophisticated when you do.”

But if you abandon your big ideas, she suggested, what have you won if you win ?

Hours later, at a forum for union members a short walk away, Ms. Warren put it like this: “I’m not running for president so I get to try on the outfit.”

It was the question-and-answer portion, and hands were shooting up inside a hotel conference room. A woman stood to ask about Medicare for all, sounding anxious about Ms. Warren’s proposal. The candidate nodded.

“Good!” she began. “So, I appreciate the question.”"

But she said Mr. Biden and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who has also proposed a public option, are more appealing to her because they are more realistic about long-term spending.

“They’re great ideals,” Ms. Downing said of the Warren and Sanders’ “Medicare for all” plans, “but I’m just not sure we can pay for it.”

The public option plans offered by Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg would require much less federal spending than Ms. Warren’s $20.5 trillion proposal to provide generous health benefits, at no cost, to all Americans. Mr. Biden has estimated his plan would cost $750 billion over 10 years; Mr. Buttigieg has said his version, which he likes to call “Medicare for all who want it,” would cost $1.5 trillion.

Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg ’s plans would automatically enroll uninsured Americans in the new government health plan and allow anyone else to opt in if they wished. Both candidates would offer more generous premium subsidies than the Affordable Care Act provides and cap people’s premium costs at 8.5 percent of their income. People with premium subsidies would have deductibles of roughly $1,000 or less. Mr. Buttigieg’s plan would go a step further, retroactively enrolling anyone who had remained uninsured but ended up sick.

Although most of the other Democrats who qualified for Wednesday’s debate support the idea of a public option, few have released detailed proposals. Some candidates, like Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur, say they hope a public option would lead to “Medicare for all;” others, like Ms. Klobuchar and Tom Steyer, a former hedge fund investor and a billionaire, consider it an end in itself.

The public option that Ms. Warren has proposed as a bridge to her “Medicare for all” plan would go further. It would be free for all children and for households with incomes at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, which is currently about $51,000 for a family of four. For people who earn more, premiums would be capped at 5 percent of income; there would be no deductibles and “modest” out-of-pocket costs. Ms. Warren has not said how much this public option plan would cost the government, but it would be considerably less than “Medicare for all;” during Wednesday’s debate she said it would cover 135 million people — about 40 percent of the population — for free."

Mr. Bloomberg’s message, at the start, is leaning heavily into his biography as a business executive and as the mayor of New York City starting in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. His advisers acknowledge that he is far less known to voters than the leading Democratic candidates. His debut television commercial stressed his credentials as a self-made executive — “a middle-class kid who made good” — and his political advocacy on core Democratic concerns like gun control and climate change, as well as on economic development and public health issues like smoking. Those issues, his advisers say, will all be central to his candidacy.

While Mr. Bloomberg is a political moderate, his opening message also borrowed in some respects from the anti-Washington rhetoric of the Democratic Party’s populist wing, led by progressives like Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. “I know how to take on the powerful special interests that corrupt Washington,” Mr. Bloomberg said in his statement on Sunday. “And I know how to win.”

I think that is exactly how this country is going to have to go on that issue.

michael barbaro

It’s Friday, December 6. Alex Burns, why this moment?

alex burns

Bernie Sanders is such an unusual character in American politics, as a lifelong socialist and left wing activist who has endured for decades as a major political figure, and who has become a leading presidential candidate. And to understand how he got from, really, the fringes of American politics to the absolute forefront, you have to go back to this moment in the early 1980s where he becomes mayor of Burlington, where he figures out how to take those ideas and actually win elections with them, and then govern. This is a period I’ve been spending a lot of time on in my own reporting because it’s just such a vital formative experience for Sanders. And so the story starts with the turn of the 1970s as Bernie Sanders arrives in Vermont with a whole lot of left wing ideas, not a whole lot of local connections, and links up with a new marginal political party called the Liberty Union.

bernie sanders

And that party had been formed around opposition to the war in Vietnam, and in the fight for economic justice. It’s a very small party in a very small state.

michael barbaro

Bernie Sanders starts showing up to Liberty Union meetings, and the party identifies him as the man they want to run for a U.S. Senate seat in 1971.

bernie sanders

And it was a very interesting campaign, and so forth, and so on. I got two percent of the vote.

michael barbaro

He loses that election, but then he has gotten the electoral bug.

bernie sanders

A year later, there was the general election. I ran for governor of the state, I got one percent.

michael barbaro

He loses again.

bernie sanders

Then I ran for Senate again against Pat Leahy, as Leahy often reminds me, and I got four percent.

michael barbaro

And again, he loses. I’m seeing a pattern here.

bernie sanders

Yes.

michael barbaro

It is loss, after loss, after loss. And while he’s running and losing, he has a series of odd jobs.

bernie sanders

I was doing some writing. I was banging nails, doing a little bit of carpentry work.

michael barbaro

He also had a job putting together newsreels and educational film strips about history for school kids.

bernie sanders

That’s before video. For younger people, there was a thing called film strips. I won’t go through what they were, photographs and sound. And I did most of the work myself, had a little bit of help, photography and so forth. It was lot of fun, actually.

michael barbaro

He sells these films to schools in the region, and he also spends time putting together a project that he’s personally quite invested in and proud of.

archived recording If you are the average American who watches television 40 hours a week, you have probably heard of such important people as Kojak and Wonder Woman. Strangely enough, however, nobody has told you about Eugene Debs, one of the most important Americans of the 20th century.

michael barbaro

Which is a film about the life of the legendary American socialist leader, Eugene Debs.

bernie sanders

Debs was a very great American. He was one of the original founders of industrial unionism, socialist party candidate for president six times, somebody I admired a whole lot.

archived recording (eugene debs) The ruling class has always taught and trained you to believe it to be your patriotic duty to go to war, and to have yourself slaughtered at their command. But in all the history of the world, you the people have never had a voice in declaring war.

michael barbaro

So throughout the 1970s, he is this activist educator who is running campaign after campaign, and losing every time. He’s not really developing a professional or political career for himself in Vermont. But in the city of Burlington —

bernie sanders

In 1980 or so, some friends of mine came up to me. And they said, you know, there’s going to be a mayor’s election coming up in ‘81. And you know what, we checked the records, and you did pretty well running as a Liberty Union candidate. You got actually 12 percent of the vote in some of the working class districts in Burlington.

michael barbaro

So two percent, or four percent, or six percent —

bernie sanders

That was statewide. But in Burlington, we did better.

michael barbaro

You were doing better.

bernie sanders

Yeah. So we got a bunch of people together, and they said, O.K., we’ll do it.

archived recording Bernie Sanders, a Brooklyn born self-described socialist running for mayor for the first time in 1981, running against a Democratic old guard that had run the city for a decade.

michael barbaro

When Sanders becomes a candidate for mayor, he is facing off against a powerful Democratic establishment. Burlington at this point, for decades has been essentially a one party town with a relatively conservative Democratic ruling clique that has just had a hammerlock on city politics. The incumbent mayor is not seen by anybody as vulnerable, to the point that the Republicans don’t even field a candidate against him. He’s also up against, just a culture of apathy when it comes to municipal elections. People generally don’t show up to vote for mayor, or for other city offices. So Bernie Sanders and this kind of ragtag group of academics and activists and intellectuals band together to try to figure out how to crack a city election in a place where nobody like them has ever won before.

bernie sanders

You would literally not believe if I told you how little we knew about politics. At the end of the day, I mean, real politics. It’s one thing to run for statewide office knowing you’re not going to win and get on our radio show and talk about issues, which I could do, but the nitty-gritty of politics.

michael barbaro

So as a newcomer to city politics, Bernie Sanders runs a different kind of campaign from the campaigns he’s run before. This isn’t about 30,000 foot ideological issues, like when he was a protest candidate for the Senate.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Ruth, you’re a volunteer worker at the old North end food co-op here in Burlington. archived recording Right. We’re on disability, social security. archived recording (bernie sanders) You got cut from $131 to — archived recording $48. archived recording (bernie sanders) And what was the justification for that? How do they expect you to live on the difference? archived recording They don’t care.

michael barbaro

This is a ground level campaign that’s waged over really concrete kitchen table issues that are relevant, he hopes, to a wide array of constituencies in the city that feel like they’ve been left out by the existing power structure.

bernie sanders

We had a lot of support in, for example, low income housing projects from people were getting a raw deal from the city that ran the projects. We had support from environmental groups. We had support from one group in the south end of the city. There was going to be a major highway going right through the neighborhood, and they said, we don’t like that.

michael barbaro

So Sanders is gaining some real support in this race. He’s not a trivial candidate, but still, the powers that be in Burlington do not see him as a threat to win this election. Let me talk about election night. What was the story of that night for you?

bernie sanders

Well, when I walked in on election day, I was of two opinions. Number one, that we would lose very heavily. And the newspapers, some guy, a newspaper writer was covering it, he said, the odds of Sanders winning are about 100 to one. That was literally what they wrote. So either we were doing something magical, or we would lose overwhelmingly. What I did not anticipate is that on election night, I think the results were, we were ahead by 14 votes. And after the recount, 10 votes. That, I did not expect.

archived recording Many people in Burlington are still in a state of shock following that city’s most stunning political upset in memory last night.

michael barbaro

The press reports from election night describe him as stunned, and then elated that he wins. And he wins by the absolute narrowest of margins, just ten votes.

alex burns

Ten votes.

archived recording Bernard Sanders, one of the founders of the Liberty Union Party, and a consistent loser in previous quests for elective office, was now the big winner. Considered by many to be unelectable because of his so-called radical views, Mr. Sanders put together an unlikely coalition of supporters and edged the ten year incumbent Gordon Paquette.

michael barbaro

So your strategy had worked. When you take office, how did becoming an elected official, the day to day reality of it, match your expectations of the power of winning this office and being mayor?

bernie sanders

Well, we had a very unique experience.

alex burns

Bernie Sanders has pulled off an extraordinary feat. He has upended the city establishment, he has become a socialist mayor in the United States at the height of the Cold War. But what happens next is he runs into a brick wall of political opposition. There is a body in Burlington, the Board of Aldermen. We would call it a city council. There are 13 members, 11 of them are either Democrats or Republicans, but their party label matters less than the fact that they are opposed to Bernie Sanders. He comes in, the powerful Democrats and the powerful Republicans both essentially say, he should not be the mayor of the city, and he will not be the mayor of the city for very long. Because we’re going to make sure that he can’t get anything done.

michael barbaro

People were trying to sabotage you?

bernie sanders

Trying to sabotage me, yes. They were trying to sabotage me. The first thing they did was to fire my secretary.

michael barbaro

They have the power to fire your secretary?

bernie sanders

Yeah, they did.

michael barbaro

So they reject his secretary. They take it back pretty quickly, but the damage to the relationship is kind of done. Not only do the board of Aldermen mess with his ability to hire a secretary, they reject all of his nominees for the top jobs in the city, city clerk, city treasurer, city attorney.

bernie sanders

And they made me run the city for the first year with exactly the administration of the guy I had beaten. You know, it’s like —

michael barbaro

You’re being neutered.

bernie sanders

Yes. So it’s like, you know, Donald Trump running his administration with Barack Obama’s appointees.

alex burns

So for really his first full year as mayor, he has a somewhat ornamental role.

michael barbaro

How are how are you thinking about this challenge?

bernie sanders

Well, their attitude, what they had said, and one of their leaders said, well, look. Bernie Sanders is a fluke. That was the word they used, and they said —

michael barbaro

Your brand of politics, everything about you, they thought was just a fluke.

bernie sanders

Right, this is an accident that should never have happened. And we will stonewall him in the first year, people will see that he can’t accomplish anything, then we’ll go back to the old ways.

michael barbaro

They’re going to drive you from office.

bernie sanders

Yeah. Well, it was a brutal year. So what we had to do was literally form a parallel city government without any money. I mean, we didn’t, couldn’t pay anybody, but we brought together a group of strong supporters and we had them helping us working on legislation and ideas. And we did everything that we could while we were being absolutely opposed by the Democratic and Republicans on the board of Aldermen. So we organized at the grass-roots level, we mobilize people. Our job was to get people involved in the political process.

michael barbaro

How did you do that?

bernie sanders

Well, I’ll tell you how we did it. Even before I took office, we had meetings on issues that people were concerned about that had been ignored for a very long time. We said, we believe in arts. You know, a city has got to be vital and alive. What do we do about the arts? What do we do about economic development? What do we do about women’s rights? So we ended up storming a council on Arts, a council on women, a council on youth. We started what we called neighborhood planning associations, which meant we gave local neighborhoods, each ward had a certain amount of money and they spent it however they wanted. So we tried to democratize it, and we brought people into the process. So it wasn’t me saying, we’re going to do A, B and C. These were people who themselves were now empowered.

michael barbaro

So you’re finding a way to essentially circumvent these aldermen who think you’re a fluke, and think they can block you by literally tapping into —

bernie sanders

Right.

michael barbaro

More voters, more people. When did you know that this strategy was actually working?

bernie sanders

Well, when hundreds of people would show up at city council meetings and demand our agenda. We were fighting for an agenda, it was being blocked by the city council. So people were upset about it, and here’s the interesting thing: We have elections for mayor then every two years, but half the board of Aldermen comes up on the odd year.

michael barbaro

So in 1982, one year after Sanders becomes mayor, seven of the 13 members of the board of aldermen are up for re-election.

bernie sanders

Essentially, there was a referendum on my administration.

michael barbaro

These elections became a chance for Mayor Sanders to go directly to the voters and ask them to replace these intransigent members of the board of aldermen with people who are friendly to him and supportive of his ideas.

bernie sanders

We ran candidates in almost every ward in the city. I probably have never worked so hard in my life. I knocked on almost every door in the city with the candidates that we were running with. And this is the winter time in Vermont, so we’re talking about 10 below zero, in zero weather. And on election night, the turnout was phenomenal for a non-mayor’s race, it was just off the charts. In five — if my memory is correct, in the five wards that we ran in, we won outright three of the wards, in all of the working class areas. And here is the most exciting thing about all of this. If you go back to the basement of City Hall and check the old records in Burlington, what you’ll find is that between 1979, that was the previous election before I won, and two years later when I was running for re-election we doubled voter turnout.

michael barbaro

He’s right, voter turnout really did rise in Burlington when Sanders got involved in city politics. And some of that is about him and his message and his political organization. Some of it is just having contested elections, elections where people file to run against the people who are already sitting in public office. When you have two choices rather than one, then yeah, more people show up to make a choice.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Good evening. We’re recording this on Friday, March 5th, and we’ve decided to get out of City Hall, get out of the office. And we’re here on the first floor the Burlington Square Mall.

michael barbaro

And he continues to engage and attempt to inspire voters in this same way, getting out in the community. He’s a highly visible mayor.

archived recording (bernie sanders) And I think what we’ll do is have some informal discussions with Vermonters as they walk past us, and as we can grab them. And we’ll see if we can get their views on some of the important issues of the day. But before we do —

michael barbaro

He creates a local television show called “Bernie Speaks With the Community,” where he is just out there and connected to your average voter.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Oops, oh, here we go. archived recording Hi, Shannon. archived recording (bernie sanders) Shannon, do you live in Burlington, Shannon? archived recording Yeah. archived recording (bernie sanders) O.K. So how are things going with you? archived recording Pretty good. I was just wondering, my mother had this idea for an indoor/outdoor amusement park by the waterfront, and she wanted — and I want to know if, is there anything going to be done about it? archived recording (bernie sanders) Well, I can’t say for sure that something will be done immediately. I think it is a good idea, and interestingly enough, your mother mentioned —

michael barbaro

It’s a highly unusual approach for a municipal politician, and especially in a city where the mayor had not been that kind of man about town previous.

archived recording (bernie sanders) O.K. The next person that we’ve kidnapped here off the streets for a few words is Jodie Baggerly. Jodie, welcome. archived recording (jodie baggerly) Well, thank you. One thing I want to appreciate, being a disabled person, is the little discount we get on our cable TVs, because I think it’s a positive point to have educational programs to be able to watch and fill our minds at periods when we are unable to get out. archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me just jump in and remind our viewers. What Jodie is talking about is, the city negotiated with the Mountain Cable Company —

michael barbaro

So Senator Sanders, in brief, what are the lessons of this moment for you?

bernie sanders

Lessons of this moment is that winning politics is grass-roots politics, that winning politics is developing coalitions of working people, of low income people, of women, of environmentalists. So coalition is, we do it from the bottom on up, and we ended up in my years as mayor taking on everybody.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

[music]

michael barbaro

So Alex, in Sanders’s telling, in the face of total political opposition and stonewalling, his solution is to essentially do what got him political power in the first place, which is go to the people, talk to the people, always the people.

alex burns

That’s his political brand as mayor, much as it’s his political brand now. And in Burlington, it’s an approach that really works for him. It establishes him as a legitimate city executive with an independent power base who cannot just be treated as an interloper in City Hall. It’s also the first of a couple stages in Mayor Sanders’ campaign to reinvent Burlington city politics. And if the first part of that is about really engaging with city politics at the ground level, the next stage after he’s been mayor for a couple of years, is to look way beyond Burlington and take on big national and international political issues, and connect them back to the local level.

archived recording If I were the president of the largest bank in Burlington, I’d be real nervous about you. archived recording (bernie sanders) Well, they may be, they may be. But I think — and they are. But I think what we’ve often talked about also, is that my powers as mayor are in many ways limited. And I have my visions as to what life should be in Vermont, in Burlington, and in the United States, but we are going to speak out, though, on national and international issues which affect the city of Burlington. For example, obviously, we’re very concerned about Mr. Reagan’s policies which are impacting devastatingly on low income and working people. But we know what our powers are within the city of Burlington.

michael barbaro

So Senator Sanders, during this period you start talking about national issues. You start talking about President Reagan, his economic policy. You start talking about foreign policy. You send letters to the leaders of Japan expressing regret for the two bombs that were dropped on that country by the U.S. What was your thinking? As you’re building this coalition locally, you start talking about issues beyond the borders of Burlington. And what is your thinking —

bernie sanders

Well, let’s be clear. 90 plus percent of our energy was dealing with local issues like reforming the police department and paving the streets. We brought a minor league baseball team into Burlington, Vermont. 95, 98 percent of our work was locally, doing what mayors are supposed to do. But as part of empowering people, what we also believed is it was important to think globally and act locally. So if we were spending a whole lot of money in Washington under Reagan, investing in military spending, or giving tax breaks to the rich, that impacted the city of Burlington. We are mayors, we need money to help us with housing. We need money to help us with roads and infrastructure, and yet Washington is spending this money on the military, or they’re busy invading another country, or whatever they’re doing. We should be speaking up on those issues.

archived recording (bernie sanders) The question is whether we use the incredible wealth and natural resources and intelligence of our society to create a decent standard of living, a decent life for all of our people in this country and abroad, or do we develop the greatest military machine for killing in the history of the world. That’s what the choice is.

bernie sanders

This was in the middle of the Cold War, and we started a sister-city program. I know the, some of the right wing media misinterprets this. But what we did is, I took a group of about a dozen people from Burlington to Yaroslavl in the old Soviet Union.

archived recording [SINGING]

bernie sanders

We had hockey teams coming out, we had doctors coming in and out, we had kids coming in and out. It really — I love the idea of sister-city programs, and it worked phenomenally well.

archived recording [SINGING] This land is your land, this land is my land —

bernie sanders

And it involved a lot of people. So the kids began to learn about Russia, and I happened to believe then, and I believe now, that if we’re going to bring peace to the world, we need a lot of cultural exchanges, we need a lot of youth exchanges. In fact, I recently proposed taking one-tenth of one percent of the military budget and putting it into cultural exchanges, which I think is a very good investment.

archived recording [SINGING] Your land, this land is my land. From California to the New York islands. From the red wood forests — archived recording (bernie sanders) I had an experience this last summer, I was invited by the government of Nicaragua to attend the sixth anniversary of their revolution. And they must have had four or 500,000 people out there listening to speeches, and the horrible thought that I had really sunk my stomach, was that kids in my own city, young kids, working class kids, might be asked by this president to go to Nicaragua to kill and get killed. And it was a horrible thought.

michael barbaro

Some of these endeavors were relatively bold. At a certain point, you go to Nicaragua. You end up meeting with the leader of the Sandinistas. And I — oh, no. I’m not worried about any —

bernie sanders

No, I’m just —

michael barbaro

Oh, you’re worried about time?

bernie sanders

Yeah, we’re running. Yes, we are running — how are we doing on time?

michael barbaro

Five more minutes?

bernie sanders

I think we’re probably going to have to end it right now.

michael barbaro

Oh. No, no, no. This is not a — don’t end it on this question if that’s the issue.

bernie sanders

Well, you know, the issue is —

michael barbaro

Trust me, this is not — all I was going to asking you was, how do events like that connect to voters in Burlington? In your mind —

bernie sanders

Good, absolutely. Very good question. Well, I’ll tell you why —

michael barbaro

How does meeting with an international leader like that —

bernie sanders

I’ll tell you why it does. Because I believe we have to empower people. One of the things we did is, we said to people, speak out on national and international issues. Yes, the mayor of the city of Burlington can’t determine the defense budget. But if we rally people all over the country speaking out on these issues, then the members of Congress and U.S. senators will hear that. So to answer your question, this is just another mechanism that we had to say to people, you have a voice. Do you think we should be spending more money on nuclear weapons? Vote on it. Talk about it. So all of this has to do with empowering people to understand that in a democracy, they can determine the future.

michael barbaro

Alex, what do you make of that?

alex burns

That is really the essence of the Bernie Sanders approach to politics, that the most important thing a political leader can do is give voice to people’s deepest concerns and frustrations, and encourage people to give voice to it themselves. And if there is a gap between what that political leader is expressing or channeling, and what he can actually accomplish, it’s almost irrelevant, that the act of expression and engagement is the most important thing. And what happens when you draw people in on an issue like climate change, or the Reagan administration’s policies in Central America, is they become politically activated in a way that then transforms politics closer to home at the local level.

michael barbaro

And Sanders did eventually articulate what you’re describing, but not before he got frustrated with me and seemed to indicate he might end the interview when I mentioned Nicaragua. What do you think that that’s about?

alex burns

Well first of all this is a really charged moment in his early career and in American politics. There has been a revolution in Nicaragua. Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas are a left wing revolutionary movement that overthrows a repressive regime. They are seen as dangerous by the Reagan administration because they are so left wing, and the Republicans in Washington prop up a brutal right wing militia to fight the Sandinistas. Bernie Sanders is one of many Americans on the left who get involved at that point in demonstrating in favor of the Sandinistas, or against Ronald Reagan. Except Sanders takes it considerably further when he actually goes to Nicaragua, shakes hands with Ortega himself. This is a story that someone in Sanders’s position probably ought to be able to explain. Or at least you would think he would feel comfortable explaining it. And what I find somewhat confounding as a reporter is how much he resents even the prompt to go into his thinking at the time and to reflect a little bit on some of the things about his support for the Sandinistas that may not look as justifiable in retrospect. He doesn’t want to do that. My sense is that, at the heart of it for him, is this sense that even asking the question is a kind of red baiting, that it reflects the way the political establishment — and he very much lumps the media in with the political establishment, is out to get him. Much as it was in Burlington, much as he believes it was in the 2016 campaign. This is a guy who in his early days as mayor was described by a fellow elected official as representing the fungus of socialism. He is somebody who is very, very sensitive to anything he perceives as the charge that he is not just a populist, not just very liberal, but this wildly outside the mainstream dangerous radical. And when you raise Nicaragua, I do think that’s the nerve that it hits.

michael barbaro

So that there’s no misunderstanding, those who listen and ask about Nicaragua, I want to give you a chance to make sure that there’s no confusion for any listener who’s casually checking in.

bernie sanders

All right —

michael barbaro

The question is, was there anything about Daniel Ortega that —

bernie sanders

Let me just say this.

michael barbaro

You knew at the time that gave you pause.

bernie sanders

Well, what gave me pause was that the United States at that time, as you may recall. I don’t know, do you remember —

michael barbaro

I was a student.

bernie sanders

Who the president was before Ortega? A dictator named Somoza who was a dictator, a very bad guy supported by the United States of America. Then Ortega came to power, the Sandinistas came to power, and the United States intended to do what it had done in many instances. You are aware the United States has a habit of overthrowing governments in Latin America.

michael barbaro

Yes.

bernie sanders

I didn’t think that was a good idea. Didn’t think it was a good idea then, and I didn’t think it was a good idea now. So we worked against American intervention. So we went there to say, as part of a national movement, that the United States should not be involved.

michael barbaro

Right.

bernie sanders

About overthrowing small governments.

michael barbaro

And for the record, in ‘85, were you aware of any human rights issues or abuses by Ortega?

bernie sanders

Well, we were aware that this was a very controversial moment, having taken over from a dictatorship. We were also aware that the United States at that time was supporting many governments in Latin America who were much more brutal than Ortega was.

alex burns

What you hear there is such an evasiveness about assessing the Ortega government on its own merits, that he really wants to talk about his advocacy around Nicaragua exclusively as a repudiation of Reagan, and not as an endorsement of what was going on there. And if you look at his comments and activities at the time, that’s not quite right. He was more explicitly supportive of what the Sandinistas were doing then just going there as a sort of anti-interventionist advocate. But in fairness to Sanders, this was not a fringe position at the time. Support for the Sandinistas has obviously not necessarily aged as well as Bernie Sanders might have expected it to politically, and that’s I think where you hear his real discomfort talking about it in the context of this campaign.

michael barbaro

But in taking this trip and talking about it the way he does, he is living his creed, essentially.

alex burns

Exactly. It is using all the levers of his power and public influence as an elected official to weigh in on this subject that is about as distant, literally, from Burlington as you can get.

[music]

michael barbaro

As this strategy is being deployed, you’re winning your fourth term as mayor. And you go on, successfully this time, to run for statewide office. The House, the Senate, and then, of course, you run for president 2016, now again in 2020. In each of these campaigns and each of these moments, you’re building larger and more powerful coalitions of voters. And given that history and your success in doing that, what do you think is the big lesson from this early phase? Why do you think it is that when we went to Alex Burns and asked him this question, and he said, you have to go back to ‘81, you have to go back to Burlington to understand Senator Sanders and this campaign and this moment. Why is he right, why do we have to go back to that race and that moment?

bernie sanders

Politics in America has been very much from the top on down. You still read articles in The New York Times where wealthy donors gathered today at a hotel to express concern about the Democratic candidates. Who cares about wealthy donors? We have over 1.1 million Americans who have made donations to our campaign. And they’re not wealthy, these are working class people. They’re teachers, they’re workers at Amazon, they’re workers at Walmart. What I believe then and what I believe now, the way you transform society is from the bottom on up. You talk about issues that are relevant to working people, issues that are relevant to low income people, issues that are relevant to young people, and you grow the voter base. So what I pointed out to you, maybe the most important thing that we did, is from 1979 to 1983, we doubled, doubled the number of people voting. And what we’re trying to do in this campaign right now —

michael barbaro

Is parallel.

bernie sanders

Is to significantly increase the voter turnout by talking to people who don’t vote. In Burlington, what happened is low income and working class people saw that government could work for them. And they said, oh my God, I never knew that. My kids now have a program, we have an after school program they didn’t have. We have a child care center we didn’t have. Our streets are getting paved, snow is getting moved. I didn’t know that — we’re going to go out, we’re going to support Bernie, and we’re going to support the candidates that he wants for Board of Aldermen. And now what we have to do in this country, which has one of the lowest voter turnout rates of any major country on earth, is to reach out to those working people, reach out to those young people. And when they start participating in the political process, that is the political revolution.

michael barbaro

If you become president, the question will be, sure, you talked about national and international issues when you were mayor, but there was no real expectation that you could change the course of events as a single mayor of a town in Burlington. If you become president, that expectation will be real and urgent and present. So are we to understand that if you run into political obstacles as president, that your strategy will be to call upon the expanded electorate that you have created and turned that into a political force that you would then, all of what you did in Burlington with the Board of Aldermen?

bernie sanders

Yes. Well, it’s not an if. That is exactly what is going to happen. When we talk about the need to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to every person through a Medicare for all, single-payer program, the only way that’s going to happen is when millions of people stand up and take on the insurance companies and the drug companies. When we talk about transforming our energy system to save the planet from the devastation, absolute devastation of the global crisis regarding climate change, the only way that happens is when millions of people stand up to take on the fossil fuel industry. So on all of the issues we are talking about, that’s what the political revolution is about. It’s saying that we’re going to mobilize millions of people to stand up for an agenda that works for working families. And when they do that, there will be no stopping them. We will be able to create a government and an economy that works for all, not just the one percent.

michael barbaro

Alex, what do you think of that theory?

alex burns

Well, the coalition that he’s trying to build as a presidential candidate is such an echo of what he accomplished in Burlington. And his theory is, they are going to show up for him in a way they wouldn’t show up for any other candidate because he is speaking to their concerns directly. And Sanders has plenty of reason to expect that might really be the case. He has charted this remarkable ascent as a national political figure on the strength of this coalition and mainstreamed a set of socialist and quasi-socialist ideas that were seen as really outside the mainstream when he started campaigning on them decades ago, into the center of one of the country’s two major political parties. The question for someone like Bernie Sanders is, does that theory work in a general election on a national scale? Can you really bring in that many new people into the political process where there already are a whole lot of people who vote, and who have pretty vested interests in the context of an American election? Can you speak in the way he does to the concerns of working class people without alienating millions of people who already vote for the Democratic Party, and don’t necessarily share that world view? And could you, as the president, use that exact same playbook, that exact same coalition to master Washington and break a Republican Senate in the same way that he transformed Burlington and broke a city council?

In interviews, voters rejected the idea that racial representation equated to change.",2019-11-25,The New York Times,Black Voters to Black Candidates: Representation Is Not Enough,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/25/us/politics/2020-election-black-voters.html,"ATLANTA — Chyna Hester knew what she was supposed to say.

The 20-year-old Spelman College student had just attended a “Black Women’s Breakfast” featuring Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate and the second black woman elected to the United States Senate . And speaker after speaker had explicitly argued that black women should support Ms. Harris and leap at the opportunity to elevate someone with their lived experience.

But after the event on Thursday, as Beyoncé’s “Brown Skin Girl” played in the background, Ms. Hester made a sheepish admission: Ms. Harris was not her preferred choice. There were policy reasons — Ms. Harris has not rolled out a proposal on student debt cancellation, which is Ms. Hester’s top issue. But there was also something else. Even at the historically black all-women’s college that Ms. Hester attends, supporting Ms. Harris was a particularly uncool thing to do.

“It’s hard, you know. On social media, there’s a different meme about her every day,” Ms. Hester said. “A lot of young people don’t support her.”

“Why aren’t black voters supporting the black presidential candidates?” is an overly simplistic question. Like all voting blocs, black voters have diverse priorities that crisscross the ideological spectrum, creating fault lines across regions, generations and economic class.

(Ms. Gabbard, who did not complete the survey, has also said she supports restrictions in the third trimester.) Several candidates emphasized that less than 1 percent of abortions happen that late, often because of life-threatening conditions or severe fetal abnormalities.

Amy Klobuchar’s campaign did not fully answer the question, saying she believed “any restrictions must be consistent with Roe v. Wade.”

Roe allowed near-total bans in the third trimester as long as there was an exception for life- or health-threatening situations. Planned Parenthood v. Casey replaced the trimester framework with one based on viability, which can start in the late second trimester.

An emboldened defense

For years, the battle over the Supreme Court has been conducted in code. Republicans denounced “judicial activism” and Democrats called for justices who would “respect precedent” — that they were talking about one precedent in particular remaining unsaid.

Not anymore.

In May, Kirsten Gillibrand vowed to nominate only judges who would uphold Roe v. Wade. Though she is no longer in the race, her pledge is: All of the candidates who completed the survey said they would “require judicial nominees to support Roe v. Wade as settled law.”

Mr. Biden’s campaign brought up his role in blocking Robert Bork’s confirmation to the Supreme Court in 1987, which probably would have meant the end of Roe. Mr. Biden’s objections then were more about birth control than abortion — but his eagerness now to play up the latter is telling of how profoundly the Democratic terrain has shifted."

“I’m just excited to have people clap when I come up to a podium,” she said at a Lincoln-Reagan Day Dinner in Hot Springs one night last week. “It’s very different from what I’m used to. All I can say is thank God I’m back in Arkansas.”

Ms. Sanders’s relationship with reporters reached a nadir in April after it was revealed that she had admitted under oath to investigators working for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, that her claim at a press briefing that “countless members of the F.B.I.” told her they had lost confidence in the bureau’s director, James B. Comey, was a “slip of the tongue” that was not based on any facts.

In Hot Springs, the crowd was hardly dwelling on the incident.

“The main thing I like about her is her honesty,” said Carla Shelton, a small-business owner who brought her daughter to hear Ms. Sanders speak. “She got a bad rap because people are offended that she does tell the truth. I’m 100 percent behind her.”

Ms. Sanders arrived at the dinner bearing a “Make America Great Again” cap signed by Vice President Mike Pence, which was auctioned off for $750. She warned of the “chaos” that would ensue if Democrats were allowed to “take guns out of our homes” and force “taxpayer-funded abortion on demand, anytime.”

The crowd swarmed her. Her husband, Brian Sanders, drove her home.

Many of Ms. Sanders’s former White House colleagues have left Mr. Trump’s orbit damaged if not disgraced. But Ms. Sanders appears to be living her best life back home.

After two years in a rented house in Arlington, Va., the Sanders family bought a sprawling $600,000 home in Pleasant Valley, Little Rock’s wealthiest neighborhood. She has just finished building an in-house television studio for her appearances on Fox News, where she is a paid contributor, and works on a memoir due out before the 2020 election when she is not touring the country giving paid speeches and doing some corporate consulting. Her office is decorated with political paraphernalia, including a Woman of the Year award from Virginia Women for Trump and a signed electric guitar from Mr. Huckabee, which credits her with “always rocking for her Daddy!”

But she said Mr. Biden and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who has also proposed a public option, are more appealing to her because they are more realistic about long-term spending.

“They’re great ideals,” Ms. Downing said of the Warren and Sanders’ “Medicare for all” plans, “but I’m just not sure we can pay for it.”

The public option plans offered by Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg would require much less federal spending than Ms. Warren’s $20.5 trillion proposal to provide generous health benefits, at no cost, to all Americans. Mr. Biden has estimated his plan would cost $750 billion over 10 years; Mr. Buttigieg has said his version, which he likes to call “Medicare for all who want it,” would cost $1.5 trillion.

Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg ’s plans would automatically enroll uninsured Americans in the new government health plan and allow anyone else to opt in if they wished. Both candidates would offer more generous premium subsidies than the Affordable Care Act provides and cap people’s premium costs at 8.5 percent of their income. People with premium subsidies would have deductibles of roughly $1,000 or less. Mr. Buttigieg’s plan would go a step further, retroactively enrolling anyone who had remained uninsured but ended up sick.

Although most of the other Democrats who qualified for Wednesday’s debate support the idea of a public option, few have released detailed proposals. Some candidates, like Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur, say they hope a public option would lead to “Medicare for all;” others, like Ms. Klobuchar and Tom Steyer, a former hedge fund investor and a billionaire, consider it an end in itself.

The public option that Ms. Warren has proposed as a bridge to her “Medicare for all” plan would go further. It would be free for all children and for households with incomes at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, which is currently about $51,000 for a family of four. For people who earn more, premiums would be capped at 5 percent of income; there would be no deductibles and “modest” out-of-pocket costs. Ms. Warren has not said how much this public option plan would cost the government, but it would be considerably less than “Medicare for all;” during Wednesday’s debate she said it would cover 135 million people — about 40 percent of the population — for free."

Mr. Bloomberg’s message, at the start, is leaning heavily into his biography as a business executive and as the mayor of New York City starting in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. His advisers acknowledge that he is far less known to voters than the leading Democratic candidates. His debut television commercial stressed his credentials as a self-made executive — “a middle-class kid who made good” — and his political advocacy on core Democratic concerns like gun control and climate change, as well as on economic development and public health issues like smoking. Those issues, his advisers say, will all be central to his candidacy.

While Mr. Bloomberg is a political moderate, his opening message also borrowed in some respects from the anti-Washington rhetoric of the Democratic Party’s populist wing, led by progressives like Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. “I know how to take on the powerful special interests that corrupt Washington,” Mr. Bloomberg said in his statement on Sunday. “And I know how to win.”

Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island, who helms the Democratic Governors Association, said she had spoken recently with Mr. Bloomberg and saw him as a strong candidate despite the late hour. Ms. Raimondo said the former mayor recognized he faced “long odds” in the primary, but she suggested Mr. Bloomberg could be well positioned in a general election to take on Mr. Trump’s perceived credentials as a businessman.

Lastly, I want to touch upon an issue that dear to my heart, and that is the issue of affordable health care. The people of Burlington voted overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly in support of Congress moving forward to establish a national health care system. I think that is exactly how this country is going to have to go on that issue.

michael barbaro

It’s Friday, December 6. Alex Burns, why this moment?

alex burns

Bernie Sanders is such an unusual character in American politics, as a lifelong socialist and left wing activist who has endured for decades as a major political figure, and who has become a leading presidential candidate. And to understand how he got from, really, the fringes of American politics to the absolute forefront, you have to go back to this moment in the early 1980s where he becomes mayor of Burlington, where he figures out how to take those ideas and actually win elections with them, and then govern. This is a period I’ve been spending a lot of time on in my own reporting because it’s just such a vital formative experience for Sanders. And so the story starts with the turn of the 1970s as Bernie Sanders arrives in Vermont with a whole lot of left wing ideas, not a whole lot of local connections, and links up with a new marginal political party called the Liberty Union.

bernie sanders

And that party had been formed around opposition to the war in Vietnam, and in the fight for economic justice. It’s a very small party in a very small state.

michael barbaro

Bernie Sanders starts showing up to Liberty Union meetings, and the party identifies him as the man they want to run for a U.S. Senate seat in 1971.

bernie sanders

And it was a very interesting campaign, and so forth, and so on. I got two percent of the vote.

michael barbaro

He loses that election, but then he has gotten the electoral bug.

bernie sanders

A year later, there was the general election. I ran for governor of the state, I got one percent.

michael barbaro

He loses again.

bernie sanders

Then I ran for Senate again against Pat Leahy, as Leahy often reminds me, and I got four percent.

michael barbaro

And again, he loses. I’m seeing a pattern here.

bernie sanders

Yes.

michael barbaro

It is loss, after loss, after loss. And while he’s running and losing, he has a series of odd jobs.

bernie sanders

I was doing some writing. I was banging nails, doing a little bit of carpentry work.

michael barbaro

He also had a job putting together newsreels and educational film strips about history for school kids.

bernie sanders

That’s before video. For younger people, there was a thing called film strips. I won’t go through what they were, photographs and sound. And I did most of the work myself, had a little bit of help, photography and so forth. It was lot of fun, actually.

michael barbaro

He sells these films to schools in the region, and he also spends time putting together a project that he’s personally quite invested in and proud of.

archived recording If you are the average American who watches television 40 hours a week, you have probably heard of such important people as Kojak and Wonder Woman. Strangely enough, however, nobody has told you about Eugene Debs, one of the most important Americans of the 20th century.

michael barbaro

Which is a film about the life of the legendary American socialist leader, Eugene Debs.

bernie sanders

Debs was a very great American. He was one of the original founders of industrial unionism, socialist party candidate for president six times, somebody I admired a whole lot.

archived recording (eugene debs) The ruling class has always taught and trained you to believe it to be your patriotic duty to go to war, and to have yourself slaughtered at their command. But in all the history of the world, you the people have never had a voice in declaring war.

michael barbaro

So throughout the 1970s, he is this activist educator who is running campaign after campaign, and losing every time. He’s not really developing a professional or political career for himself in Vermont. But in the city of Burlington —

bernie sanders

In 1980 or so, some friends of mine came up to me. And they said, you know, there’s going to be a mayor’s election coming up in ‘81. And you know what, we checked the records, and you did pretty well running as a Liberty Union candidate. You got actually 12 percent of the vote in some of the working class districts in Burlington.

michael barbaro

So two percent, or four percent, or six percent —

bernie sanders

That was statewide. But in Burlington, we did better.

michael barbaro

You were doing better.

bernie sanders

Yeah. So we got a bunch of people together, and they said, O.K., we’ll do it.

archived recording Bernie Sanders, a Brooklyn born self-described socialist running for mayor for the first time in 1981, running against a Democratic old guard that had run the city for a decade.

michael barbaro

When Sanders becomes a candidate for mayor, he is facing off against a powerful Democratic establishment. Burlington at this point, for decades has been essentially a one party town with a relatively conservative Democratic ruling clique that has just had a hammerlock on city politics. The incumbent mayor is not seen by anybody as vulnerable, to the point that the Republicans don’t even field a candidate against him. He’s also up against, just a culture of apathy when it comes to municipal elections. People generally don’t show up to vote for mayor, or for other city offices. So Bernie Sanders and this kind of ragtag group of academics and activists and intellectuals band together to try to figure out how to crack a city election in a place where nobody like them has ever won before.

bernie sanders

You would literally not believe if I told you how little we knew about politics. At the end of the day, I mean, real politics. It’s one thing to run for statewide office knowing you’re not going to win and get on our radio show and talk about issues, which I could do, but the nitty-gritty of politics.

michael barbaro

So as a newcomer to city politics, Bernie Sanders runs a different kind of campaign from the campaigns he’s run before. This isn’t about 30,000 foot ideological issues, like when he was a protest candidate for the Senate.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Ruth, you’re a volunteer worker at the old North end food co-op here in Burlington. archived recording Right. We’re on disability, social security. archived recording (bernie sanders) You got cut from $131 to — archived recording $48. archived recording (bernie sanders) And what was the justification for that? How do they expect you to live on the difference? archived recording They don’t care.

michael barbaro

This is a ground level campaign that’s waged over really concrete kitchen table issues that are relevant, he hopes, to a wide array of constituencies in the city that feel like they’ve been left out by the existing power structure.

bernie sanders

We had a lot of support in, for example, low income housing projects from people were getting a raw deal from the city that ran the projects. We had support from environmental groups. We had support from one group in the south end of the city. There was going to be a major highway going right through the neighborhood, and they said, we don’t like that.

michael barbaro

So Sanders is gaining some real support in this race. He’s not a trivial candidate, but still, the powers that be in Burlington do not see him as a threat to win this election. Let me talk about election night. What was the story of that night for you?

bernie sanders

Well, when I walked in on election day, I was of two opinions. Number one, that we would lose very heavily. And the newspapers, some guy, a newspaper writer was covering it, he said, the odds of Sanders winning are about 100 to one. That was literally what they wrote. So either we were doing something magical, or we would lose overwhelmingly. What I did not anticipate is that on election night, I think the results were, we were ahead by 14 votes. And after the recount, 10 votes. That, I did not expect.

archived recording Many people in Burlington are still in a state of shock following that city’s most stunning political upset in memory last night.

michael barbaro

The press reports from election night describe him as stunned, and then elated that he wins. And he wins by the absolute narrowest of margins, just ten votes.

alex burns

Ten votes.

archived recording Bernard Sanders, one of the founders of the Liberty Union Party, and a consistent loser in previous quests for elective office, was now the big winner. Considered by many to be unelectable because of his so-called radical views, Mr. Sanders put together an unlikely coalition of supporters and edged the ten year incumbent Gordon Paquette.

michael barbaro

So your strategy had worked. When you take office, how did becoming an elected official, the day to day reality of it, match your expectations of the power of winning this office and being mayor?

bernie sanders

Well, we had a very unique experience.

alex burns

Bernie Sanders has pulled off an extraordinary feat. He has upended the city establishment, he has become a socialist mayor in the United States at the height of the Cold War. But what happens next is he runs into a brick wall of political opposition. There is a body in Burlington, the Board of Aldermen. We would call it a city council. There are 13 members, 11 of them are either Democrats or Republicans, but their party label matters less than the fact that they are opposed to Bernie Sanders. He comes in, the powerful Democrats and the powerful Republicans both essentially say, he should not be the mayor of the city, and he will not be the mayor of the city for very long. Because we’re going to make sure that he can’t get anything done.

michael barbaro

People were trying to sabotage you?

bernie sanders

Trying to sabotage me, yes. They were trying to sabotage me. The first thing they did was to fire my secretary.

michael barbaro

They have the power to fire your secretary?

bernie sanders

Yeah, they did.

michael barbaro

So they reject his secretary. They take it back pretty quickly, but the damage to the relationship is kind of done. Not only do the board of Aldermen mess with his ability to hire a secretary, they reject all of his nominees for the top jobs in the city, city clerk, city treasurer, city attorney.

bernie sanders

And they made me run the city for the first year with exactly the administration of the guy I had beaten. You know, it’s like —

michael barbaro

You’re being neutered.

bernie sanders

Yes. So it’s like, you know, Donald Trump running his administration with Barack Obama’s appointees.

alex burns

So for really his first full year as mayor, he has a somewhat ornamental role.

michael barbaro

How are how are you thinking about this challenge?

bernie sanders

Well, their attitude, what they had said, and one of their leaders said, well, look. Bernie Sanders is a fluke. That was the word they used, and they said —

michael barbaro

Your brand of politics, everything about you, they thought was just a fluke.

bernie sanders

Right, this is an accident that should never have happened. And we will stonewall him in the first year, people will see that he can’t accomplish anything, then we’ll go back to the old ways.

michael barbaro

They’re going to drive you from office.

bernie sanders

Yeah. Well, it was a brutal year. So what we had to do was literally form a parallel city government without any money. I mean, we didn’t, couldn’t pay anybody, but we brought together a group of strong supporters and we had them helping us working on legislation and ideas. And we did everything that we could while we were being absolutely opposed by the Democratic and Republicans on the board of Aldermen. So we organized at the grass-roots level, we mobilize people. Our job was to get people involved in the political process.

michael barbaro

How did you do that?

bernie sanders

Well, I’ll tell you how we did it. Even before I took office, we had meetings on issues that people were concerned about that had been ignored for a very long time. We said, we believe in arts. You know, a city has got to be vital and alive. What do we do about the arts? What do we do about economic development? What do we do about women’s rights? So we ended up storming a council on Arts, a council on women, a council on youth. We started what we called neighborhood planning associations, which meant we gave local neighborhoods, each ward had a certain amount of money and they spent it however they wanted. So we tried to democratize it, and we brought people into the process. So it wasn’t me saying, we’re going to do A, B and C. These were people who themselves were now empowered.

michael barbaro

So you’re finding a way to essentially circumvent these aldermen who think you’re a fluke, and think they can block you by literally tapping into —

bernie sanders

Right.

michael barbaro

More voters, more people. When did you know that this strategy was actually working?

bernie sanders

Well, when hundreds of people would show up at city council meetings and demand our agenda. We were fighting for an agenda, it was being blocked by the city council. So people were upset about it, and here’s the interesting thing: We have elections for mayor then every two years, but half the board of Aldermen comes up on the odd year.

michael barbaro

So in 1982, one year after Sanders becomes mayor, seven of the 13 members of the board of aldermen are up for re-election.

bernie sanders

Essentially, there was a referendum on my administration.

michael barbaro

These elections became a chance for Mayor Sanders to go directly to the voters and ask them to replace these intransigent members of the board of aldermen with people who are friendly to him and supportive of his ideas.

We ran candidates in almost every ward in the city. I probably have never worked so hard in my life. I knocked on almost every door in the city with the candidates that we were running with. And this is the winter time in Vermont, so we’re talking about 10 below zero, in zero weather. And on election night, the turnout was phenomenal for a non-mayor’s race, it was just off the charts. In five — if my memory is correct, in the five wards that we ran in, we won outright three of the wards, in all of the working class areas. And here is the most exciting thing about all of this. If you go back to the basement of City Hall and check the old records in Burlington, what you’ll find is that between 1979, that was the previous election before I won, and two years later when I was running for re-election we doubled voter turnout.

michael barbaro

He’s right, voter turnout really did rise in Burlington when Sanders got involved in city politics. And some of that is about him and his message and his political organization. Some of it is just having contested elections, elections where people file to run against the people who are already sitting in public office. When you have two choices rather than one, then yeah, more people show up to make a choice.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Good evening. We’re recording this on Friday, March 5th, and we’ve decided to get out of City Hall, get out of the office. And we’re here on the first floor the Burlington Square Mall.

michael barbaro

And he continues to engage and attempt to inspire voters in this same way, getting out in the community. He’s a highly visible mayor.

archived recording (bernie sanders) And I think what we’ll do is have some informal discussions with Vermonters as they walk past us, and as we can grab them. And we’ll see if we can get their views on some of the important issues of the day. But before we do —

michael barbaro

He creates a local television show called “Bernie Speaks With the Community,” where he is just out there and connected to your average voter.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Oops, oh, here we go. archived recording Hi, Shannon. archived recording (bernie sanders) Shannon, do you live in Burlington, Shannon? archived recording Yeah. archived recording (bernie sanders) O.K. So how are things going with you? archived recording Pretty good. I was just wondering, my mother had this idea for an indoor/outdoor amusement park by the waterfront, and she wanted — and I want to know if, is there anything going to be done about it? archived recording (bernie sanders) Well, I can’t say for sure that something will be done immediately. I think it is a good idea, and interestingly enough, your mother mentioned —

michael barbaro

It’s a highly unusual approach for a municipal politician, and especially in a city where the mayor had not been that kind of man about town previous.

archived recording (bernie sanders) O.K. The next person that we’ve kidnapped here off the streets for a few words is Jodie Baggerly. Jodie, welcome. archived recording (jodie baggerly) Well, thank you. One thing I want to appreciate, being a disabled person, is the little discount we get on our cable TVs, because I think it’s a positive point to have educational programs to be able to watch and fill our minds at periods when we are unable to get out. archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me just jump in and remind our viewers. What Jodie is talking about is, the city negotiated with the Mountain Cable Company —

michael barbaro

So Senator Sanders, in brief, what are the lessons of this moment for you?

bernie sanders

Lessons of this moment is that winning politics is grass-roots politics, that winning politics is developing coalitions of working people, of low income people, of women, of environmentalists. So coalition is, we do it from the bottom on up, and we ended up in my years as mayor taking on everybody.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

[music]

michael barbaro

So Alex, in Sanders’s telling, in the face of total political opposition and stonewalling, his solution is to essentially do what got him political power in the first place, which is go to the people, talk to the people, always the people.

alex burns

That’s his political brand as mayor, much as it’s his political brand now. And in Burlington, it’s an approach that really works for him. It establishes him as a legitimate city executive with an independent power base who cannot just be treated as an interloper in City Hall. It’s also the first of a couple stages in Mayor Sanders’ campaign to reinvent Burlington city politics. And if the first part of that is about really engaging with city politics at the ground level, the next stage after he’s been mayor for a couple of years, is to look way beyond Burlington and take on big national and international political issues, and connect them back to the local level.

archived recording If I were the president of the largest bank in Burlington, I’d be real nervous about you. archived recording (bernie sanders) Well, they may be, they may be. But I think — and they are. But I think what we’ve often talked about also, is that my powers as mayor are in many ways limited. And I have my visions as to what life should be in Vermont, in Burlington, and in the United States, but we are going to speak out, though, on national and international issues which affect the city of Burlington. For example, obviously, we’re very concerned about Mr. Reagan’s policies which are impacting devastatingly on low income and working people. But we know what our powers are within the city of Burlington.

michael barbaro

So Senator Sanders, during this period you start talking about national issues. You start talking about President Reagan, his economic policy. You start talking about foreign policy. You send letters to the leaders of Japan expressing regret for the two bombs that were dropped on that country by the U.S. What was your thinking? As you’re building this coalition locally, you start talking about issues beyond the borders of Burlington. And what is your thinking —

bernie sanders

Well, let’s be clear. 90 plus percent of our energy was dealing with local issues like reforming the police department and paving the streets. We brought a minor league baseball team into Burlington, Vermont. 95, 98 percent of our work was locally, doing what mayors are supposed to do. But as part of empowering people, what we also believed is it was important to think globally and act locally. So if we were spending a whole lot of money in Washington under Reagan, investing in military spending, or giving tax breaks to the rich, that impacted the city of Burlington. We are mayors, we need money to help us with housing. We need money to help us with roads and infrastructure, and yet Washington is spending this money on the military, or they’re busy invading another country, or whatever they’re doing. We should be speaking up on those issues.

archived recording (bernie sanders) The question is whether we use the incredible wealth and natural resources and intelligence of our society to create a decent standard of living, a decent life for all of our people in this country and abroad, or do we develop the greatest military machine for killing in the history of the world. That’s what the choice is.

bernie sanders

This was in the middle of the Cold War, and we started a sister-city program. I know the, some of the right wing media misinterprets this. But what we did is, I took a group of about a dozen people from Burlington to Yaroslavl in the old Soviet Union.

archived recording [SINGING]

bernie sanders

We had hockey teams coming out, we had doctors coming in and out, we had kids coming in and out. It really — I love the idea of sister-city programs, and it worked phenomenally well.

archived recording [SINGING] This land is your land, this land is my land —

bernie sanders

And it involved a lot of people. So the kids began to learn about Russia, and I happened to believe then, and I believe now, that if we’re going to bring peace to the world, we need a lot of cultural exchanges, we need a lot of youth exchanges. In fact, I recently proposed taking one-tenth of one percent of the military budget and putting it into cultural exchanges, which I think is a very good investment.

archived recording [SINGING] Your land, this land is my land. From California to the New York islands. From the red wood forests — archived recording (bernie sanders) I had an experience this last summer, I was invited by the government of Nicaragua to attend the sixth anniversary of their revolution. And they must have had four or 500,000 people out there listening to speeches, and the horrible thought that I had really sunk my stomach, was that kids in my own city, young kids, working class kids, might be asked by this president to go to Nicaragua to kill and get killed. And it was a horrible thought.

michael barbaro

Some of these endeavors were relatively bold. At a certain point, you go to Nicaragua. You end up meeting with the leader of the Sandinistas. And I — oh, no. I’m not worried about any —

bernie sanders

No, I’m just —

michael barbaro

Oh, you’re worried about time?

bernie sanders

Yeah, we’re running. Yes, we are running — how are we doing on time?

michael barbaro

Five more minutes?

bernie sanders

I think we’re probably going to have to end it right now.

michael barbaro

Oh. No, no, no. This is not a — don’t end it on this question if that’s the issue.

bernie sanders

Well, you know, the issue is —

michael barbaro

Trust me, this is not — all I was going to asking you was, how do events like that connect to voters in Burlington? In your mind —

bernie sanders

Good, absolutely. Very good question. Well, I’ll tell you why —

michael barbaro

How does meeting with an international leader like that —

bernie sanders

I’ll tell you why it does. Because I believe we have to empower people. One of the things we did is, we said to people, speak out on national and international issues. Yes, the mayor of the city of Burlington can’t determine the defense budget. But if we rally people all over the country speaking out on these issues, then the members of Congress and U.S. senators will hear that. So to answer your question, this is just another mechanism that we had to say to people, you have a voice. Do you think we should be spending more money on nuclear weapons? Vote on it. Talk about it. So all of this has to do with empowering people to understand that in a democracy, they can determine the future.

michael barbaro

Alex, what do you make of that?

alex burns

That is really the essence of the Bernie Sanders approach to politics, that the most important thing a political leader can do is give voice to people’s deepest concerns and frustrations, and encourage people to give voice to it themselves. And if there is a gap between what that political leader is expressing or channeling, and what he can actually accomplish, it’s almost irrelevant, that the act of expression and engagement is the most important thing. And what happens when you draw people in on an issue like climate change, or the Reagan administration’s policies in Central America, is they become politically activated in a way that then transforms politics closer to home at the local level.

michael barbaro

And Sanders did eventually articulate what you’re describing, but not before he got frustrated with me and seemed to indicate he might end the interview when I mentioned Nicaragua. What do you think that that’s about?

alex burns

Well first of all this is a really charged moment in his early career and in American politics. There has been a revolution in Nicaragua. Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas are a left wing revolutionary movement that overthrows a repressive regime. They are seen as dangerous by the Reagan administration because they are so left wing, and the Republicans in Washington prop up a brutal right wing militia to fight the Sandinistas. Bernie Sanders is one of many Americans on the left who get involved at that point in demonstrating in favor of the Sandinistas, or against Ronald Reagan. Except Sanders takes it considerably further when he actually goes to Nicaragua, shakes hands with Ortega himself. This is a story that someone in Sanders’s position probably ought to be able to explain. Or at least you would think he would feel comfortable explaining it. And what I find somewhat confounding as a reporter is how much he resents even the prompt to go into his thinking at the time and to reflect a little bit on some of the things about his support for the Sandinistas that may not look as justifiable in retrospect. He doesn’t want to do that. My sense is that, at the heart of it for him, is this sense that even asking the question is a kind of red baiting, that it reflects the way the political establishment — and he very much lumps the media in with the political establishment, is out to get him. Much as it was in Burlington, much as he believes it was in the 2016 campaign. This is a guy who in his early days as mayor was described by a fellow elected official as representing the fungus of socialism. He is somebody who is very, very sensitive to anything he perceives as the charge that he is not just a populist, not just very liberal, but this wildly outside the mainstream dangerous radical. And when you raise Nicaragua, I do think that’s the nerve that it hits.

michael barbaro

So that there’s no misunderstanding, those who listen and ask about Nicaragua, I want to give you a chance to make sure that there’s no confusion for any listener who’s casually checking in.

bernie sanders

All right —

michael barbaro

The question is, was there anything about Daniel Ortega that —

bernie sanders

Let me just say this.

michael barbaro

You knew at the time that gave you pause.

bernie sanders

Well, what gave me pause was that the United States at that time, as you may recall. I don’t know, do you remember —

michael barbaro

I was a student.

bernie sanders

Who the president was before Ortega? A dictator named Somoza who was a dictator, a very bad guy supported by the United States of America. Then Ortega came to power, the Sandinistas came to power, and the United States intended to do what it had done in many instances. You are aware the United States has a habit of overthrowing governments in Latin America.

michael barbaro

Yes.

bernie sanders

I didn’t think that was a good idea. Didn’t think it was a good idea then, and I didn’t think it was a good idea now. So we worked against American intervention. So we went there to say, as part of a national movement, that the United States should not be involved.

michael barbaro

Right.

bernie sanders

About overthrowing small governments.

michael barbaro

And for the record, in ‘85, were you aware of any human rights issues or abuses by Ortega?

bernie sanders

Well, we were aware that this was a very controversial moment, having taken over from a dictatorship. We were also aware that the United States at that time was supporting many governments in Latin America who were much more brutal than Ortega was.

alex burns

What you hear there is such an evasiveness about assessing the Ortega government on its own merits, that he really wants to talk about his advocacy around Nicaragua exclusively as a repudiation of Reagan, and not as an endorsement of what was going on there. And if you look at his comments and activities at the time, that’s not quite right. He was more explicitly supportive of what the Sandinistas were doing then just going there as a sort of anti-interventionist advocate. But in fairness to Sanders, this was not a fringe position at the time. Support for the Sandinistas has obviously not necessarily aged as well as Bernie Sanders might have expected it to politically, and that’s I think where you hear his real discomfort talking about it in the context of this campaign.

michael barbaro

But in taking this trip and talking about it the way he does, he is living his creed, essentially.

alex burns

Exactly. It is using all the levers of his power and public influence as an elected official to weigh in on this subject that is about as distant, literally, from Burlington as you can get.

[music]

michael barbaro

As this strategy is being deployed, you’re winning your fourth term as mayor. And you go on, successfully this time, to run for statewide office. The House, the Senate, and then, of course, you run for president 2016, now again in 2020. In each of these campaigns and each of these moments, you’re building larger and more powerful coalitions of voters. And given that history and your success in doing that, what do you think is the big lesson from this early phase? Why do you think it is that when we went to Alex Burns and asked him this question, and he said, you have to go back to ‘81, you have to go back to Burlington to understand Senator Sanders and this campaign and this moment. Why is he right, why do we have to go back to that race and that moment?

bernie sanders

Politics in America has been very much from the top on down. You still read articles in The New York Times where wealthy donors gathered today at a hotel to express concern about the Democratic candidates. Who cares about wealthy donors? We have over 1.1 million Americans who have made donations to our campaign. And they’re not wealthy, these are working class people. They’re teachers, they’re workers at Amazon, they’re workers at Walmart. What I believe then and what I believe now, the way you transform society is from the bottom on up. You talk about issues that are relevant to working people, issues that are relevant to low income people, issues that are relevant to young people, and you grow the voter base. So what I pointed out to you, maybe the most important thing that we did, is from 1979 to 1983, we doubled, doubled the number of people voting. And what we’re trying to do in this campaign right now —

michael barbaro

Is parallel.

bernie sanders

Is to significantly increase the voter turnout by talking to people who don’t vote. In Burlington, what happened is low income and working class people saw that government could work for them. And they said, oh my God, I never knew that. My kids now have a program, we have an after school program they didn’t have. We have a child care center we didn’t have. Our streets are getting paved, snow is getting moved. I didn’t know that — we’re going to go out, we’re going to support Bernie, and we’re going to support the candidates that he wants for Board of Aldermen. And now what we have to do in this country, which has one of the lowest voter turnout rates of any major country on earth, is to reach out to those working people, reach out to those young people. And when they start participating in the political process, that is the political revolution.

michael barbaro

If you become president, the question will be, sure, you talked about national and international issues when you were mayor, but there was no real expectation that you could change the course of events as a single mayor of a town in Burlington. If you become president, that expectation will be real and urgent and present. So are we to understand that if you run into political obstacles as president, that your strategy will be to call upon the expanded electorate that you have created and turned that into a political force that you would then, all of what you did in Burlington with the Board of Aldermen?

bernie sanders

Yes. Well, it’s not an if. That is exactly what is going to happen. When we talk about the need to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to every person through a Medicare for all, single-payer program, the only way that’s going to happen is when millions of people stand up and take on the insurance companies and the drug companies. When we talk about transforming our energy system to save the planet from the devastation, absolute devastation of the global crisis regarding climate change, the only way that happens is when millions of people stand up to take on the fossil fuel industry. So on all of the issues we are talking about, that’s what the political revolution is about. It’s saying that we’re going to mobilize millions of people to stand up for an agenda that works for working families. And when they do that, there will be no stopping them. We will be able to create a government and an economy that works for all, not just the one percent.

michael barbaro

Alex, what do you think of that theory?

alex burns

Well, the coalition that he’s trying to build as a presidential candidate is such an echo of what he accomplished in Burlington. And his theory is, they are going to show up for him in a way they wouldn’t show up for any other candidate because he is speaking to their concerns directly. And Sanders has plenty of reason to expect that might really be the case. He has charted this remarkable ascent as a national political figure on the strength of this coalition and mainstreamed a set of socialist and quasi-socialist ideas that were seen as really outside the mainstream when he started campaigning on them decades ago, into the center of one of the country’s two major political parties. The question for someone like Bernie Sanders is, does that theory work in a general election on a national scale? Can you really bring in that many new people into the political process where there already are a whole lot of people who vote, and who have pretty vested interests in the context of an American election? Can you speak in the way he does to the concerns of working class people without alienating millions of people who already vote for the Democratic Party, and don’t necessarily share that world view? And could you, as the president, use that exact same playbook, that exact same coalition to master Washington and break a Republican Senate in the same way that he transformed Burlington and broke a city council?

The 20-year-old Spelman College student had just attended a “Black Women’s Breakfast” featuring Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate and the second black woman elected to the United States Senate . And speaker after speaker had explicitly argued that black women should support Ms. Harris and leap at the opportunity to elevate someone with their lived experience.

But after the event on Thursday, as Beyoncé’s “Brown Skin Girl” played in the background, Ms. Hester made a sheepish admission: Ms. Harris was not her preferred choice. There were policy reasons — Ms. Harris has not rolled out a proposal on student debt cancellation, which is Ms. Hester’s top issue. But there was also something else. Even at the historically black all-women’s college that Ms. Hester attends, supporting Ms. Harris was a particularly uncool thing to do.

“It’s hard, you know. On social media, there’s a different meme about her every day,” Ms. Hester said. “A lot of young people don’t support her.”

“Why aren’t black voters supporting the black presidential candidates?” is an overly simplistic question. Like all voting blocs, black voters have diverse priorities that crisscross the ideological spectrum, creating fault lines across regions, generations and economic class. But in interviews with more than two dozen black voters in Atlanta and across South Carolina, many articulated a particular disenchantment with the idea that racial representation equated to change, and that they should automatically back a candidate who looked like them."

(Ms. Gabbard, who did not complete the survey, has also said she supports restrictions in the third trimester.) Several candidates emphasized that less than 1 percent of abortions happen that late, often because of life-threatening conditions or severe fetal abnormalities.

Amy Klobuchar’s campaign did not fully answer the question, saying she believed “any restrictions must be consistent with Roe v. Wade.”

Roe allowed near-total bans in the third trimester as long as there was an exception for life- or health-threatening situations. Planned Parenthood v. Casey replaced the trimester framework with one based on viability, which can start in the late second trimester.

An emboldened defense

For years, the battle over the Supreme Court has been conducted in code. Republicans denounced “judicial activism” and Democrats called for justices who would “respect precedent” — that they were talking about one precedent in particular remaining unsaid.

Not anymore.

In May, Kirsten Gillibrand vowed to nominate only judges who would uphold Roe v. Wade. Though she is no longer in the race, her pledge is: All of the candidates who completed the survey said they would “require judicial nominees to support Roe v. Wade as settled law.”

Mr. Biden’s campaign brought up his role in blocking Robert Bork’s confirmation to the Supreme Court in 1987, which probably would have meant the end of Roe. Mr. Biden’s objections then were more about birth control than abortion — but his eagerness now to play up the latter is telling of how profoundly the Democratic terrain has shifted."

Re “Bloomberg Hits Democratic Presidential Race Running to the Center” (news article, Nov. 25):

I believe that Michael Bloomberg may appeal to potential crossover Republicans. As a lifelong Republican I find that our current president represents very few of my long-held beliefs. There are many Republicans around the country with the same view. Whether it is immigration, climate change or income inequality, we want solutions that are fair and humane. The current president will not provide this.

On the Democratic side, plans presented by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are much too far to the left for voters like me to support. Mr. Bloomberg, a former Republican, will hopefully present a middle ground that both Republicans and Democrats can support."

“ If you’re going to Washington, you need to do something,” he said. “If the only thing you’re going to do the whole time you’re there is try to get rid of the president, that’s a problem. I mean, Trump is not a great person, but you’ve got to get some work done.”

Other voters say they are preparing to take an even greater leap: vote for Mr. Trump after supporting Democratic congressional candidates in 2018 and Mrs. Clinton in 2016.

In the survey, 7 percent of those who supported Mrs. Clinton in 2016 said they now approved of the president’s performance — despite his personality and his Twitter account, many said.

“In 2016, I hated both” candidates, said Juli Anna California, 57, a nurse from Coral Springs, Fla. “I went with Hillary because Trump had no history as a politician.”

Mr. Trump has convinced her, though — not with his character, but with his policies.

“He’s not exactly the person I’d have as my best friend,” said Ms. California, who currently lives in Los Angeles as a traveling nurse. “But he’s a great president. Most politicians just talk about doing things, but Trump does them.”

Scott Will, 51, an equipment operator in Ligonier, Pa., also voted for Mrs. Clinton in 2016, and will vote for Mr. Trump next year. So will much of his family, union workers who had been “die-hard Democrats.” Mr. Will, who started college but left to get married before graduating, credits Mr. Trump’s trade deals and pledge to bring jobs back to the United States."

Trump has no sense of loyalty, so the thought of dropping Pence isn’t exactly going to keep him up at night. And Pence is so loyal that when Trump dumps him (probably via Twitter) he’ll just give that constipated nod of his.

Gail: And tell his wife: “Mother, it’s time to go bye-bye.”

Bret: As for Haley, she does everything Pence does in terms of her appeal to the Trump base, including with evangelical voters, and probably widens Trump’s appeal somewhat, for instance with Republican-leaning suburban women. And her new book goes out of its way to showcase how loyal she was to Trump, as opposed to people like the former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the former chief of staff John Kelly. That’s purposely designed to ingratiate herself with the Trump voters who weren’t entirely sure she was onboard the MAGA Express.

Gail: And, of course, to ingratiate herself with the president. Who I’m sure didn’t read the book, but probably got a one-paragraph summary.

Bret: Whatever Trump decides — and whatever she decides — she’s clearly setting herself up for a presidential run in 2024. She’ll be formidable. The shame is that, after being an early Trump critic, she clearly feels she can win the nomination only by drawing closer to the president, not distancing herself. It just shows how thoroughly Trump has captured and corrupted the party.

Meanwhile, Democrats! I thought that last debate was a bit of a snoozefest. The big story, it seems to me, is that Pete Buttigieg is approaching front-runner status, at least when it comes to Iowa. I’m more of a fan than you are. Can he go the distance?

Gail: Don’t think so. And it’s not a good idea. We just talked about the importance of turnout next year, and a lot of that is about making sure younger people and people of color show up to vote. That’s exactly where Mayor Pete is weakest."

Ms. Sanders’s relationship with reporters reached a nadir in April after it was revealed that she had admitted under oath to investigators working for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, that her claim at a press briefing that “countless members of the F.B.I.” told her they had lost confidence in the bureau’s director, James B.

In Hot Springs, the crowd was hardly dwelling on the incident.

“The main thing I like about her is her honesty,” said Carla Shelton, a small-business owner who brought her daughter to hear Ms. Sanders speak. “She got a bad rap because people are offended that she does tell the truth. I’m 100 percent behind her.”

Ms. Sanders arrived at the dinner bearing a “Make America Great Again” cap signed by Vice President Mike Pence, which was auctioned off for $750. She warned of the “chaos” that would ensue if Democrats were allowed to “take guns out of our homes” and force “taxpayer-funded abortion on demand, anytime.”

The crowd swarmed her. Her husband, Brian Sanders, drove her home.

Very nice to meet you, Michael Barbaro. So, Senator Sanders, my colleague Alex Burns told me that to understand your political career, and your presidential campaign today, we have to go back to the first time that you won elected office as mayor of Burlington in 1981. So that’s —

bernie sanders

The New York Times got it right. Every once in a while.

michael barbaro

So that’s what I want to ask you about.

bernie sanders

All right, there you go.

michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

archived recording Burlington is the largest city in Vermont. Situated as it is on Lake Champlain with the Adirondack Mountains view, it’s a lovely, lovely spot. We’d like you to meet its new mayor. Mayor Sanders got a lot of attention recently, not only with his ten vote victory, but mostly because he is a socialist.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Ronald Reagan and his billionaire friends do not represent America, but we do. Lastly, I want to touch upon an issue that dear to my heart, and that is the issue of affordable health care. The people of Burlington voted overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly in support of Congress moving forward to establish a national health care system. I think that is exactly how this country is going to have to go on that issue.

michael barbaro

It’s Friday, December 6. Alex Burns, why this moment?

alex burns

Bernie Sanders is such an unusual character in American politics, as a lifelong socialist and left wing activist who has endured for decades as a major political figure, and who has become a leading presidential candidate. And to understand how he got from, really, the fringes of American politics to the absolute forefront, you have to go back to this moment in the early 1980s where he becomes mayor of Burlington, where he figures out how to take those ideas and actually win elections with them, and then govern. This is a period I’ve been spending a lot of time on in my own reporting because it’s just such a vital formative experience for Sanders. And so the story starts with the turn of the 1970s as Bernie Sanders arrives in Vermont with a whole lot of left wing ideas, not a whole lot of local connections, and links up with a new marginal political party called the Liberty Union.

bernie sanders

And that party had been formed around opposition to the war in Vietnam, and in the fight for economic justice. It’s a very small party in a very small state.

michael barbaro

Bernie Sanders starts showing up to Liberty Union meetings, and the party identifies him as the man they want to run for a U.S. Senate seat in 1971.

bernie sanders

And it was a very interesting campaign, and so forth, and so on. I got two percent of the vote.

michael barbaro

He loses that election, but then he has gotten the electoral bug.

bernie sanders

A year later, there was the general election. I ran for governor of the state, I got one percent.

michael barbaro

He loses again.

bernie sanders

Then I ran for Senate again against Pat Leahy, as Leahy often reminds me, and I got four percent.

michael barbaro

And again, he loses. I’m seeing a pattern here.

bernie sanders

Yes.

michael barbaro

It is loss, after loss, after loss. And while he’s running and losing, he has a series of odd jobs.

bernie sanders

I was doing some writing. I was banging nails, doing a little bit of carpentry work.

michael barbaro

He also had a job putting together newsreels and educational film strips about history for school kids.

bernie sanders

That’s before video. For younger people, there was a thing called film strips. I won’t go through what they were, photographs and sound. And I did most of the work myself, had a little bit of help, photography and so forth. It was lot of fun, actually.

michael barbaro

He sells these films to schools in the region, and he also spends time putting together a project that he’s personally quite invested in and proud of.

archived recording If you are the average American who watches television 40 hours a week, you have probably heard of such important people as Kojak and Wonder Woman. Strangely enough, however, nobody has told you about Eugene Debs, one of the most important Americans of the 20th century.

michael barbaro

Which is a film about the life of the legendary American socialist leader, Eugene Debs.

bernie sanders

Debs was a very great American. He was one of the original founders of industrial unionism, socialist party candidate for president six times, somebody I admired a whole lot.

archived recording (eugene debs) The ruling class has always taught and trained you to believe it to be your patriotic duty to go to war, and to have yourself slaughtered at their command. But in all the history of the world, you the people have never had a voice in declaring war.

michael barbaro

So throughout the 1970s, he is this activist educator who is running campaign after campaign, and losing every time. He’s not really developing a professional or political career for himself in Vermont. But in the city of Burlington —

bernie sanders

In 1980 or so, some friends of mine came up to me. And they said, you know, there’s going to be a mayor’s election coming up in ‘81. And you know what, we checked the records, and you did pretty well running as a Liberty Union candidate. You got actually 12 percent of the vote in some of the working class districts in Burlington.

michael barbaro

So two percent, or four percent, or six percent —

bernie sanders

That was statewide. But in Burlington, we did better.

michael barbaro

You were doing better.

bernie sanders

Yeah. So we got a bunch of people together, and they said, O.K., we’ll do it.

archived recording Bernie Sanders, a Brooklyn born self-described socialist running for mayor for the first time in 1981, running against a Democratic old guard that had run the city for a decade.

michael barbaro

When Sanders becomes a candidate for mayor, he is facing off against a powerful Democratic establishment. Burlington at this point, for decades has been essentially a one party town with a relatively conservative Democratic ruling clique that has just had a hammerlock on city politics. The incumbent mayor is not seen by anybody as vulnerable, to the point that the Republicans don’t even field a candidate against him. He’s also up against, just a culture of apathy when it comes to municipal elections. People generally don’t show up to vote for mayor, or for other city offices. So Bernie Sanders and this kind of ragtag group of academics and activists and intellectuals band together to try to figure out how to crack a city election in a place where nobody like them has ever won before.

bernie sanders

You would literally not believe if I told you how little we knew about politics. At the end of the day, I mean, real politics. It’s one thing to run for statewide office knowing you’re not going to win and get on our radio show and talk about issues, which I could do, but the nitty-gritty of politics.

michael barbaro

So as a newcomer to city politics, Bernie Sanders runs a different kind of campaign from the campaigns he’s run before. This isn’t about 30,000 foot ideological issues, like when he was a protest candidate for the Senate.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Ruth, you’re a volunteer worker at the old North end food co-op here in Burlington. archived recording Right. We’re on disability, social security. archived recording (bernie sanders) You got cut from $131 to — archived recording $48. archived recording (bernie sanders) And what was the justification for that? How do they expect you to live on the difference? archived recording They don’t care.

michael barbaro

This is a ground level campaign that’s waged over really concrete kitchen table issues that are relevant, he hopes, to a wide array of constituencies in the city that feel like they’ve been left out by the existing power structure.

bernie sanders

We had a lot of support in, for example, low income housing projects from people were getting a raw deal from the city that ran the projects. We had support from environmental groups. We had support from one group in the south end of the city. There was going to be a major highway going right through the neighborhood, and they said, we don’t like that.

michael barbaro

So Sanders is gaining some real support in this race. He’s not a trivial candidate, but still, the powers that be in Burlington do not see him as a threat to win this election. Let me talk about election night. What was the story of that night for you?

bernie sanders

Well, when I walked in on election day, I was of two opinions. Number one, that we would lose very heavily. And the newspapers, some guy, a newspaper writer was covering it, he said, the odds of Sanders winning are about 100 to one. That was literally what they wrote. So either we were doing something magical, or we would lose overwhelmingly. What I did not anticipate is that on election night, I think the results were, we were ahead by 14 votes. And after the recount, 10 votes. That, I did not expect.

archived recording Many people in Burlington are still in a state of shock following that city’s most stunning political upset in memory last night.

michael barbaro

The press reports from election night describe him as stunned, and then elated that he wins. And he wins by the absolute narrowest of margins, just ten votes.

alex burns

Ten votes.

archived recording Bernard Sanders, one of the founders of the Liberty Union Party, and a consistent loser in previous quests for elective office, was now the big winner. Considered by many to be unelectable because of his so-called radical views, Mr. Sanders put together an unlikely coalition of supporters and edged the ten year incumbent Gordon Paquette.

michael barbaro

So your strategy had worked. When you take office, how did becoming an elected official, the day to day reality of it, match your expectations of the power of winning this office and being mayor?

bernie sanders

Well, we had a very unique experience.

alex burns

Bernie Sanders has pulled off an extraordinary feat. He has upended the city establishment, he has become a socialist mayor in the United States at the height of the Cold War. But what happens next is he runs into a brick wall of political opposition. There is a body in Burlington, the Board of Aldermen. We would call it a city council. There are 13 members, 11 of them are either Democrats or Republicans, but their party label matters less than the fact that they are opposed to Bernie Sanders. He comes in, the powerful Democrats and the powerful Republicans both essentially say, he should not be the mayor of the city, and he will not be the mayor of the city for very long. Because we’re going to make sure that he can’t get anything done.

michael barbaro

People were trying to sabotage you?

bernie sanders

Trying to sabotage me, yes. They were trying to sabotage me. The first thing they did was to fire my secretary.

michael barbaro

They have the power to fire your secretary?

bernie sanders

Yeah, they did.

michael barbaro

So they reject his secretary. They take it back pretty quickly, but the damage to the relationship is kind of done. Not only do the board of Aldermen mess with his ability to hire a secretary, they reject all of his nominees for the top jobs in the city, city clerk, city treasurer, city attorney.

bernie sanders

And they made me run the city for the first year with exactly the administration of the guy I had beaten. You know, it’s like —

michael barbaro

You’re being neutered.

bernie sanders

Yes. So it’s like, you know, Donald Trump running his administration with Barack Obama’s appointees.

alex burns

So for really his first full year as mayor, he has a somewhat ornamental role.

michael barbaro

How are how are you thinking about this challenge?

bernie sanders

Well, their attitude, what they had said, and one of their leaders said, well, look. Bernie Sanders is a fluke. That was the word they used, and they said —

michael barbaro

Your brand of politics, everything about you, they thought was just a fluke.

bernie sanders

Right, this is an accident that should never have happened. And we will stonewall him in the first year, people will see that he can’t accomplish anything, then we’ll go back to the old ways.

michael barbaro

They’re going to drive you from office.

bernie sanders

Yeah. Well, it was a brutal year. So what we had to do was literally form a parallel city government without any money. I mean, we didn’t, couldn’t pay anybody, but we brought together a group of strong supporters and we had them helping us working on legislation and ideas. And we did everything that we could while we were being absolutely opposed by the Democratic and Republicans on the board of Aldermen. So we organized at the grass-roots level, we mobilize people. Our job was to get people involved in the political process.

michael barbaro

How did you do that?

bernie sanders

Well, I’ll tell you how we did it. Even before I took office, we had meetings on issues that people were concerned about that had been ignored for a very long time. We said, we believe in arts. You know, a city has got to be vital and alive. What do we do about the arts? What do we do about economic development? What do we do about women’s rights? So we ended up storming a council on Arts, a council on women, a council on youth. We started what we called neighborhood planning associations, which meant we gave local neighborhoods, each ward had a certain amount of money and they spent it however they wanted. So we tried to democratize it, and we brought people into the process. So it wasn’t me saying, we’re going to do A, B and C. These were people who themselves were now empowered.

michael barbaro

So you’re finding a way to essentially circumvent these aldermen who think you’re a fluke, and think they can block you by literally tapping into —

bernie sanders

Right.

michael barbaro

More voters, more people. When did you know that this strategy was actually working?

bernie sanders

Well, when hundreds of people would show up at city council meetings and demand our agenda. We were fighting for an agenda, it was being blocked by the city council. So people were upset about it, and here’s the interesting thing: We have elections for mayor then every two years, but half the board of Aldermen comes up on the odd year.

michael barbaro

So in 1982, one year after Sanders becomes mayor, seven of the 13 members of the board of aldermen are up for re-election.

bernie sanders

Essentially, there was a referendum on my administration.

michael barbaro

These elections became a chance for Mayor Sanders to go directly to the voters and ask them to replace these intransigent members of the board of aldermen with people who are friendly to him and supportive of his ideas.

bernie sanders

We ran candidates in almost every ward in the city. I probably have never worked so hard in my life. I knocked on almost every door in the city with the candidates that we were running with. And this is the winter time in Vermont, so we’re talking about 10 below zero, in zero weather. And on election night, the turnout was phenomenal for a non-mayor’s race, it was just off the charts. In five — if my memory is correct, in the five wards that we ran in, we won outright three of the wards, in all of the working class areas. And here is the most exciting thing about all of this. If you go back to the basement of City Hall and check the old records in Burlington, what you’ll find is that between 1979, that was the previous election before I won, and two years later when I was running for re-election we doubled voter turnout.

michael barbaro

He’s right, voter turnout really did rise in Burlington when Sanders got involved in city politics. And some of that is about him and his message and his political organization. Some of it is just having contested elections, elections where people file to run against the people who are already sitting in public office. When you have two choices rather than one, then yeah, more people show up to make a choice.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Good evening. We’re recording this on Friday, March 5th, and we’ve decided to get out of City Hall, get out of the office. And we’re here on the first floor the Burlington Square Mall.

michael barbaro

And he continues to engage and attempt to inspire voters in this same way, getting out in the community. He’s a highly visible mayor.

archived recording (bernie sanders) And I think what we’ll do is have some informal discussions with Vermonters as they walk past us, and as we can grab them. And we’ll see if we can get their views on some of the important issues of the day. But before we do —

michael barbaro

He creates a local television show called “Bernie Speaks With the Community,” where he is just out there and connected to your average voter.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Oops, oh, here we go. archived recording Hi, Shannon. archived recording (bernie sanders) Shannon, do you live in Burlington, Shannon? archived recording Yeah. archived recording (bernie sanders) O.K. So how are things going with you? archived recording Pretty good. I was just wondering, my mother had this idea for an indoor/outdoor amusement park by the waterfront, and she wanted — and I want to know if, is there anything going to be done about it? archived recording (bernie sanders) Well, I can’t say for sure that something will be done immediately. I think it is a good idea, and interestingly enough, your mother mentioned —

michael barbaro

It’s a highly unusual approach for a municipal politician, and especially in a city where the mayor had not been that kind of man about town previous.

archived recording (bernie sanders) O.K. The next person that we’ve kidnapped here off the streets for a few words is Jodie Baggerly. Jodie, welcome. archived recording (jodie baggerly) Well, thank you.

What Jodie is talking about is, the city negotiated with the Mountain Cable Company —

michael barbaro

So Senator Sanders, in brief, what are the lessons of this moment for you?

bernie sanders

Lessons of this moment is that winning politics is grass-roots politics, that winning politics is developing coalitions of working people, of low income people, of women, of environmentalists. So coalition is, we do it from the bottom on up, and we ended up in my years as mayor taking on everybody.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

[music]

michael barbaro

So Alex, in Sanders’s telling, in the face of total political opposition and stonewalling, his solution is to essentially do what got him political power in the first place, which is go to the people, talk to the people, always the people.

That’s his political brand as mayor, much as it’s his political brand now. And in Burlington, it’s an approach that really works for him. It establishes him as a legitimate city executive with an independent power base who cannot just be treated as an interloper in City Hall. It’s also the first of a couple stages in Mayor Sanders’ campaign to reinvent Burlington city politics. And if the first part of that is about really engaging with city politics at the ground level, the next stage after he’s been mayor for a couple of years, is to look way beyond Burlington and take on big national and international political issues, and connect them back to the local level.

archived recording If I were the president of the largest bank in Burlington, I’d be real nervous about you. archived recording (bernie sanders) Well, they may be, they may be. But I think — and they are. But I think what we’ve often talked about also, is that my powers as mayor are in many ways limited. And I have my visions as to what life should be in Vermont, in Burlington, and in the United States, but we are going to speak out, though, on national and international issues which affect the city of Burlington. For example, obviously, we’re very concerned about Mr. Reagan’s policies which are impacting devastatingly on low income and working people. But we know what our powers are within the city of Burlington.

michael barbaro

So Senator Sanders, during this period you start talking about national issues. You start talking about President Reagan, his economic policy. You start talking about foreign policy. You send letters to the leaders of Japan expressing regret for the two bombs that were dropped on that country by the U.S. What was your thinking? As you’re building this coalition locally, you start talking about issues beyond the borders of Burlington. And what is your thinking —

bernie sanders

Well, let’s be clear. 90 plus percent of our energy was dealing with local issues like reforming the police department and paving the streets. We brought a minor league baseball team into Burlington, Vermont. 95, 98 percent of our work was locally, doing what mayors are supposed to do. But as part of empowering people, what we also believed is it was important to think globally and act locally. So if we were spending a whole lot of money in Washington under Reagan, investing in military spending, or giving tax breaks to the rich, that impacted the city of Burlington. We are mayors, we need money to help us with housing. We need money to help us with roads and infrastructure, and yet Washington is spending this money on the military, or they’re busy invading another country, or whatever they’re doing. We should be speaking up on those issues.

archived recording (bernie sanders) The question is whether we use the incredible wealth and natural resources and intelligence of our society to create a decent standard of living, a decent life for all of our people in this country and abroad, or do we develop the greatest military machine for killing in the history of the world. That’s what the choice is.

bernie sanders

This was in the middle of the Cold War, and we started a sister-city program. I know the, some of the right wing media misinterprets this. But what we did is, I took a group of about a dozen people from Burlington to Yaroslavl in the old Soviet Union.

archived recording [SINGING]

bernie sanders

We had hockey teams coming out, we had doctors coming in and out, we had kids coming in and out. It really — I love the idea of sister-city programs, and it worked phenomenally well.

archived recording [SINGING] This land is your land, this land is my land —

bernie sanders

And it involved a lot of people. So the kids began to learn about Russia, and I happened to believe then, and I believe now, that if we’re going to bring peace to the world, we need a lot of cultural exchanges, we need a lot of youth exchanges. In fact, I recently proposed taking one-tenth of one percent of the military budget and putting it into cultural exchanges, which I think is a very good investment.

archived recording [SINGING] Your land, this land is my land. From California to the New York islands. From the red wood forests — archived recording (bernie sanders) I had an experience this last summer, I was invited by the government of Nicaragua to attend the sixth anniversary of their revolution. And they must have had four or 500,000 people out there listening to speeches, and the horrible thought that I had really sunk my stomach, was that kids in my own city, young kids, working class kids, might be asked by this president to go to Nicaragua to kill and get killed. And it was a horrible thought.

michael barbaro

Some of these endeavors were relatively bold. At a certain point, you go to Nicaragua. You end up meeting with the leader of the Sandinistas. And I — oh, no. I’m not worried about any —

bernie sanders

No, I’m just —

michael barbaro

Oh, you’re worried about time?

bernie sanders

Yeah, we’re running. Yes, we are running — how are we doing on time?

michael barbaro

Five more minutes?

bernie sanders

I think we’re probably going to have to end it right now.

michael barbaro

Oh. No, no, no. This is not a — don’t end it on this question if that’s the issue.

bernie sanders

Well, you know, the issue is —

michael barbaro

Trust me, this is not — all I was going to asking you was, how do events like that connect to voters in Burlington? In your mind —

bernie sanders

Good, absolutely. Very good question. Well, I’ll tell you why —

michael barbaro

How does meeting with an international leader like that —

bernie sanders

I’ll tell you why it does. Because I believe we have to empower people. One of the things we did is, we said to people, speak out on national and international issues. Yes, the mayor of the city of Burlington can’t determine the defense budget. But if we rally people all over the country speaking out on these issues, then the members of Congress and U.S. senators will hear that. So to answer your question, this is just another mechanism that we had to say to people, you have a voice. Do you think we should be spending more money on nuclear weapons? Vote on it. Talk about it. So all of this has to do with empowering people to understand that in a democracy, they can determine the future.

michael barbaro

Alex, what do you make of that?

alex burns

That is really the essence of the Bernie Sanders approach to politics, that the most important thing a political leader can do is give voice to people’s deepest concerns and frustrations, and encourage people to give voice to it themselves. And if there is a gap between what that political leader is expressing or channeling, and what he can actually accomplish, it’s almost irrelevant, that the act of expression and engagement is the most important thing. And what happens when you draw people in on an issue like climate change, or the Reagan administration’s policies in Central America, is they become politically activated in a way that then transforms politics closer to home at the local level.

michael barbaro

And Sanders did eventually articulate what you’re describing, but not before he got frustrated with me and seemed to indicate he might end the interview when I mentioned Nicaragua. What do you think that that’s about?

alex burns

Well first of all this is a really charged moment in his early career and in American politics. There has been a revolution in Nicaragua. Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas are a left wing revolutionary movement that overthrows a repressive regime. They are seen as dangerous by the Reagan administration because they are so left wing, and the Republicans in Washington prop up a brutal right wing militia to fight the Sandinistas. Bernie Sanders is one of many Americans on the left who get involved at that point in demonstrating in favor of the Sandinistas, or against Ronald Reagan. Except Sanders takes it considerably further when he actually goes to Nicaragua, shakes hands with Ortega himself. This is a story that someone in Sanders’s position probably ought to be able to explain. Or at least you would think he would feel comfortable explaining it. And what I find somewhat confounding as a reporter is how much he resents even the prompt to go into his thinking at the time and to reflect a little bit on some of the things about his support for the Sandinistas that may not look as justifiable in retrospect. He doesn’t want to do that. My sense is that, at the heart of it for him, is this sense that even asking the question is a kind of red baiting, that it reflects the way the political establishment — and he very much lumps the media in with the political establishment, is out to get him. Much as it was in Burlington, much as he believes it was in the 2016 campaign. This is a guy who in his early days as mayor was described by a fellow elected official as representing the fungus of socialism. He is somebody who is very, very sensitive to anything he perceives as the charge that he is not just a populist, not just very liberal, but this wildly outside the mainstream dangerous radical. And when you raise Nicaragua, I do think that’s the nerve that it hits.

michael barbaro

So that there’s no misunderstanding, those who listen and ask about Nicaragua, I want to give you a chance to make sure that there’s no confusion for any listener who’s casually checking in.

bernie sanders

All right —

michael barbaro

The question is, was there anything about Daniel Ortega that —

bernie sanders

Let me just say this.

michael barbaro

You knew at the time that gave you pause.

bernie sanders

Well, what gave me pause was that the United States at that time, as you may recall. I don’t know, do you remember —

michael barbaro

I was a student.

bernie sanders

Who the president was before Ortega? A dictator named Somoza who was a dictator, a very bad guy supported by the United States of America. Then Ortega came to power, the Sandinistas came to power, and the United States intended to do what it had done in many instances. You are aware the United States has a habit of overthrowing governments in Latin America.

michael barbaro

Yes.

bernie sanders

I didn’t think that was a good idea. Didn’t think it was a good idea then, and I didn’t think it was a good idea now. So we worked against American intervention. So we went there to say, as part of a national movement, that the United States should not be involved.

michael barbaro

Right.

bernie sanders

About overthrowing small governments.

michael barbaro

And for the record, in ‘85, were you aware of any human rights issues or abuses by Ortega?

bernie sanders

Well, we were aware that this was a very controversial moment, having taken over from a dictatorship. We were also aware that the United States at that time was supporting many governments in Latin America who were much more brutal than Ortega was.

alex burns

What you hear there is such an evasiveness about assessing the Ortega government on its own merits, that he really wants to talk about his advocacy around Nicaragua exclusively as a repudiation of Reagan, and not as an endorsement of what was going on there. And if you look at his comments and activities at the time, that’s not quite right. He was more explicitly supportive of what the Sandinistas were doing then just going there as a sort of anti-interventionist advocate. But in fairness to Sanders, this was not a fringe position at the time. Support for the Sandinistas has obviously not necessarily aged as well as Bernie Sanders might have expected it to politically, and that’s I think where you hear his real discomfort talking about it in the context of this campaign.

michael barbaro

But in taking this trip and talking about it the way he does, he is living his creed, essentially.

alex burns

Exactly. It is using all the levers of his power and public influence as an elected official to weigh in on this subject that is about as distant, literally, from Burlington as you can get.

[music]

michael barbaro

As this strategy is being deployed, you’re winning your fourth term as mayor. And you go on, successfully this time, to run for statewide office. The House, the Senate, and then, of course, you run for president 2016, now again in 2020. In each of these campaigns and each of these moments, you’re building larger and more powerful coalitions of voters. And given that history and your success in doing that, what do you think is the big lesson from this early phase? Why do you think it is that when we went to Alex Burns and asked him this question, and he said, you have to go back to ‘81, you have to go back to Burlington to understand Senator Sanders and this campaign and this moment. Why is he right, why do we have to go back to that race and that moment?

bernie sanders

Politics in America has been very much from the top on down. You still read articles in The New York Times where wealthy donors gathered today at a hotel to express concern about the Democratic candidates. Who cares about wealthy donors? We have over 1.1 million Americans who have made donations to our campaign. And they’re not wealthy, these are working class people. They’re teachers, they’re workers at Amazon, they’re workers at Walmart. What I believe then and what I believe now, the way you transform society is from the bottom on up. You talk about issues that are relevant to working people, issues that are relevant to low income people, issues that are relevant to young people, and you grow the voter base. So what I pointed out to you, maybe the most important thing that we did, is from 1979 to 1983, we doubled, doubled the number of people voting. And what we’re trying to do in this campaign right now —

michael barbaro

Is parallel.

bernie sanders

Is to significantly increase the voter turnout by talking to people who don’t vote. In Burlington, what happened is low income and working class people saw that government could work for them. And they said, oh my God, I never knew that. My kids now have a program, we have an after school program they didn’t have. We have a child care center we didn’t have. Our streets are getting paved, snow is getting moved. I didn’t know that — we’re going to go out, we’re going to support Bernie, and we’re going to support the candidates that he wants for Board of Aldermen. And now what we have to do in this country, which has one of the lowest voter turnout rates of any major country on earth, is to reach out to those working people, reach out to those young people. And when they start participating in the political process, that is the political revolution.

michael barbaro

If you become president, the question will be, sure, you talked about national and international issues when you were mayor, but there was no real expectation that you could change the course of events as a single mayor of a town in Burlington. If you become president, that expectation will be real and urgent and present. So are we to understand that if you run into political obstacles as president, that your strategy will be to call upon the expanded electorate that you have created and turned that into a political force that you would then, all of what you did in Burlington with the Board of Aldermen?

bernie sanders

Yes. Well, it’s not an if. That is exactly what is going to happen. When we talk about the need to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to every person through a Medicare for all, single-payer program, the only way that’s going to happen is when millions of people stand up and take on the insurance companies and the drug companies. When we talk about transforming our energy system to save the planet from the devastation, absolute devastation of the global crisis regarding climate change, the only way that happens is when millions of people stand up to take on the fossil fuel industry. So on all of the issues we are talking about, that’s what the political revolution is about. It’s saying that we’re going to mobilize millions of people to stand up for an agenda that works for working families. And when they do that, there will be no stopping them. We will be able to create a government and an economy that works for all, not just the one percent.

michael barbaro

Alex, what do you think of that theory?

alex burns

Well, the coalition that he’s trying to build as a presidential candidate is such an echo of what he accomplished in Burlington. And his theory is, they are going to show up for him in a way they wouldn’t show up for any other candidate because he is speaking to their concerns directly. And Sanders has plenty of reason to expect that might really be the case. He has charted this remarkable ascent as a national political figure on the strength of this coalition and mainstreamed a set of socialist and quasi-socialist ideas that were seen as really outside the mainstream when he started campaigning on them decades ago, into the center of one of the country’s two major political parties. The question for someone like Bernie Sanders is, does that theory work in a general election on a national scale? Can you really bring in that many new people into the political process where there already are a whole lot of people who vote, and who have pretty vested interests in the context of an American election? Can you speak in the way he does to the concerns of working class people without alienating millions of people who already vote for the Democratic Party, and don’t necessarily share that world view? And could you, as the president, use that exact same playbook, that exact same coalition to master Washington and break a Republican Senate in the same way that he transformed Burlington and broke a city council?

Re “Bloomberg Hits Democratic Presidential Race Running to the Center” (news article, Nov. 25):

I believe that Michael Bloomberg may appeal to potential crossover Republicans. As a lifelong Republican I find that our current president represents very few of my long-held beliefs. There are many Republicans around the country with the same view. Whether it is immigration, climate change or income inequality, we want solutions that are fair and humane. The current president will not provide this.

On the Democratic side, plans presented by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are much too far to the left for voters like me to support. Mr. Bloomberg, a former Republican, will hopefully present a middle ground that both Republicans and Democrats can support."

Gail: And tell his wife: “Mother, it’s time to go bye-bye.”

Bret: As for Haley, she does everything Pence does in terms of her appeal to the Trump base, including with evangelical voters, and probably widens Trump’s appeal somewhat, for instance with Republican-leaning suburban women. And her new book goes out of its way to showcase how loyal she was to Trump, as opposed to people like the former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the former chief of staff John Kelly. That’s purposely designed to ingratiate herself with the Trump voters who weren’t entirely sure she was onboard the MAGA Express.

Gail: And, of course, to ingratiate herself with the president. Who I’m sure didn’t read the book, but probably got a one-paragraph summary.

Bret: Whatever Trump decides — and whatever she decides — she’s clearly setting herself up for a presidential run in 2024. She’ll be formidable. The shame is that, after being an early Trump critic, she clearly feels she can win the nomination only by drawing closer to the president, not distancing herself. It just shows how thoroughly Trump has captured and corrupted the party.

Meanwhile, Democrats! I thought that last debate was a bit of a snoozefest. The big story, it seems to me, is that Pete Buttigieg is approaching front-runner status, at least when it comes to Iowa. I’m more of a fan than you are. Can he go the distance?

Gail: Don’t think so. And it’s not a good idea. We just talked about the importance of turnout next year, and a lot of that is about making sure younger people and people of color show up to vote. That’s exactly where Mayor Pete is weakest."

archived recording (bernie sanders) Ronald Reagan and his billionaire friends do not represent America, but we do. Lastly, I want to touch upon an issue that dear to my heart, and that is the issue of affordable health care. The people of Burlington voted overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly in support of Congress moving forward to establish a national health care system. I think that is exactly how this country is going to have to go on that issue.

michael barbaro

It’s Friday, December 6. Alex Burns, why this moment?

alex burns

Bernie Sanders is such an unusual character in American politics, as a lifelong socialist and left wing activist who has endured for decades as a major political figure, and who has become a leading presidential candidate. And to understand how he got from, really, the fringes of American politics to the absolute forefront, you have to go back to this moment in the early 1980s where he becomes mayor of Burlington, where he figures out how to take those ideas and actually win elections with them, and then govern. This is a period I’ve been spending a lot of time on in my own reporting because it’s just such a vital formative experience for Sanders. And so the story starts with the turn of the 1970s as Bernie Sanders arrives in Vermont with a whole lot of left wing ideas, not a whole lot of local connections, and links up with a new marginal political party called the Liberty Union.

bernie sanders

And that party had been formed around opposition to the war in Vietnam, and in the fight for economic justice. It’s a very small party in a very small state.

michael barbaro

Bernie Sanders starts showing up to Liberty Union meetings, and the party identifies him as the man they want to run for a U.S. Senate seat in 1971.

bernie sanders

And it was a very interesting campaign, and so forth, and so on. I got two percent of the vote.

michael barbaro

He loses that election, but then he has gotten the electoral bug.

bernie sanders

A year later, there was the general election. I ran for governor of the state, I got one percent.

michael barbaro

He loses again.

bernie sanders

Then I ran for Senate again against Pat Leahy, as Leahy often reminds me, and I got four percent.

michael barbaro

And again, he loses. I’m seeing a pattern here.

bernie sanders

Yes.

michael barbaro

It is loss, after loss, after loss. And while he’s running and losing, he has a series of odd jobs.

bernie sanders

I was doing some writing. I was banging nails, doing a little bit of carpentry work.

michael barbaro

He also had a job putting together newsreels and educational film strips about history for school kids.

bernie sanders

That’s before video. For younger people, there was a thing called film strips. I won’t go through what they were, photographs and sound. And I did most of the work myself, had a little bit of help, photography and so forth. It was lot of fun, actually.

michael barbaro

He sells these films to schools in the region, and he also spends time putting together a project that he’s personally quite invested in and proud of.

archived recording If you are the average American who watches television 40 hours a week, you have probably heard of such important people as Kojak and Wonder Woman. Strangely enough, however, nobody has told you about Eugene Debs, one of the most important Americans of the 20th century.

michael barbaro

Which is a film about the life of the legendary American socialist leader, Eugene Debs.

bernie sanders

Debs was a very great American. He was one of the original founders of industrial unionism, socialist party candidate for president six times, somebody I admired a whole lot.

archived recording (eugene debs) The ruling class has always taught and trained you to believe it to be your patriotic duty to go to war, and to have yourself slaughtered at their command. But in all the history of the world, you the people have never had a voice in declaring war.

michael barbaro

So throughout the 1970s, he is this activist educator who is running campaign after campaign, and losing every time. He’s not really developing a professional or political career for himself in Vermont. But in the city of Burlington —

bernie sanders

In 1980 or so, some friends of mine came up to me. And they said, you know, there’s going to be a mayor’s election coming up in ‘81. And you know what, we checked the records, and you did pretty well running as a Liberty Union candidate. You got actually 12 percent of the vote in some of the working class districts in Burlington.

michael barbaro

So two percent, or four percent, or six percent —

bernie sanders

That was statewide. But in Burlington, we did better.

michael barbaro

You were doing better.

bernie sanders

Yeah. So we got a bunch of people together, and they said, O.K., we’ll do it.

archived recording Bernie Sanders, a Brooklyn born self-described socialist running for mayor for the first time in 1981, running against a Democratic old guard that had run the city for a decade.

michael barbaro

When Sanders becomes a candidate for mayor, he is facing off against a powerful Democratic establishment. Burlington at this point, for decades has been essentially a one party town with a relatively conservative Democratic ruling clique that has just had a hammerlock on city politics. The incumbent mayor is not seen by anybody as vulnerable, to the point that the Republicans don’t even field a candidate against him. He’s also up against, just a culture of apathy when it comes to municipal elections. People generally don’t show up to vote for mayor, or for other city offices. So Bernie Sanders and this kind of ragtag group of academics and activists and intellectuals band together to try to figure out how to crack a city election in a place where nobody like them has ever won before.

bernie sanders

You would literally not believe if I told you how little we knew about politics. At the end of the day, I mean, real politics. It’s one thing to run for statewide office knowing you’re not going to win and get on our radio show and talk about issues, which I could do, but the nitty-gritty of politics.

michael barbaro

So as a newcomer to city politics, Bernie Sanders runs a different kind of campaign from the campaigns he’s run before. This isn’t about 30,000 foot ideological issues, like when he was a protest candidate for the Senate.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Ruth, you’re a volunteer worker at the old North end food co-op here in Burlington. archived recording Right. We’re on disability, social security. archived recording (bernie sanders) You got cut from $131 to — archived recording $48. archived recording (bernie sanders) And what was the justification for that? How do they expect you to live on the difference? archived recording They don’t care.

michael barbaro

This is a ground level campaign that’s waged over really concrete kitchen table issues that are relevant, he hopes, to a wide array of constituencies in the city that feel like they’ve been left out by the existing power structure.

bernie sanders

We had a lot of support in, for example, low income housing projects from people were getting a raw deal from the city that ran the projects. We had support from environmental groups. We had support from one group in the south end of the city. There was going to be a major highway going right through the neighborhood, and they said, we don’t like that.

michael barbaro

So Sanders is gaining some real support in this race. He’s not a trivial candidate, but still, the powers that be in Burlington do not see him as a threat to win this election. Let me talk about election night. What was the story of that night for you?

bernie sanders

Well, when I walked in on election day, I was of two opinions. Number one, that we would lose very heavily. And the newspapers, some guy, a newspaper writer was covering it, he said, the odds of Sanders winning are about 100 to one. That was literally what they wrote. So either we were doing something magical, or we would lose overwhelmingly. What I did not anticipate is that on election night, I think the results were, we were ahead by 14 votes. And after the recount, 10 votes. That, I did not expect.

archived recording Many people in Burlington are still in a state of shock following that city’s most stunning political upset in memory last night.

michael barbaro

The press reports from election night describe him as stunned, and then elated that he wins. And he wins by the absolute narrowest of margins, just ten votes.

alex burns

Ten votes.

archived recording Bernard Sanders, one of the founders of the Liberty Union Party, and a consistent loser in previous quests for elective office, was now the big winner. Considered by many to be unelectable because of his so-called radical views, Mr. Sanders put together an unlikely coalition of supporters and edged the ten year incumbent Gordon Paquette.

michael barbaro

So your strategy had worked. When you take office, how did becoming an elected official, the day to day reality of it, match your expectations of the power of winning this office and being mayor?

bernie sanders

Well, we had a very unique experience.

alex burns

Bernie Sanders has pulled off an extraordinary feat. He has upended the city establishment, he has become a socialist mayor in the United States at the height of the Cold War. But what happens next is he runs into a brick wall of political opposition. There is a body in Burlington, the Board of Aldermen. We would call it a city council. There are 13 members, 11 of them are either Democrats or Republicans, but their party label matters less than the fact that they are opposed to Bernie Sanders. He comes in, the powerful Democrats and the powerful Republicans both essentially say, he should not be the mayor of the city, and he will not be the mayor of the city for very long. Because we’re going to make sure that he can’t get anything done.

michael barbaro

People were trying to sabotage you?

bernie sanders

Trying to sabotage me, yes. They were trying to sabotage me. The first thing they did was to fire my secretary.

michael barbaro

They have the power to fire your secretary?

bernie sanders

Yeah, they did.

michael barbaro

So they reject his secretary. They take it back pretty quickly, but the damage to the relationship is kind of done. Not only do the board of Aldermen mess with his ability to hire a secretary, they reject all of his nominees for the top jobs in the city, city clerk, city treasurer, city attorney.

bernie sanders

And they made me run the city for the first year with exactly the administration of the guy I had beaten. You know, it’s like —

michael barbaro

You’re being neutered.

bernie sanders

Yes. So it’s like, you know, Donald Trump running his administration with Barack Obama’s appointees.

alex burns

So for really his first full year as mayor, he has a somewhat ornamental role.

michael barbaro

How are how are you thinking about this challenge?

bernie sanders

Well, their attitude, what they had said, and one of their leaders said, well, look. Bernie Sanders is a fluke. That was the word they used, and they said —

michael barbaro

Your brand of politics, everything about you, they thought was just a fluke.

bernie sanders

Right, this is an accident that should never have happened. And we will stonewall him in the first year, people will see that he can’t accomplish anything, then we’ll go back to the old ways.

michael barbaro

They’re going to drive you from office.

bernie sanders

Yeah. Well, it was a brutal year. So what we had to do was literally form a parallel city government without any money. I mean, we didn’t, couldn’t pay anybody, but we brought together a group of strong supporters and we had them helping us working on legislation and ideas. And we did everything that we could while we were being absolutely opposed by the Democratic and Republicans on the board of Aldermen. So we organized at the grass-roots level, we mobilize people. Our job was to get people involved in the political process.

michael barbaro

How did you do that?

bernie sanders

Well, I’ll tell you how we did it. Even before I took office, we had meetings on issues that people were concerned about that had been ignored for a very long time. We said, we believe in arts. You know, a city has got to be vital and alive. What do we do about the arts? What do we do about economic development? What do we do about women’s rights? So we ended up storming a council on Arts, a council on women, a council on youth. We started what we called neighborhood planning associations, which meant we gave local neighborhoods, each ward had a certain amount of money and they spent it however they wanted. So we tried to democratize it, and we brought people into the process. So it wasn’t me saying, we’re going to do A, B and C. These were people who themselves were now empowered.

michael barbaro

So you’re finding a way to essentially circumvent these aldermen who think you’re a fluke, and think they can block you by literally tapping into —

bernie sanders

Right.

michael barbaro

More voters, more people. When did you know that this strategy was actually working?

bernie sanders

Well, when hundreds of people would show up at city council meetings and demand our agenda. We were fighting for an agenda, it was being blocked by the city council. So people were upset about it, and here’s the interesting thing: We have elections for mayor then every two years, but half the board of Aldermen comes up on the odd year.

michael barbaro

So in 1982, one year after Sanders becomes mayor, seven of the 13 members of the board of aldermen are up for re-election.

bernie sanders

Essentially, there was a referendum on my administration.

michael barbaro

These elections became a chance for Mayor Sanders to go directly to the voters and ask them to replace these intransigent members of the board of aldermen with people who are friendly to him and supportive of his ideas.

bernie sanders

We ran candidates in almost every ward in the city. I probably have never worked so hard in my life. I knocked on almost every door in the city with the candidates that we were running with. And this is the winter time in Vermont, so we’re talking about 10 below zero, in zero weather. And on election night, the turnout was phenomenal for a non-mayor’s race, it was just off the charts. In five — if my memory is correct, in the five wards that we ran in, we won outright three of the wards, in all of the working class areas. And here is the most exciting thing about all of this. If you go back to the basement of City Hall and check the old records in Burlington, what you’ll find is that between 1979, that was the previous election before I won, and two years later when I was running for re-election we doubled voter turnout.

michael barbaro

He’s right, voter turnout really did rise in Burlington when Sanders got involved in city politics. And some of that is about him and his message and his political organization. Some of it is just having contested elections, elections where people file to run against the people who are already sitting in public office. When you have two choices rather than one, then yeah, more people show up to make a choice.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Good evening. We’re recording this on Friday, March 5th, and we’ve decided to get out of City Hall, get out of the office. And we’re here on the first floor the Burlington Square Mall.

michael barbaro

And he continues to engage and attempt to inspire voters in this same way, getting out in the community. He’s a highly visible mayor.

archived recording (bernie sanders) And I think what we’ll do is have some informal discussions with Vermonters as they walk past us, and as we can grab them. And we’ll see if we can get their views on some of the important issues of the day. But before we do —

michael barbaro

He creates a local television show called “Bernie Speaks With the Community,” where he is just out there and connected to your average voter.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Oops, oh, here we go. archived recording Hi, Shannon. archived recording (bernie sanders) Shannon, do you live in Burlington, Shannon? archived recording Yeah. archived recording (bernie sanders) O.K. So how are things going with you? archived recording Pretty good. I was just wondering, my mother had this idea for an indoor/outdoor amusement park by the waterfront, and she wanted — and I want to know if, is there anything going to be done about it? archived recording (bernie sanders) Well, I can’t say for sure that something will be done immediately. I think it is a good idea, and interestingly enough, your mother mentioned —

michael barbaro

It’s a highly unusual approach for a municipal politician, and especially in a city where the mayor had not been that kind of man about town previous.

archived recording (bernie sanders) O.K. The next person that we’ve kidnapped here off the streets for a few words is Jodie Baggerly. Jodie, welcome. archived recording (jodie baggerly) Well, thank you. One thing I want to appreciate, being a disabled person, is the little discount we get on our cable TVs, because I think it’s a positive point to have educational programs to be able to watch and fill our minds at periods when we are unable to get out. archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me just jump in and remind our viewers. What Jodie is talking about is, the city negotiated with the Mountain Cable Company —

michael barbaro

So Senator Sanders, in brief, what are the lessons of this moment for you?

bernie sanders

Lessons of this moment is that winning politics is grass-roots politics, that winning politics is developing coalitions of working people, of low income people, of women, of environmentalists. So coalition is, we do it from the bottom on up, and we ended up in my years as mayor taking on everybody.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

[music]

michael barbaro

So Alex, in Sanders’s telling, in the face of total political opposition and stonewalling, his solution is to essentially do what got him political power in the first place, which is go to the people, talk to the people, always the people.

alex burns

That’s his political brand as mayor, much as it’s his political brand now. And in Burlington, it’s an approach that really works for him. It establishes him as a legitimate city executive with an independent power base who cannot just be treated as an interloper in City Hall. It’s also the first of a couple stages in Mayor Sanders’ campaign to reinvent Burlington city politics. And if the first part of that is about really engaging with city politics at the ground level, the next stage after he’s been mayor for a couple of years, is to look way beyond Burlington and take on big national and international political issues, and connect them back to the local level.

archived recording If I were the president of the largest bank in Burlington, I’d be real nervous about you. archived recording (bernie sanders) Well, they may be, they may be. But I think — and they are. But I think what we’ve often talked about also, is that my powers as mayor are in many ways limited. And I have my visions as to what life should be in Vermont, in Burlington, and in the United States, but we are going to speak out, though, on national and international issues which affect the city of Burlington. For example, obviously, we’re very concerned about Mr. Reagan’s policies which are impacting devastatingly on low income and working people. But we know what our powers are within the city of Burlington.

michael barbaro

So Senator Sanders, during this period you start talking about national issues. You start talking about President Reagan, his economic policy. You start talking about foreign policy. You send letters to the leaders of Japan expressing regret for the two bombs that were dropped on that country by the U.S. What was your thinking? As you’re building this coalition locally, you start talking about issues beyond the borders of Burlington. And what is your thinking —

bernie sanders

Well, let’s be clear. 90 plus percent of our energy was dealing with local issues like reforming the police department and paving the streets. We brought a minor league baseball team into Burlington, Vermont. 95, 98 percent of our work was locally, doing what mayors are supposed to do. But as part of empowering people, what we also believed is it was important to think globally and act locally. So if we were spending a whole lot of money in Washington under Reagan, investing in military spending, or giving tax breaks to the rich, that impacted the city of Burlington. We are mayors, we need money to help us with housing. We need money to help us with roads and infrastructure, and yet Washington is spending this money on the military, or they’re busy invading another country, or whatever they’re doing. We should be speaking up on those issues.

archived recording (bernie sanders) The question is whether we use the incredible wealth and natural resources and intelligence of our society to create a decent standard of living, a decent life for all of our people in this country and abroad, or do we develop the greatest military machine for killing in the history of the world. That’s what the choice is.

bernie sanders

This was in the middle of the Cold War, and we started a sister-city program. I know the, some of the right wing media misinterprets this. But what we did is, I took a group of about a dozen people from Burlington to Yaroslavl in the old Soviet Union.

archived recording [SINGING]

bernie sanders

We had hockey teams coming out, we had doctors coming in and out, we had kids coming in and out. It really — I love the idea of sister-city programs, and it worked phenomenally well.

archived recording [SINGING] This land is your land, this land is my land —

bernie sanders

And it involved a lot of people. So the kids began to learn about Russia, and I happened to believe then, and I believe now, that if we’re going to bring peace to the world, we need a lot of cultural exchanges, we need a lot of youth exchanges. In fact, I recently proposed taking one-tenth of one percent of the military budget and putting it into cultural exchanges, which I think is a very good investment.

archived recording [SINGING] Your land, this land is my land. From California to the New York islands. From the red wood forests — archived recording (bernie sanders) I had an experience this last summer, I was invited by the government of Nicaragua to attend the sixth anniversary of their revolution. And they must have had four or 500,000 people out there listening to speeches, and the horrible thought that I had really sunk my stomach, was that kids in my own city, young kids, working class kids, might be asked by this president to go to Nicaragua to kill and get killed. And it was a horrible thought.

michael barbaro

Some of these endeavors were relatively bold. At a certain point, you go to Nicaragua. You end up meeting with the leader of the Sandinistas. And I — oh, no. I’m not worried about any —

bernie sanders

No, I’m just —

michael barbaro

Oh, you’re worried about time?

bernie sanders

Yeah, we’re running. Yes, we are running — how are we doing on time?

michael barbaro

Five more minutes?

bernie sanders

I think we’re probably going to have to end it right now.

michael barbaro

Oh. No, no, no. This is not a — don’t end it on this question if that’s the issue.

bernie sanders

Well, you know, the issue is —

michael barbaro

Trust me, this is not — all I was going to asking you was, how do events like that connect to voters in Burlington? In your mind —

bernie sanders

Good, absolutely. Very good question. Well, I’ll tell you why —

michael barbaro

How does meeting with an international leader like that —

bernie sanders

I’ll tell you why it does. Because I believe we have to empower people. One of the things we did is, we said to people, speak out on national and international issues. Yes, the mayor of the city of Burlington can’t determine the defense budget. But if we rally people all over the country speaking out on these issues, then the members of Congress and U.S. senators will hear that. So to answer your question, this is just another mechanism that we had to say to people, you have a voice. Do you think we should be spending more money on nuclear weapons? Vote on it. Talk about it. So all of this has to do with empowering people to understand that in a democracy, they can determine the future.

michael barbaro

Alex, what do you make of that?

alex burns

That is really the essence of the Bernie Sanders approach to politics, that the most important thing a political leader can do is give voice to people’s deepest concerns and frustrations, and encourage people to give voice to it themselves. And if there is a gap between what that political leader is expressing or channeling, and what he can actually accomplish, it’s almost irrelevant, that the act of expression and engagement is the most important thing. And what happens when you draw people in on an issue like climate change, or the Reagan administration’s policies in Central America, is they become politically activated in a way that then transforms politics closer to home at the local level.

michael barbaro

And Sanders did eventually articulate what you’re describing, but not before he got frustrated with me and seemed to indicate he might end the interview when I mentioned Nicaragua. What do you think that that’s about?

alex burns

Well first of all this is a really charged moment in his early career and in American politics. There has been a revolution in Nicaragua. Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas are a left wing revolutionary movement that overthrows a repressive regime. They are seen as dangerous by the Reagan administration because they are so left wing, and the Republicans in Washington prop up a brutal right wing militia to fight the Sandinistas. Bernie Sanders is one of many Americans on the left who get involved at that point in demonstrating in favor of the Sandinistas, or against Ronald Reagan. Except Sanders takes it considerably further when he actually goes to Nicaragua, shakes hands with Ortega himself. This is a story that someone in Sanders’s position probably ought to be able to explain. Or at least you would think he would feel comfortable explaining it. And what I find somewhat confounding as a reporter is how much he resents even the prompt to go into his thinking at the time and to reflect a little bit on some of the things about his support for the Sandinistas that may not look as justifiable in retrospect. He doesn’t want to do that. My sense is that, at the heart of it for him, is this sense that even asking the question is a kind of red baiting, that it reflects the way the political establishment — and he very much lumps the media in with the political establishment, is out to get him. Much as it was in Burlington, much as he believes it was in the 2016 campaign. This is a guy who in his early days as mayor was described by a fellow elected official as representing the fungus of socialism. He is somebody who is very, very sensitive to anything he perceives as the charge that he is not just a populist, not just very liberal, but this wildly outside the mainstream dangerous radical. And when you raise Nicaragua, I do think that’s the nerve that it hits.

michael barbaro

So that there’s no misunderstanding, those who listen and ask about Nicaragua, I want to give you a chance to make sure that there’s no confusion for any listener who’s casually checking in.

bernie sanders

All right —

michael barbaro

The question is, was there anything about Daniel Ortega that —

bernie sanders

Let me just say this.

michael barbaro

You knew at the time that gave you pause.

bernie sanders

Well, what gave me pause was that the United States at that time, as you may recall. I don’t know, do you remember —

michael barbaro

I was a student.

bernie sanders

Who the president was before Ortega? A dictator named Somoza who was a dictator, a very bad guy supported by the United States of America. Then Ortega came to power, the Sandinistas came to power, and the United States intended to do what it had done in many instances. You are aware the United States has a habit of overthrowing governments in Latin America.

michael barbaro

Yes.

bernie sanders

I didn’t think that was a good idea. Didn’t think it was a good idea then, and I didn’t think it was a good idea now. So we worked against American intervention. So we went there to say, as part of a national movement, that the United States should not be involved.

michael barbaro

Right.

bernie sanders

About overthrowing small governments.

michael barbaro

And for the record, in ‘85, were you aware of any human rights issues or abuses by Ortega?

bernie sanders

Well, we were aware that this was a very controversial moment, having taken over from a dictatorship. We were also aware that the United States at that time was supporting many governments in Latin America who were much more brutal than Ortega was.

alex burns

What you hear there is such an evasiveness about assessing the Ortega government on its own merits, that he really wants to talk about his advocacy around Nicaragua exclusively as a repudiation of Reagan, and not as an endorsement of what was going on there. And if you look at his comments and activities at the time, that’s not quite right. He was more explicitly supportive of what the Sandinistas were doing then just going there as a sort of anti-interventionist advocate. But in fairness to Sanders, this was not a fringe position at the time. Support for the Sandinistas has obviously not necessarily aged as well as Bernie Sanders might have expected it to politically, and that’s I think where you hear his real discomfort talking about it in the context of this campaign.

michael barbaro

But in taking this trip and talking about it the way he does, he is living his creed, essentially.

alex burns

Exactly. It is using all the levers of his power and public influence as an elected official to weigh in on this subject that is about as distant, literally, from Burlington as you can get.

[music]

michael barbaro

As this strategy is being deployed, you’re winning your fourth term as mayor. And you go on, successfully this time, to run for statewide office. The House, the Senate, and then, of course, you run for president 2016, now again in 2020. In each of these campaigns and each of these moments, you’re building larger and more powerful coalitions of voters. And given that history and your success in doing that, what do you think is the big lesson from this early phase? Why do you think it is that when we went to Alex Burns and asked him this question, and he said, you have to go back to ‘81, you have to go back to Burlington to understand Senator Sanders and this campaign and this moment. Why is he right, why do we have to go back to that race and that moment?

bernie sanders

Politics in America has been very much from the top on down. You still read articles in The New York Times where wealthy donors gathered today at a hotel to express concern about the Democratic candidates. Who cares about wealthy donors? We have over 1.1 million Americans who have made donations to our campaign. And they’re not wealthy, these are working class people. They’re teachers, they’re workers at Amazon, they’re workers at Walmart. What I believe then and what I believe now, the way you transform society is from the bottom on up. You talk about issues that are relevant to working people, issues that are relevant to low income people, issues that are relevant to young people, and you grow the voter base. So what I pointed out to you, maybe the most important thing that we did, is from 1979 to 1983, we doubled, doubled the number of people voting. And what we’re trying to do in this campaign right now —

Is to significantly increase the voter turnout by talking to people who don’t vote. In Burlington, what happened is low income and working class people saw that government could work for them. And they said, oh my God, I never knew that. My kids now have a program, we have an after school program they didn’t have. We have a child care center we didn’t have. Our streets are getting paved, snow is getting moved. I didn’t know that — we’re going to go out, we’re going to support Bernie, and we’re going to support the candidates that he wants for Board of Aldermen. And now what we have to do in this country, which has one of the lowest voter turnout rates of any major country on earth, is to reach out to those working people, reach out to those young people. And when they start participating in the political process, that is the political revolution.

If you become president, the question will be, sure, you talked about national and international issues when you were mayor, but there was no real expectation that you could change the course of events as a single mayor of a town in Burlington. If you become president, that expectation will be real and urgent and present. So are we to understand that if you run into political obstacles as president, that your strategy will be to call upon the expanded electorate that you have created and turned that into a political force that you would then, all of what you did in Burlington with the Board of Aldermen?

bernie sanders

Yes. Well, it’s not an if. That is exactly what is going to happen. When we talk about the need to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to every person through a Medicare for all, single-payer program, the only way that’s going to happen is when millions of people stand up and take on the insurance companies and the drug companies. When we talk about transforming our energy system to save the planet from the devastation, absolute devastation of the global crisis regarding climate change, the only way that happens is when millions of people stand up to take on the fossil fuel industry. So on all of the issues we are talking about, that’s what the political revolution is about. It’s saying that we’re going to mobilize millions of people to stand up for an agenda that works for working families. And when they do that, there will be no stopping them. We will be able to create a government and an economy that works for all, not just the one percent.

Alex, what do you think of that theory?

alex burns

Well, the coalition that he’s trying to build as a presidential candidate is such an echo of what he accomplished in Burlington. And his theory is, they are going to show up for him in a way they wouldn’t show up for any other candidate because he is speaking to their concerns directly. And Sanders has plenty of reason to expect that might really be the case. He has charted this remarkable ascent as a national political figure on the strength of this coalition and mainstreamed a set of socialist and quasi-socialist ideas that were seen as really outside the mainstream when he started campaigning on them decades ago, into the center of one of the country’s two major political parties. The question for someone like Bernie Sanders is, does that theory work in a general election on a national scale? Can you really bring in that many new people into the political process where there already are a whole lot of people who vote, and who have pretty vested interests in the context of an American election? Can you speak in the way he does to the concerns of working class people without alienating millions of people who already vote for the Democratic Party, and don’t necessarily share that world view? And could you, as the president, use that exact same playbook, that exact same coalition to master Washington and break a Republican Senate in the same way that he transformed Burlington and broke a city council?

The proposal from Ms. Warren, a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, follows a House bill on the same subject that was introduced in June by Representative Denny Heck of Washington. It has yet to receive a vote.

“The horrifying acts of violence against hundreds of Lakota men, women and children at Wounded Knee should be condemned, not celebrated with Medals of Honor,” Ms. Warren said in a statement released Wednesday by her Senate office. “The Remove the Stain Act acknowledges a profoundly shameful event in U.S. history, and that’s why I’m joining my House colleagues in this effort to advance justice and take a step toward righting wrongs against Native peoples.”

Congress has rescinded more than 900 Medals of Honor since enacting legislation in 1916 to create a board of retired military officers to review previously awarded medals, according to Ms. Warren’s Senate office."

Ms. Warren’s tax is overwhelmingly popular ( 86 percent support ) with Democratic voters who have graduate degrees. Among voters with a high school diploma or less, the policy is still popular, but meaningfully less so, drawing 75 percent support.

Accordingly, less-educated voters are also less likely to say they favor Ms. Warren on the economy. That fits with other polling that has found the Massachusetts senator struggling to win over voters without a college degree.

Strikingly for a candidate who has put so much emphasis on the economy, Ms. Warren is viewed with caution by voters who care the most about the economy, and by those who are most worried about it. Among Democrats who say they are “very concerned” about losing their job, for example, 15 percent say they would trust Ms. Warren most on the economy out of all the Democratic candidates, compared with 23 percent of other Democratic voters.

Those struggles for Ms. Warren may partly reflect another important divide in the Democratic electorate: race. Black and Hispanic voters tend to rate the economy more highly as an issue than their white counterparts. They are also less likely to trust Ms. Warren on the economy.

Black and Hispanic voters are more likely to choose former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as the candidate they would trust on the economy. So are voters who say they are concerned about their jobs or their economic prospects. But voters’ preferences don’t fall neatly along ideological lines: Those same groups also tend to give high ratings to Mr. Sanders, who is closer to Ms. Warren than to Mr. Biden on most policy matters."
131,Ross Douthat,"Now, I have stacked the argument slightly, and left out a crucial axis of division where Sanders does worse than you expect: He struggles badly with his fellow Social Security recipients, the over-65.

It could be the Vermont Socialist.,2019-11-30,The New York Times,The Case for Bernie,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/30/opinion/sunday/bernie-sanders.html,"Now, I have stacked the argument slightly, and left out a crucial axis of division where Sanders does worse than you expect: He struggles badly with his fellow Social Security recipients, the over-65. This weakness and Biden’s strength with these same voters are obvious reasons to doubt the case for Bernie as the unifier, Bernie as the eventual nominee.

Especially since Sanders has thus far ignored my advice (I know, the nerve) that he reassure skeptics by telling them that he has a record as a dealmaker, that he can moderate on certain issues, so they can feel safe supporting him even if they aren’t ready for the revolution.

But still: If you are a wavering Democrat concerned about both party unity and ultimate electability, about exciting all the diverse factions of your base while also competing for the disaffected, both the relative breadth of Bernie’s primary coalition and his decent polling among non-voters and Obama-Trump voters are reasons to give him another look.

That decent polling, I suspect, reflects a sense among voters drawn to populism that Bernie is different from not only the more centrist candidates — latecomers Michael Bloomberg and Deval Patrick especially, but Buttigieg as well — but also from his fellow left-winger, Warren, who has fully embraced the culture-war breadth of the new progressivism while Sanders remains, fundamentally, an economic-policy monomaniac.

He’s still a social liberal, of course, and he isn’t in the culturally conservative/economic populist quadrant where so many unrepresented voters reside. But for the kind of American who is mostly with the Democrats on economics but wary of progressivism’s zest for culture war, Sanders’s socialism might be strangely reassuring — as a signal of what he actually cares about, and what battles he might eschew for the sake of his anti-plutocratic goals. (At the very least he’s no more radical on an issue like abortion than a studied moderate like Mayor Pete.)

This is why, despite technically preferring a moderate like Biden or Amy Klobuchar, I keep coming back to the conservative’s case for Bernie — which rests on the perhaps-wrong but still attractive supposition that he’s the liberal most likely to spend all his time trying to tax the rich and leave cultural conservatives alone.

One day, he decides that he wants a formal portrait of himself. The photographer arrives, but then the phone rings. He starts taking pictures anyway. On the phone is Taft’s friend Theodore Roosevelt, the president. It’s a long conversation, but suddenly, the photographer lucks out. Taft learns that Roosevelt’s chosen him to run for president as his successor. It’s a good choice. Taft goes on to the campaign trail and wins. It’s an historic win because, even though he’s the 27th president, he’s only the first president to win after running a big nationwide campaign tour. Before him, presidential candidates were expected to stay quiet, sit at home. Several decades later — [Music playing] So how did we get here, from a time when personally campaigning for president was unheard of to — We’ll start in 1789. George Washington becomes America’s first president. The founders are hell-bent on making sure a president can’t accumulate too much power. Remember, they just kicked out a king. They don’t want another one of those. They want a president to be humble, like the George Washington depicted here as a simple farmer. If a candidate goes directly to the public, campaigns for themself and asks for votes, it could be a warning sign. They may be power-hungry, a wannabe English king in waiting. “The office must seek the man, not the man the office,” one historian explained. Basically, today’s campaigning would seem very sketchy indeed. Anyway, Washington sets the tone. He’s careful not to appear at all like he wants the presidency. He’s there out of duty. Washington’s example will loom large over presidential candidates for the next century, even as the country quickly changes. This is a political cartoon from 1852. That’s a presidential candidate. That’s a political party boss. And that’s the candidate’s mouth, kept shut. As the country grows, political parties also grow. They choose who the candidates will be and they do all the campaigning on the candidate’s behalf. The candidates, well, they’re expected to stay reserved, Washington-like, mouth shut. But occasionally, candidates campaign anyway. And they’re the ones who slowly chip away at tradition. Let’s go to 1860 for one glaring example. Abraham Lincoln is running against three others for the presidency. One of them decides to throw precedence out the window. Stephen Douglas, a man who’s in danger of losing, decides to go on a big campaign tour. But because of tradition, he can’t just come out and say what he’s doing. So Douglas makes excuses. He says the tour is in order to see his mother in upstate New York, visit his childhood home in Vermont, and watch his brother-in-law graduate from Harvard. Along the way, he makes campaign speeches, and gets heaps of criticism for doing so. The New York Times writes that the presidency is “too high to be reached by a mere stump speaker, and too dignified to be canvassed for like a county clerkship or a seat in Congress.” Douglas, of course, loses, but the size of his stumping tour is another step towards public campaigning. Things will loosen up a bit more, quite by accident, on a front porch in Ohio two decades later. Meanwhile, the political parties have gotten so big and so corrupt there’s a backlash against them. Americans want to interact more with the candidates directly, without the party machines getting in the way. Enter Republican nominee James Garfield. He’s planned to spend the election of 1880 laying low at his home in Ohio, just as candidates usually do. But then, people keep showing up at his house. They want to see their candidate in person. Garfield’s got to say something. He can’t just ignore them. So he gives a bunch of short speeches from his front porch. Garfield has stumbled on a way to personally campaign without risking criticism by going on some big campaign tour. He just does it from home and says it’s because people just showed up. He wins. But this doesn’t turn the tide entirely. 16 years later, however, there’s an upset at the Democratic National Convention. An obscure Nebraska congressman is nominated for president, William Jennings Bryan. He’s so polarizing that many in his party won’t campaign for him. That means Bryan has to do it himself, which is fine, because his whole persona is being a voice for the common people against powerful institutions. It makes sense that he’d ignore political traditions and instead speak to voters himself. He covers 27 states. His opponent, William McKinley, on the other hand, doesn’t hit the road. He takes a page from Garfield’s book, and give speeches from his own front porch. “My fellow citizens —” But it’s all much grander this time. There are parades out front. 750,000 people come to visit. Both strategies are extreme for the time, but McKinley’s is safer. One way to look at what’s going on here is with this pro-McKinley cartoon. It plays up their age difference. McKinley served in the Civil War when Bryan was still a baby. Bryan is now 36, part of a whole new generation. He’s less connected to the colonial traditions that kept candidates at a distance from the public. McKinley ends up winning anyway, but when they have a rematch for president four years later, McKinley doesn’t actively campaign for re-election because now McKinley is a president. And damn the winds of change, remember, the presidency is too sacred an office to use for campaigning. Enter the man so consumed with the limelight that his daughter once said he wanted to be “the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral.” Teddy Roosevelt, McKinley’s running mate. No one said vice presidential candidates can’t stump. As Bryan and Roosevelt go at it in 1900, we see two young, brash candidates drawing crowds with their charisma. Or as historian Gil Troy puts it, they “helped bury a century-old tradition of candidate passivity.” And then four years later, the man who loves a crowd, now President Teddy Roosevelt, falls silent when it’s time to run for his re-election. Presidents still mustn’t campaign. Now is when we come to William Taft, whose big smile we saw at the beginning. And I want to use this image to explain what happens during the election of 1908. On the right is a Taft mannequin. On the left is a William Jennings Bryan mannequin. He’s running again, for a third time. Let’s look closer. There’s a phonograph playing pre-recorded speeches by the candidates. Signs encourage voters to also hear the candidates’ rebuttals to each other. It’s even assumed that voters will pay money to hear all this. That’s how far American norms have shifted in the new century. They expect a more direct democracy with accessible candidates. Now the funny thing about this is, is that Taft is totally against this idea at first. He’s more keen on staying old-school and holding a front porch campaign. No one really shows up. But with Bryan on the road getting all the attention and Taft’s allies pushing him to do the same, he doesn’t have a choice. This is how it works now. He hits the campaign trail, literally following in the footsteps of Bryan. It goes great. He wins. Historian Richard Ellis notes that Taft “helped erase the association between stumping and losing.” Like I said at the beginning, the first president to be elected after making a full campaign tour. It’s not like there’s something about Taft that makes him the first president to stump mightily and win. It’s the combination of incremental changes in American society and behaviors by earlier candidates. If we zip ahead to 1944, we can look back and see just how far things have come. It’s Franklin Roosevelt’s last campaign. At one point, he gets driven 50 miles through the streets of New York City, in an open car, in winter. “And a great welcome from all the boroughs.” An incumbent president pleading his case to the public for a fourth term. The campaigns, the rallies, they all just become part of seeking the presidency. So when you watch presidential candidates on the campaign trail, sitting in diners, riding in buses, shaking hands and taking selfies, and crowd surfing, it’s not quite what the founders intended, but it’s what the people demanded. [Cheering] So five minutes into the video, we talked about President McKinley’s famous front porch campaign. Turns out McKinley is famous for another type of public appearance. His two inaugurations were the first to ever be recorded by a moving picture camera. If you look closely, you can see the chief justice of the Supreme Court raising his hand to give the oath of office. Consequently, McKinley’s was the first presidential funeral to also be filmed. He was assassinated during his second term."
