Bernie Sanders' campaign said Tuesday that the Democratic presidential contender raised $25.3 million during the third quarter, an increase of more than $7 million from his second-quarter haul.

According to the campaign, Sanders' third-quarter total came from more than 1.4 million individual donations. The campaign attributes to boost over its second-quarter total to more than $10 million raised in September alone, a total they said was a record for a single month. The average donation from those donors was $18.07, according to the campaign.

The Vermont independent senator, who sought the Democratic Party's 2016 presidential nomination, has raised about $61.5 million since launching his campaign in February.

""Bernie is proud to be the only candidate running to defeat Donald Trump who is 100 percent funded by grassroots donations — both in the primary and in the general,"" Sanders' campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a release. ""Media elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign, and yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution.""

The big third-quarter haul comes as Sanders has slipped behind both former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in the RealClearPolitics aggregate of several polls.

Meanwhile, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg's campaign announced Tuesday that the Democratic contender raised more than $19.1 million in the third quarter, a dip from the $24.8 million the campaign pulled in in the previous fundraising period. Buttigieg has now raised more than $51 million since the start of 2019.

The Indiana mayor finds himself in fourth place, behind Biden, Warren and Sanders, in the RealClearPolitics average."

* After a couple of difficult months, Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) presidential campaign needed some good news, and a $25.3 million fundraising haul in the third quarter definitely counts as good news for the senator. The total is up from the Vermonter’s $18 million tally from the second quarter.

* Pete Buttigieg also announced third-quarter fundraising totals, and it looks like the mayor raised more than $19.1 million between June and August. That’s down from $24.8 million in the second quarter, but it nevertheless leaves Buttigieg in a strong financial position for the next phase in the race.

* Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) also announced his third-quarter tally: more than $6 million. That’s his best quarter to date, and it’s enough to keep him in the race.

* Sen. Kamala Harris’ (D-Calif.) presidential campaign isn’t where she wants it to be, so the senator is “shaking up the top ranks” of her operation. The change includes moving two top aides from Harris’ Senate staff to her campaign staff.

* The latest Republican National Committee solicitation looks an awful lot like official census materials, which is the sort of misleading scheme partisans are supposed to avoid.

* To the disappointment of Democrats who expected him to lose badly, Corey Lewandowski, Donald Trump’s controversial former campaign manager, conceded this morning that it’s “fair to say” he’s reconsidering plans to run for the U.S. Senate in New Hampshire next year.

* The Atlanta Journal Constitution reports today that new voters in Georgia “have registered in droves” since last year’s elections, and “many of the new voters are racial minorities or under age 30, both groups that are more likely to support Democrats than Republicans.”

* And former Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) wrote a new op-ed, published yesterday, arguing that Trump’s actions “warrant impeachment,” and urging his Republican brethren to end their support for the scandal-plagued president’s re-election."

* Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was hospitalized yesterday in Las Vegas and “underwent a significant medical procedure after a blockage was found in one of his arteries.” As NBC News’ report added, “Sanders, who is 78, has canceled all of his campaign events ‘until further notice.’”

* Buoyed by African-American support, Joe Biden leads the Democratic presidential field in South Carolina according to the latest Winthrop University poll. The former vice president has 37% support, followed by Elizabeth Warren at 17%. Bernie Sanders is third with 8%, followed by Kamala Harris at 7%.

* Speaking of the Palmetto State, some South Carolina Republicans, including former Rep. Bob Inglis, sued the state Republican Party this week “over its decision to cancel its GOP presidential primary next year.”

* As difficult as this may seem to believe, Andrew Yang, a Democratic presidential candidate running for elected office for the first time, raised $10 million in the third quarter. That’s “more than triple the $2.8 million Yang raised in the second quarter.”

* Kamala Harris, meanwhile, raised $11.6 million between July and September, which is awfully close to the $11.8 million she raised in the second quarter.

* Former Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), whose 2020 presidential campaign has struggled to gain traction, has reportedly lost four key aides, including his state directors in Iowa and New Hampshire.

* Joe Biden’s campaign released a new plan on gun policy today, which includes an assault-weapons ban. Under the blueprint, those Americans who already own assault weapons would be required to either register the weapons or sell them to the government.

* Speaking of new 2020 plans, Elizabeth Warren’s campaign unveiled a new proposal this morning that would tax lobbying: “Under her proposal, companies that spend between $500,000 and $1 million a year on lobbying would pay a 35% tax on their expenditures. The rate would increase to 60% for spending of more than $1 million, and to 75% above $5 million.”

* And finally, Donald Trump last week told a rather detailed story about CNN building a multi-million-dollar studio in North Carolina’s 9th congressional district, which he said the network intended to keep up “for weeks” if the Democratic candidate won in a recent special election. Like so many of the president’s bizarre anecdotes, the story was completely made up and had no basis in reality."

The massive fundraising figure is up more than $7 million from his second-quarter numbers.

SANDERS PROPOSES NEW TAX TO TARGET COMPANIES WITH LARGE PAY GAPS

Pete Buttigieg’s campaign also reported early Tuesday morning that the South Bend, Indiana mayor raised $19.1 million the past three months. While impressive, the candidate’s fundraising haul is down from the $24.8 million he brought in during the second quarter, which was the highest among the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls during the April-June quarter.

Sen. Kamala Harris announced raising $11.6 million over the past three months.

The California Democrat's third quarter figure is slightly behind the $11.8 million she brought in during the second quarter and the $12 million she hauled in during the January-March first quarter of fundraising.

Sen. Cory Booker also revealed his third-quarter fundraising figures on Tuesday.

The Democrat from New Jersey's presidential campaign said they raised more than $6 million in July-September period, their best quarter of fundraising to date.

President Trump’s re-election campaign reported on Tuesday that they and the Republican National Committee combined hauled in a massive $125 million in the third quarter. That’s up from their combined $105 million raised during the second quarter.

Unlike some of his rivals for the nomination – such as former Vice President Joe Biden, Buttigieg and Harris – Sanders eschews big donor fundraisers and instead relies solely on grassroots donations. The campaign announced it received 1.4 million donations the past three months.

Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement that ""Bernie is proud to be the only candidate running to defeat Donald Trump who is 100 percent funded by grassroots donations – both in the primary and in the general.""

News of Sanders’ cash haul comes as the populist independent senator from Vermont has faded in many recent polls to third place behind Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who along with Sanders is the other progressive standard-bearer in the 2020 Democratic nomination race.

Shakir argued that “media elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign, and yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution.""

The Sanders campaign announced that its average individual contribution was $19 and that more than 99.9 percent of contributors have not maxed out and are able to donate again to the campaign.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

The Buttigieg campaign highlighted that they’ve now raised more than $51 million since the beginning of the year. They said that 182,000 new people contributed to the campaign in the third quarter, bringing the total number of donors this year to 580,000. The campaign also reported that the average contribution the past three months was $32.

Buttigieg, a one-time long-shot for the nomination, soared in the spring to near top-tier status. While he's continued to haul in large amounts of campaign cash and build up a formidable team in the crucial early voting states, his poll numbers stagnated during the summer.

The Harris campaign, in reporting their fundraising figures, noted that they plan to double their organizing staff in Iowa and South Carolina - the first southern primary - in October and November.

Harris has seen her poll numbers deteriorate over the past two months, but campaign manager Juan Rodriguez pledged that ""this is a campaign that is growing, expanding, and built to win this primary.""

Booker's campaign said that a third of their campaign haul the past three months came during the last 10 days of September, after the candidate announced if he didn't bring in $1.7 million by end of the month, he'd likely drop his White House bid.

Booker's campaign said they'd use their new infusion of campaign cash to hire 40 more staff at headquarters and across the country and open more offices in the early voting states.

Tuesday was the first day campaigns could announce their third-quarter numbers, but they have until Oct. 15 to officially file their fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission.

Campaign cash is a crucial barometer of a candidate’s appeal and popularity and of his or her campaign’s strength. The third-quarter fundraising figures of the Democratic presidential candidates will be heavily analyzed and scrutinized. Fundraising dollars can be used by the candidates to pay for campaign staff and grassroots outreach efforts, travel, and ads."

The Sanders presidential campaign said Tuesday it will spend $1.3 million to run the ads starting Thursday in Iowa, the state that kicks off the primary and caucus nominating calendar.

The 60- and 30-second TV spots – titled “Fights for Us” -- highlight the progressive Vermont senator's decades calling for economic transformation and an end to income inequality.

“Bernie Sanders. Fighting to raise wages for American workers, leading the fight to guarantee health care for all, standing up for civil rights, seniors, veterans and our children’s future,” says the narrator.

The Sanders campaign noted that the ads were produced entirely in-house and that they would run for at least two weeks

News of Sanders’ cash haul comes as the populist senator has faded in many recent national and crucial early-voting state polls to third place. He appears to be lagging former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Warren is the other progressive standard-bearer in the 2020 Democratic nomination race.

WARREN DISHING OUT $10 MILLION TO RUN ADS IN EARLY VOTING STATES

""You can only tax income or transactions, you can't tax net worth,"" he said.

The ""Watters World"" host added America's landmark free-market system is what has led to each generation doing better than its predecessor.

""I want to give it fuel,"" he said of the ""American experiment,"" adding President Trump helped do so by ushering in a tax cut for middle-class families and businesses.

However, he said the president's plan fell short of the most conservative expectations -- which he said would have put Democrats at a disadvantage.

""You know how you give that fuel, you let people keep more of their money -- and that's what Trump did. But he gave the Democrats a little bit too much of an opening because the tax cuts weren't big enough.""

In remarks to supporters in South Carolina, Warren touted her tax plan, claiming it will help all Americans have a better shot at success.

""When you make it so big that you are in the top one-tenth of one percent, pitch in two cents so everybody gets a chance to make it in this country,"" the Massachusetts lawmaker said."

""We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates,"" Sanders' campaign said in a statement.

Sanders himself took to Twitter in the afternoon to reassure his followers that he was on the mend and to do some campaigning for his push for universal healthcare.

""Thanks for all the well wishes,"" Sanders tweeted. ""I'm feeling good. I'm fortunate to have good health care and great doctors and nurses helping me to recover.""

He added: ""None of us know when a medical emergency might affect us. And no one should fear going bankrupt if it occurs. Medicare for All!""

The Vermont senator began to experience some chest discomfort during an event on Tuesday evening in Nevada and was taken to the hospital for a medical evaluation and treatment, where it was discovered that he had a blocked artery.

The Sanders campaign also confirmed to Fox News that they’re postponing a $1.3 million TV ad buy in Iowa that was supposed to hit airwaves in the first caucus state starting on Thursday. The campaign announced the ad just one day ago.

But a senior campaign official told Fox News that overall, “campaign operations are continuing as usual” while the senator is sidelined.

The 78-year-old Sanders, the Democratic field's oldest candidate, sometimes jokingly refers to his age at town halls and other events, especially when interacting with younger participants.

His campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, was on a telephone call with supporters Tuesday night but didn’t mention any health concerns about the candidate. Shakir said the “state of the campaign is strong” and he played up Sanders’ strong fundraising total for the third quarter.

Sanders recently canceled some appearances in South Carolina because he lost his voice. The campaign said at the time he felt fine.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for floating the idea of a wealth tax, claiming it could stifle economic growth and reshape the entire economy.

""Their plans envision an enormous transfer of money from the wealthy to ordinary people, with revenue from the wealth tax used to finance new social programs like tuition-free college, universal childcare and 'Medicare for all,'"" authors Alan Rappeport and Thomas Kaplan wrote.

If rolled out, the plan would deal a massive blow to the coffers of the richest Americans.

""The idea of redistributing wealth by targeting billionaires is stirring fierce debates at the highest ranks of academia and business, with opponents arguing it would cripple economic growth, sap the motivation of entrepreneurs who aspire to be multimillionaires and set off a search for loopholes,"" the op-ed reads.

BERNIE SANDERS CLAIMS 'MEDICARE-FOR--ALL' WILL SLASH HEALTH CARE COSTS WITH TAX HIKE

""Redirecting such vast sums could have unintended effects on the United States economy that go beyond promulgating economic fairness. While Ms. Warren ticks off the social programs that can be funded if the richest Americans pay just 2 cents on every dollar they have above $50 million -- a number that is unimaginable to most Americans -- skeptics warn of economic stagnation, depressed business confidence and a legal battle that would go to the Supreme Court.""

The op-ed also cites growing skepticism among far-left economists, as well as business leaders, as to the viability of such a plan.

""Outnumbered"" also tackled the story on Tuesday, with Fox News contributor Kristen Soltis Anderson calling it a misleading proposal that will negatively trickle down to the middle-class.

""The reason why they make these claims and... always get a little more cagey when you ask how is this going change the tax burden on the average American -- is 70 percent of people in this country consider themselves middle-class,"" she said.

SANDERS UPS ANTE WITH HIGHER WEALTH TAX PROPOSAL THAN WARREN'S: 'BILLIONAIRES SHOULD NOT EXIST'

""They think, it's not going to affect me. Well, the reality is... if it's affecting economic growth, if it's affecting unemployment, it will affect you... The math doesn’t add up on a lot of these programs to be able to pay for them, just by slapping more taxes on the rich.""

Despite the criticisms, ultimately the op-ed endorsed the idea of a wealth tax, calling it a ""political winner"" that could help defeat President Trump in 2020.

""Despite the many obstacles, a wealth tax in the United States could prove to be a political winner for Democrats and serve as a rejoinder to Mr. Trump, who has allowed deficits to swell by cutting taxes without curbing spending,"" the article concluded."

“Not a day goes by that we don't get a call from somebody wanting us to attend a function or two or trying to become involved in our [community],” said Melendez.

The strategy could pay off. While the Native American population in the country remains relatively small, at about 1.5 percent of the general population, they make up a sizable portion of eligible voters in several states or districts, according to data from the National Congress of American Indians, or NCAI. The numbers continue to grow.

ELIZABETH WARREN REVISITS DNA TEST APOLOGIZES TO NATIVE AMERICANS

“[The population] has grown 27 percent since the year 2000. We're a younger crowd that is getting more visible, more educated, more active,” said Kevin Allis, CEO of NCAI.

As more Native Americans gain access to the polls, the voting bloc, which has previously complained about being overlooked, could be pivotal in key primary states like Iowa, Arizona, and Nevada. The latter two states have relatively large Native populations (Nevada has 27 federally recognized tribes) that could make a significant difference.

During the 2016 Iowa caucuses, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., reportedly earned 83.3 percent of the Indian Settlement precinct votes after visiting the Meskwaki settlement. He has credited those votes for helping him almost beat U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: WE NEED AN ECONOMY AND GOVERNMENT THAT WORKS FOR ALL, NOT JUST THE 1 PERCENT

“From top to bottom, in all the different elections, you can see where the margins are that thin. We really have an opportunity to make a difference,” Allis said.

To improve turnout, many Native American voting activists have called for better access to the polls. They say the issue is most pressing in rural areas where some tribal lands may be more than a hundred miles away from a polling location.

“I think Native Americans sometimes are reluctant to go to try to find where the voting site is in the city. But if we can bring those voting sites out to reservation lands, I think we'll have a better turnout,” said Melendez.

Some of the main issues for Indian country include climate change and addressing the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women. But, above all, they’ve called for the federal government to honor the agreements laid out in treaties with Native American nations.

“Native Americans have given up millions of acres of land in exchange for those promises of health care, of law enforcement, all those different governmental needs that we have,” said Melendez.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro have rolled out policy proposals targeting Native Americans. They touched on some of those plans in August during the Frank LaMere Native American Presidential Forum in Sioux City, Iowa, which was organized by the non-profit organization, Four Directions Inc., and considered the first forum in history to exclusively cover Native American issues.

There, Warren apologized for her highly criticized use of a DNA test to prove her Native American ancestry. Her proposal was largely seen as an attempt to soften the blowback from the controversy, which angered many Native Americans and continues to haunt her campaign.

“We really have an opportunity to make a difference, and the candidates are running for office really need to understand that those numbers matter and can win or lose a particular election,” he said.

Moore, a senior economics analyst at the Heritage Foundation, highlighted on “Fox & Friends” a new study that shows median incomes in the middle-class are rising much faster than they did under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.

SANDERS UPS ANTE WITH HIGHER WEALTH TAX PROPOSAL THAN WARREN’S: ‘BILLIONAIRES SHOULD NOT EXIST’

Moore, who helped write the 2017 tax cuts, cited a report from the Census Bureau and said: “Since Donald Trump was elected and took office through July of 2019, median family incomes, middle-class incomes are up $4,100.”

""In the entire eight years that Obama was president, incomes only budged up about $1,000, so in one-third of the time, Trump has increased income by four times as much. We now have a median income of 65,000 dollars. That shows pretty clearly that the middle-class has been benefiting,” he added.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

In his decades in Congress and during both of his runs for the White House, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has railed against an American economic system that he says favors corporations and the rich, at the expense of the working class.

The release of the independent senator from Vermont's ‘Tax on Extreme Wealth’ follows a similar plan from one of his top rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination, fellow progressive and populist lawmaker Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

The Sanders campaign says their plan would impact approximately 180,000 households nationwide and would raise about $4.35 trillion in government revenue by the 2028 budget year.

Moore argued that Democrats are going to have a hard time proving to Americans that their economic policies will be better.

“If these numbers hold up, it’s going to be difficult for any Democrat to beat Donald Trump because he’s proven to be the blue-collar president,” Moore said.

He acknowledged, however, that there was a poor report Tuesday on U.S. manufacturing and exports.

The ISM September Manufacturing Index slipped to 47.8, down 1.3 percentage points from August. A read below 50 signals contraction. More worrisome is new export orders, which hit 41 percent, a 2.3 percentage point drop from last month.

On the roster: Sanders off the trail with heart problems - Huge cash haul for trump - Trump’s team embraces ‘coup’ claim - Pete Sessions goes district shopping - Dana Perino wanted for questioning

SANDERS OFF THE TRAIL WITH HEART PROBLEMS

AP: “Bernie Sanders’ campaign says the Democratic presidential candidate has had a heart procedure for a blocked artery. The Vermont senator is canceling events and appearances ‘until further notice.’ The campaign says the 78-year-old Sanders experienced chest discomfort during an event Tuesday and sought medical evaluation. The campaign says two stents were ‘successfully inserted’ and that Sanders ‘is conversing and in good spirits.’ His campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, was on a telephone call with supporters Tuesday night but didn’t mention any health concerns about the candidate. Shakir said the ‘state of the campaign is strong’ and he played up Sanders’ strong fundraising total for the third quarter. Sanders recently canceled some appearances in South Carolina because he lost his voice. The campaign said at the time he felt fine.”



Biden still strong in South Carolina - Greenville [S.C.] News: “The latest Winthrop Poll results are out and South Carolina democratic voters strongly support former Vice President Joe Biden for the presidency, according to the results. Biden drew 37% of the votes among those surveyed. Among African American democrats and democratic-leaning African Americans, Biden earned 46% of the votes, according to the poll. This is the first Winthrop Poll looking at the 2020 primary candidates. Sen. Elizabeth Warren earned 17%, Sen. Bernie Sanders 8%, Sen. Kamala Harris 7% and the remaining 15 candidates each earned less than 5% support in the poll. … The Winthrop Poll is among the list of qualifying polls [for debate qualifications]. Of the remaining 15 candidates, only South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Cory Booker earned at least 3% approval.”



Warren, Biden neck in neck in New Hampshire - WMUR: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren is now in a virtual dead heat with former Vice President Joe Biden in the first-in-the-nation Democratic presidential primary campaign, according to a new poll. The latest Saint Anselm College Center Survey Center poll shows that Warren’s overall upward trajectory is evident in New Hampshire, as it has been recently in national polls. … Sen. Bernie Sanders, the landslide winner of the 2016 Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire, is in third place with 11 percent, essentially tied with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who was backed by 10 percent of those polled. … Sen. Kamala Harris was the top choice of 5 percent, while U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Sen. Amy Klobuchar received 3 percent each. Philanthropist/activist Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang each received support from 2 percent of those polled, while Sen. Cory Booker was backed by 1 percent.”



Yang brings in big bucks with free money plan - Axios: “2020 candidate Andrew Yang's campaign says it raised $10 million in 2019's third quarter, according to Politico. Why it matters: Yang's Q3 report is more than triple the $2.8 million he raised in the second quarter — a push powered by some strong debate performances that elevated his national profile. The state of play: Yang outpaced Sen. Cory Booker’s $6 million and came close to Sen. Kamala Harris’ $11.6 million. … Yang's campaign said nearly 300,000 people have donated — almost double the threshold required to qualify for the November debate. … Yang's campaign told Politico that it received $1 million in the 72 hours after the September debate in which he announced that he was giving away $120,000 to 10 families over a year to promote signature campaign proposal: universal basic income, branded by Yang as the ‘freedom dividend.’”



HUGE CASH HAUL FOR TRUMP

AP: “President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee raised $125 million in the third quarter of the year, a presidential fundraising record. The pro-Trump effort said Tuesday that it has raised more than $308 million in 2019 and has more than $156 million in the bank. Republicans aim to use the fundraising haul to fight off Democrats’ impeachment effort. Former President Barack Obama and the DNC raised just over $70 million in the third quarter of 2011. ‘President Trump has built a juggernaut of a campaign, raising record amounts of money at a record pace,’ said Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale. RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel credited Democratic attacks on Trump for motivating supporters to donate in record numbers.”



GOP moves to stifle dissent in Charlotte - NYT: “President Trump’s political advisers have concluded a monthslong effort to tighten the rules for choosing delegates to the Republican National Convention, all but ensuring there are no dissenting speeches at the gathering of party officials in Charlotte next year. On Tuesday, state Republican parties submitted to the national committee their delegate allocation plans, the methods by which they will choose and bind delegates who attend the convention as their representatives. In 37 states and territories, there have been changes to the rules that will all but stamp out the possibility of any raucous divide on the convention floor. … The new delegate guidelines are the culmination of a 10-month effort by Trump advisers to strengthen the president’s grip on the Republican Party ahead of the general election. It means that even if the three candidates challenging Mr. Trump in the Republican primary gain vote shares, they almost certainly won’t translate into speeches or jeers from supporters of these candidates when the convention is taking place.”



South Carolina Republicans sue over nixed primary - The [Charleston, S.C.] Post and Courier: “Two Republicans, one of them former congressman Bob Inglis, have sued the S.C. Republican Party over its decision to cancel its GOP presidential primary next year. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in state court in Richland County, alleges the party scrapped its 2020 election contest illegally and violated party rules and state election law. The suit further contends the near-unanimous decision made by the party’s Executive Committee deprives Inglis, of Greenville, and fellow plaintiff Frank Heindel of Mount Pleasant, of their right to vote for the candidate of their choosing in a primary. … The suit comes after the Executive Committee met Sept. 7 in Columbia and voted to forgo a presidential primary. The move effectively cleared the way for Republican incumbent President Donald Trump to receive all of the state’s nominating delegates without contest.”



THE RULEBOOK: POPULISM 101

“By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 10



TIME OUT: WHAT A BUNCH OF CRETANS

NatGeo: “Deep inside the Labyrinth on the island of Crete lived a Minotaur, a monster half man, half bull. … The story of the Minotaur has thrilled people for thousands of years and inspired myriad works of art: pottery, poetry, plays, the art of Picasso, operas, movies, and video games. Although the myth can be enjoyed as a satisfying tale, archaeologists now know that its fabulous qualities have roots deep in real events in the Bronze Age. The bull-headed man in Minos’s maze embodies several traits found in the culture of Crete and ancient Minoan civilization. Bulls and maze motifs are found throughout Minoan culture, which dominated the Mediterranean from about 3000 B.C. to about 1100 B.C. In confronting and overcoming the bull—a symbol of Crete—Theseus, the legendary founder of Athens, reflects the flowering of Aegean civilizations beginning in the middle of the second millennium B.C., as mainland Greece replaced Crete as the dominant power.”

TRUMP’S TEAM EMBRACES ‘COUP’ CLAIM

Mediaite: “President Donald Trump decried the House of Representatives’ impeachment inquiry as a ‘coup,’ and it looks like his campaign is embracing that rhetoric to blast Democrats. Trump echoed similar comments made on Fox News in the past few days, including from trade advisor Peter Navarro this week. And now Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted this afternoon Democrats should be working on policies ‘that help America instead of trying to overthrow our government with a coup’ And the Trump campaign has a new ad out today — called ‘Coup’ — accusing Democrats of orchestrating ‘nothing short of a coup’ against the president.”



Senate GOP could take up impeachment only to drop it - NYT: “Senator Mitch McConnell’s comment this week that the Senate would be forced to ‘take up’ articles of impeachment from the House had the capital in a swirl, bracing for a full-blown Senate trial of President Trump. But as things now stand, any trial would likely be swift, ending in dismissal of the accusations. While the focus was on the statement by Mr. McConnell, the majority leader, that the Senate would have ‘no choice’ but to begin an impeachment proceeding, it was his next line that might have been more telling: ‘How long you are on it is a whole different matter.’ The fusty rules of the Senate make clear that Republicans could not unilaterally stonewall articles of impeachment of Mr. Trump as they did the Supreme Court nomination of Merrick B. Garland. But Mr. McConnell’s declaration suggests the Republican-controlled Senate could move expeditiously to toss them out if Republicans conclude the House impeachment is meritless, or a strictly partisan affair.”



Steyer PAC spends big to target Republican senators on impeachment - WaPo: “A group pushing for the impeachment of President Trump is launching a $3.1 million ad campaign targeting Republican senators over the coming weeks as pro-impeachment activists turn their fire away from Democratic holdouts and toward members of the president’s own party. The group, Need to Impeach, is funded mainly by billionaire Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer. Top executives said Tuesday that more than half of the ad campaign money will go toward television spots, with the rest underwriting digital ads. The campaign will focus on Republican Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Cory Gardner (Colo.) and Martha McSally (Ariz.), all of whom are seeking reelection next year and could cast votes in the coming months on whether Trump should be removed from office.”



Cheney sends House Republicans home with talking points - WashEx: “Republican leaders in the House of Representatives sent the rank-and-file home with one overriding message to deliver to voters in their districts: There is no evidence that warrants an impeachment inquiry into President Trump. The bulleted talking points, prepared by Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, also attack House Democrats as disorganized and the impeachment process as illegitimate, primarily because Nancy Pelosi declined to hold a floor vote on whether to open the inquiry. Cheney argues in her messaging guidance that Democrats have been intent on impeaching Trump for more than two years. An investigation into Trump's harmless telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, she asserts, is just the Democrats' latest excuse to justify their attempt to undo the 2016 election.”



PETE SESSIONS GOES DISTRICT SHOPPING

Texas Tribune: “Former Republican U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions appears poised to make a comeback attempt — but not in his old Dallas-based district. Sessions, who lost reelection last year, plans to announce Thursday he's running for the seat being vacated by retiring U.S. Rep. Bill Flores, according to McLennan County GOP Chairman Jon R. Ker. The announcement will be at the county party headquarters in Waco, added Ker, who said he spoke with Sessions on Tuesday. Sessions' anticipated run is a surprise development after he spent months publicly flirting with running for his previous 32nd District seat, which is about 80 miles north of Flores' more Republican 17th District. The initial reaction ‘has not been positive,’ Flores told The Texas Tribune late Tuesday. ‘Pete is a friend of mine, but I wish he'd called me first,’ said Flores, R-Bryan. ‘I could have provided some valuable feedback to him.’”



Tenney signs up for rematch to reclaim seat - Roll Call: “Former Rep. Claudia Tenney, one of President Donald Trump’s most vocal supporters last Congress, announced Tuesday she will run for her old seat in New York’s 22nd District. Tenney lost by less than 2 percentage points in the 2018 midterms to Democratic Rep. Anthony Brindisi despite running one of the most pro-Trump campaigns of any vulnerable House Republican. The president carried New York’s 22nd District by 15 percentage points in 2016. ‘Upstate New York deserves a representative who will fight for their values in Congress, someone who will work to deliver actual results, not resistance,’ Tenney said in a press release Tuesday.”



Lewandowski shies from Senate run - Politico: “Corey Lewandowski told a local radio host Tuesday ‘it’s fair’ to say he is reconsidering a Senate run in order to defend President Donald Trump from impeachment and help him get reelected. ‘As much as I think I would be a great fighter for the people of New Hampshire, and one U.S. senator can make a difference, it is my priority to make sure the president of United States is reelected,’ Lewandowski said on the radio show, ‘New Hampshire Today with Jack Heath.’ ‘That's a top priority.’ The president's brash and outspoken former campaign manager would have to go up against three other Republicans looking to unseat Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.”

“You don't really want to identify with anybody on that show. The only character with any kind of moral purity to them is Gary, the body guy. But it's not like you really want to be him.” – Mayor Pete Buttigieg when asked which character from HBO’s Veep he relate most to during an interview with the Hollywood Reporter.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Just curious about the railroad spike on the trophy plaque behind you.” – Martin Jarvis, Wright City, Mo.



[Ed. note: Now that’s what I call observant viewership, Mr. Jarvis! Other viewers of our show on Fox Nation may have seen that simple wooden board with a rusty railroad spike behind me. It is from the Monongha Mine in Marion County, W.Va., the scene of the worst mine disaster in American history. On Dec. 6, 1907 at least 362 men were killed when the poorly-ventilated mine filled with methane gas, which exploded with terrible force, killing almost all instantly. Any effort to evacuate the mine would have been badly complicated by a language barrier. The lion’s share of the miners were Italian immigrants, but there would have been Hungarians, Czechs and other non-English speakers working in crews of their own, making it hard for English-speaking foremen to direct an escape as the inferno spread from section to section. The blast collapsed much of the roof and destroyed the rail lines in and out of the mine. That spike came from one of those shattered rail ties and was given long ago to my father, a coal salesman, by a West Virginia coal operator whose own father had saved it after the explosion. I love the way it looks and it goes along with some other ancient mine memorabilia in my office, including a carbide lamp miner’s helmet. But I also love it as a memento of how much I have to be thankful for. My work here in this comfortable, air-conditioned office is safe, well-compensated and personally rewarding. It’s a far cry from the coal pits where so many men toiled and sometimes died. That little spike reminds me of who I am, where I’m from, my dear old dad and, most of all, to be grateful.]

CBS12: “A man in Fort Lauderdale is accused of tampering with dozens of electric scooters. Authorities have been investigating the vandalism of more than 140 scooters since April. One incident is caught on surveillance video, which police released to the public in an effort to identify a suspect. The investigation led to the arrest of 59-year-old Randall Thomas Williams. Police said they found 20 scooters nearby with severed brake lines. Police say Williams is the one who cut the brake lines on the scooters. He faces criminal mischief charges. Investigators have not revealed a motive. Police are asking anyone who finds an electric scooter that appears to have been tampered with to contact the vendor.”

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., had an accompanying Facebook page taken down after it was deemed in violation of Facebook's policy against impersonation -- a decision the company eventually reversed Tuesday.

William Jacobson, a law professor at Cornell Law School, owns and runs elizabethwarrenwiki.org — a website dedicated to various controversies surrounding the Democratic presidential candidate, particularly her claims of having Native American heritage.

ZUCKERBERG SAYS IF WARREN BECOMES PRESIDENT, FACEBOOK WOULD SUE US GOVERNMENT

He also ran an accompanying Facebook page, which posted articles from the site.

“It was a way of getting the content out to the public,” he told Fox News in an interview.

But on Monday afternoon, Jacobson received a notice saying the page had been taken down for violating Facebook's policies regarding impersonation. Facebook’s community standards forbid users from using other peoples’ images to deceive or mislead people about the origin of the content.

""Pages, groups and events must not impersonate or falsely represent a brand, entity or public figure,"" the policies state. ""Where a Page, group or event is being used to express support for or interest in a brand, entity or public figure, it must make clear in the name or description that it is not an official representation.""

But Jacobson maintains the page was in line with Facebook standards as it carried a disclaimer saying it was not affiliated with Warren’s campaign or Senate office. He posted a screengrab of the disclaimer in an article for Legal Insurrection. He also said the site never attempted to impersonate Warren, even with the disclaimer.

“The page is called 'Elizabeth Warren Wiki' and it has a link to the wiki website and all of the content posted was from the wiki website, so no one could look at the page and think this is her campaign or Senate office because everything was from the wiki website,” he said.

“I think we covered all our bases, and I don’t know how this happened,” he said.

Jacobson said he immediately filed an appeal via the Facebook process. By Tuesday evening, the page was restored.

""This page was mistakenly removed and has been restored,"" Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesman, told Fox News in an email.

In his original article flagging his concerns, Jacobson wrote: ""It’s another reminder, as when our YouTube page was taken down without warning, that we can’t rely on big tech.""

Before the page was restored, Jacobson wondered if a recent feud between Warren’s supporters and those of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was partly responsible.

“All I know is the last couple of days there was a Twitter war between Bernie and Warren supporters, and Bernie’s supporters were linking to the wiki website,” he said. “It might be pure coincidence or it might be that someone decided to complain to Facebook about the page.”

The suspension came just as comments emerged from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg warning that the company may have to sue the government if Warren becomes president.

""You have someone like Elizabeth Warren thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies … I mean, if she gets elected president then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,"" Zuckerberg said in July, according to The Verge."

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joe Biden.

The new survey, conducted by the Saint Anselm College Survey Center and released Tuesday, also shows Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont – who crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 New Hampshire primary – in a distant third place.

Warren, the populist senator who’s pushed out one progressive policy proposal after another, stands at 25 percent in the survey. Biden, the front-runner in most polls of voters nationwide and in early primary and caucus states since before announced his candidacy in late April, is at 24 percent. The margin between Warren and Biden is well within the poll's margin of error of 4.8 percentage points.

WARREN EDGES BIDEN, SANDERS SLIPS, IN NEW NH PRIMARY POLL

“There remain several months before New Hampshire Democrats cast their primary ballots, but Warren and Biden have clearly separated themselves from the rest of the field,” New Hampshire Institute of Politics executive director Neil Levesque emphasized.

“If the dynamic of Warren as the candidate that best expresses Democratic voters’ policy preferences and Biden as the one who has the best chance of beating Trump sets in with voters, this is likely turning into a two-person race absent a big shake-up,” he added.

Sanders, the populist independent senator, stands at 11 percent in the survey, with South Bend, Ind. Mayor Buttigieg a point back at 10 percent. Sen. Kamala Harris of California registers at 5 percent in the survey to round out the top five.

The poll’s release comes hours after Sanders reported raising a whopping $25.3 million during the July-September third quarter of fundraising, with Buttigieg hauling in $19.1 million and Harris bringing in $11.6 million.

SANDERS HAULS IN AN EYE-POPPING $25 MILLION JULY-SEPT. CAMPAIGN CASH HAUL

Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii are each at 3 percent in the survey. Businessman and billionaire environmental and progressive activist Tom Steyer and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang are each at 2 percent, with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey at 1 percent. Everyone else sampled came in at less than 1 percent, with 9 percent undecided with just over four months to go until primary day.

Levesque highlighted that “there is still some fluidity in this race, as 65 percent of Warren supporters, 72 percent of Biden supporters, 56 percent of Sanders supporters, and 73 percent of Buttigieg voters indicate that they expect that their choice could change between now and the primary election.”

Among voters who were not firm in their choice of candidate, was the second choice of 26 percent, followed by Biden (12 percent), Buttigieg (11 percent), Sanders and Harris (7 percent each)

Warren also topped the field of candidates on the question of who would make the best president (27 percent, compared to 19 percent who picked Biden). But Biden came out on top when voters were asked who would be the strongest nominee to take on Republican President Donald Trump in next year’s general election (37 percent, compared to 26 percent who picked Warren).

The St. Anselm poll came out a week after a Monmouth University survey in New Hampshire grabbed national attention for indicating that Warren and Biden fighting for the top spot, with Sanders a distant third.

Previous Granite State polls released earlier in September and in late August were all over the board, with one suggesting Sanders holding a lead; another indicating a three-way tie among Biden, Warren and Sanders; and a third showing Sanders trailing Biden and Warren.

YANG TELLS FOX NEWS 'I WOULD NEVER WISH FOR' A RECESSION

Yang’s campaign also reported $6.3 million cash on hand as of the end of September and noted that the funds will go towards building up staff and infrastructure in the early voting primary and caucus states.

""Andrew Yang is the only contender showing exponential growth in the third quarter, more than tripling his fundraising number from last quarter,"" campaign manager Zach Graumann touted. ""This grassroots fundraising total, with over $6m in the bank, ensures this campaign will have the funding to compete and outperform expectations through Super Tuesday and beyond.""

Yang has become a serious contender for the Democratic nomination thanks to the popularity of his so-called ""Freedom Dividend."" That’s Yang’s universal basic income proposal to give each adult American $1,000 a month to ease the economic pain stemming from lost jobs due to automation and artificial intelligence. He says he’ll pay for the program by implementing a national value-added tax.

YANG'S CAMPAIGN CASH GIVEAWAYS RAISE LEGAL CONCERNS

He's also built a strong and devout base of grassroots supporters and donors, known as the Yang Gang. Thanks to his fundraising prowess and polling, Yang has made the stage for all the Democratic primary debates to date, something that some better-known governors and senators failed to do.

Yang closed out the third quarter of fundraising by headlining a rally in Los Angeles that drew some 5,000 people, according to his campaign. And they noted that Yang raised $2.28 million in the last ten days of September.

""Wow, we ended the quarter on the biggest rush of donations ever!"" Yang tweeted on Tuesday night. ""Thank you to everyone who worked your heart out to exceed our goal - you all are amazing!""

SANDERS HAULS IN A WHOPPING $25.3 MILLION IN THIRD QUARTER

The campaign cash figure from Yang, while impressive, paled in comparison to the whopping $25.3 million Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont hauled in during the third quarter. The Sanders campaign announced its fundraising figures early Tuesday morning.

South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg brought in $19.1 million over the past three months. Sen. Kamala Harris of California reported bringing in $11.6 million, with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey raising over $6 million.

President Trump’s re-election team announced that they and the Republican National Committee combined hauled in a massive $125 million in the third quarter.

TRUMP'S RECORD-BREAKING $125 MILLION FUNDRAISING HAUL

Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado also released his fundraising figures on Wednesday. The long-shot contender for the nomination reported raising $2.1 million over the past three months, with $1.8 million cash on hand. The campaign noted that 86 percent of contributions were $25 or less.

“Our strategy to run a lean, strong campaign in early states is working, and we have the resources to compete and win. We’re continuing to run TV, rural radio, and digital ads and build out our infrastructure and staff,” Bennet campaign spokesperson Shannon Beckham emphasized.

Bennet didn’t make the cut for last month’s Democratic nomination debate and failed to qualify for this month’s showdown as well. That has not discouraged Bennet's campaign.

""Instead of allowing the DNC’s flawed debate criteria to dictate this race, we’re communicating directly with voters and caucusgoers,” Beckham said, taking aim at the Democratic National Committee’s thresholds to qualify for the debate."

The Democratic National Committee (DNC) on Wednesday announced the lineup for their Oct. 15 fourth-round presidential primary debate, and as expected, 12 candidates have qualified, meeting the polling and fundraising criteria.

That means the showdown will be the largest in presidential primary history, topping the 11 Republicans who faced off in a primary debate in September 2015, according to political research from Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a political newsletter and website.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

The dozen Democratic White House contenders who made the cut are – in alphabetical order – former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; businessman and environmental advocate Tom Steyer; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

The first two rounds of debates in June and July – with lower qualifying thresholds – were held over two consecutive nights with 10 candidates on the stage each evening. The thresholds were raised for the third-round debate, resulting in 10 candidates facing off on one night.

The DNC announced last week that the fourth-round debate would also be held on a single night. The 10 contenders who faced off in September automatically qualified for the October debate. And Gabbard and Steyer, who narrowly missed the September cut, reached the thresholds to qualify for the upcoming showdown by Tuesday’s deadline.

2020 DEMOCRATIC FIELD POISED FOR NEW PURGE WITH KEY DEADLINES APPROACHING

Twelve candidates on the same stage at the same time could make for an unwieldy debate and a lot of jockeying for time and attention.

Steyer told Fox News on Wednesday that “the DNC makes decisions and I try not to think about them.”

He emphasized that “the debates are a huge opportunity and that’s how I hope to use them,” but he also acknowledged that “if there are more people on the stage, then it’s harder, and I just have to deal with that.”

The Oct. 15 debate will be held at Otterbein University, a liberal arts institution in Westerville, Ohio. The DNC’s media partners for the showdown are CNN and The New York Times."

TRUMP CAMPAIGN, GOP RAKE IN MILLIONS IN 24 HOURS AFTER PELOSI ANNOUNCES IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

“President Trump has built a juggernaut of a campaign, raising record amounts of money at a record pace,” said Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale.

Republican insiders say that the impeachment effort against Trump could be a fundraising boon for the GOP.

WinRed, the new GOP online fundraising platform designed to compete for small-dollar campaign donations, reported raising a little more than $30 million in the third fundraising quarter, which began in July and ended Monday.

The online platform is used to raise money for President Trump’s re-election, campaign committees and various Republican candidates across the country.

WinRed President Gerrit Lansing said the Democrats’ moves to ramp up impeachment efforts against Trump “helped a lot,” saying fundraising numbers “spiked” after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s announcement of a formal inquiry last week.

WinRed has raised more than $13.7 million from over 276,000 contributors since the announcement by Pelosi, he said.

“It just poured gas on the situation where there is a ton of money being raised in all levels and all campaigns,” Lansing said.

RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel also credited Democratic attacks on Trump for motivating supporters to donate in record numbers.

“We are investing millions on the airwaves and on the ground to hold House Democrats accountable, highlight their obstruction, and take back the House and reelect President Trump in 2020,” she said.

The fundraising announcement comes as the pro-Trump groups launched their first major advertising campaign of the cycle. Trump’s team aims to devote $1 billion to his reelection.

However, Democrats are also putting up big fundraising numbers – albeit not as large as Trump’s campaign.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders hauled in a whopping $25.3 million during the third quarter of fundraising, up more than $7 million from his second-quarter numbers.

Pete Buttigieg’s campaign also reported Tuesday that the South Bend, Indiana mayor raised $19.1 million over the past three months. While impressive, the candidate’s fundraising haul is down from the $24.8 million he brought in during the second quarter, which was the highest among the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls during the April-June quarter.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California said she had raised $11.6 million over the past three months. That figure is slightly behind the $11.8 million she brought in during the second quarter and the $12 million she hauled in during the January-March first quarter of fundraising.

Sen. Cory Booker also revealed his third-quarter fundraising figures on Tuesday. The Democrat from New Jersey's presidential campaign said they raised more than $6 million between July 1 and Sept. 30, their best quarter of fundraising to date.

A Monmouth University survey suggests that Biden – one of the co-frontrunners in the Democratic race to face off next year against the president – could suffer some political damage from the Ukrainian allegations that sparked the Democrat-controlled House to formally launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump.

POLL SUGGESTS SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT GROWS, WITH AMERICANS NOW SPLIT

The survey, released Wednesday, indicates that a plurality of voters believed Trump’s accusations against Biden on that issue.

Trump and Biden each face a distinct set of allegations with regard to Ukraine. Trump is under fire from Democrats over his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he urged Zelensky to investigate the Biden family over their dealings in Ukraine. A whistleblower, along with Democrats, argue Trump in essence was asking a foreign country to potentially interfere in a U.S. election.

Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has repeatedly described his phone call with the Ukrainian leader as “perfect.”

At the same time, the president has sought to turn the tables on Biden by highlighting allegations against the former vice president and his son that he wanted investigated.

Biden’s son Hunter served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – who had been widely accused of overlooking corruption in his own office – was later dismissed. Trump’s re-election campaign last week launched a new TV and digital ad targeting Biden over his alleged actions.

The Monmouth poll indicates that 43 percent of registered voters believe Trump’s claim that Biden did pressure Ukrainian officials to keep them from investigating his son’s business ties, with 37 percent not buying the president’s allegations and one in five unsure.

Among crucial self-identified independent voters, 39 percent believe that Biden pressured Ukrainian officials, with 27 percent disagreeing and a third unsure.

“The fact that 4-in-10 independents are inclined to believe what they have heard from Trump is a warning sign for the Biden campaign. How the candidate fights back against this charge will be crucial to his argument of electability,” Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray said in a statement.

Biden's allies maintain he intervened in Ukraine over corruption concerns, not because of his son's work.

And Biden once again emphasized on Wednesday that ""there’s zero, zero evidence, of any assertion made.""

The survey also spells trouble for Trump, with just four in 10 registered voters continuing to say that the president should be re-elected, compared with 57 percent who say it’s time to have someone new in the White House.

“Trump’s base is sticking with him, but these results suggest that the president remains particularly weak among voting blocs that were crucial to putting him over the top in 2016,” Murray said.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

The survey is also the latest to indicate the race for the Democratic nomination is turning into a two-candidate battle between Biden and progressive champion Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

Warren stands at 28 percent support among self-identified Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters, with the former vice president at 25 percent. Warren’s advantage is within the survey’s sampling error.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, the populist independent senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House run, stands at 15 percent. Biden, Sanders and Warren were all tied in Monmouth’s previous poll, conducted in August.

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is at 5 percent in the survey, along with Sen. Kamala Harris of California. Tech-entrepreneur Andrew Yang and best-selling spiritual author Marianne Williamson are at 2 percent in the poll, with 11 other contenders in the record-setting Democratic field registering at 1 percent or less.

The Monmouth University poll was conducted Sept. 23-29, with 1,161 people questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s overall margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points."

Appearing on ""America's Newsroom"" with co-anchors Bill Hemmer and Sandra Smith, Sanders said that the administration is fighting back and trying to expose the ""real scandal.""

She told Hemmer and Smith that, ""the only corruption in this entire process has to do with the Bidens. It's not the president. It's not the White House. It's the fact that Joe Biden was acting inappropriately and making probably sweetheart deals for his son.""

TRUMP SEEKS TO TURN TABLES ON BIDEN AMID IMPEACHMENT PROBE

""The hypocrisy and the level of fake outrage from the Democrats is really astonishing and something that hopefully the media and the American people will continue to call out as this process plays out,"" Sanders said.

Sanders' statements come as House Democrats dive headfirst into an impeachment inquiry, driving their initiative toward a potential vote by the end of the year. The chairmen of three House committees issued separate subpoenas to both the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Additionally, they are seeking testimony from former State Department officials over the next couple of weeks.

The probe was launched after a whistleblower's disclosure of a July phone call with the Ukrainian president in which he asked for help in investigating the Biden family. Shortly after, the White House released a transcript of the call. Sanders had already left her post at the White House in July.

""I think the big thing here is the whistleblower's complaint doesn't matter because we have the transcript,"" she urged. ""The White House has been fully transparent in this process...I don't think that there's anything that the whistleblower can tell us that isn't in that [transcript].""

Sanders also noted that readers could see there was ""nothing inappropriate"" about the call: ""There was no quid pro quo. The president was acting as he should have.""

She told Hemmer and Smith that the ""biggest thing here"" is that ""[House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi made her impeachment inquiry announcement prior to ever having any information.""

""There was a study done early on in this administration that there were more leaks within the first six months of classified state secret information than any other administration in history,"" said Sanders.

""That shows, I think, the true nature of what this. It's all about politics,"" she lamented."

SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT JUMPS 10 POINTS

Quinnipiac University: “American voters are divided on impeaching and removing President Trump from office, 47 - 47 percent - closing a 20 point gap from less than a week ago, according to a Quinnipiac University Poll released [Monday]. In the poll released on September 25th, voters said that the president should not be impeached and removed 57 - 37 percent. Among the political party subgroups, Democrats showed the greatest change from the last poll. [Monday], they show a virtual consensus on impeaching Trump, 90 - 5 percent, while last week they said Trump should be impeached 73 - 21 percent. … While voters are split on impeaching and removing President Trump from office, a slim majority of registered voters do approve of the impeachment inquiry opened by the U.S. House of Representatives 52 - 45 percent. Approval includes half of independents, who are split 50 - 45 percent on the inquiry.”



No change in job approval - Monmouth University: “President Donald Trump’s approval rating has remained steady in the wake of an official impeachment inquiry launched last week, although support for impeachment has ticked up slightly. In a two year Monmouth University Poll trend on impeachment opinion the current findings are not out of line with some prior results. … Trump’s overall job rating stands at 41% approve and 53% disapprove, which is similar to his 40% to 53% rating in August. … At this time, 44% of Americans feel that Trump should be impeached and compelled to leave the presidency, while 52% disagree with this course of action. These numbers mark a shift from Monmouth’s prior poll in August (35% supported impeachment and 59% did not), but it is not the first time these results have been found in the two years Monmouth has been asking this question.”



The war room is the Oval Office - Politico: “A week after House Democrats jump-started their impeachment inquiry, the White House has yet to converge on any single plan, strategy or even unified messaging to fight back. All the talk about setting up a so-called war room inside the West Wing, similar to the approach of the Clinton White House, has gone nowhere. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, other top aides, lawyers and Trump advisers have been jockeying among their own internal factions for control of the approach or messaging. … The infighting over the fate of a war room reflects the long-standing operational styles of the Trump White House and 2016 campaign over the past four years, during which personnel battles often overshadowed any well-honed strategy. The president has always preferred to run his White House with a team-of-rivals approach, with aides fighting over various policies or political options and Trump alone as the decider at the center of the action. The impeachment battle may be no different.”



Giuliani called to testify - Fox News: “The chairmen of three House committees subpoenaed President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani on Monday for key documents related to the Ukraine controversy as part of their formal impeachment inquiry against Trump. ‘Pursuant to the House of Representatives’ impeachment inquiry, we are hereby transmitting a subpoena that compels you to produce the documents set forth in the accompanying schedule by October 15, 2019,’ Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel and Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, all Democrats, wrote. … The committee chairs subpoenaed Giuliani after claiming he admitted to being ‘in possession of evidence — in the form of text messages, phone records, and other communications — indicating that you were not acting alone and that other Trump administration officials may have been involved in this scheme.’”

BERNIE BANKS BIG CASH, BUT BUTTIGIEG WOWS

WaPo: “Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) raised $25.3 million during the past three months for his White House bid, his campaign said Tuesday, fueled by an army of low-dollar donors to post the largest quarterly haul so far this year among the Democratic presidential contenders. Sanders transferred an additional $2.6 million from his other federal campaign accounts, the campaign said. The third-quarter figures announced by the campaign rival his $26 million haul at this point in the primary campaign in 2015, when he stunned the Democratic field by nearly matching the total of his opponent, Hillary Clinton, with an infusion of money from donors giving less than $200. Yet this time, he is facing more than a dozen opponents. One of them, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, announced early Tuesday that his campaign raised more than $19.1 million in the third quarter — less than Sanders did but an amount that gives him staying power in a crowded field.”



Harris shuffles staff as candidacy flounders - Politico: “Kamala Harris is shaking up the top ranks of her presidential campaign, the latest sign her once-promising bid is failing to meet expectations. The staff moves amount to a significant reorganization for a campaign that’s dropped so far in polls that it risks becoming a postscript in the Democratic primary. Harris’ light early-state schedule, hiccups on the trail and lack of consistency in delivering her message have consumed much of the attention and blame for her mounting struggles. Behind the scenes, aides said a lack of clarity among staff surrounding the roles of Campaign Manager Juan Rodriguez and Campaign Chair Maya Harris, the candidate’s sister, and inexperience across the organization are feeding a growing sense of indecision and aimlessness inside the campaign. … The campaign did not start holding regular senior staff meetings until September — nine months after launching — leading to a lack of coordination across departments.”



GOP FUNDRAISING PLATFORM OPENS BIG

Fox News: “WinRed, the new GOP online fundraising platform designed to compete with Democrats in the battle for small-dollar campaign donations, has raised more than $30 million since launching three months ago, with top officials crediting the Democrats’ impeachment push for a big spike in fundraising over the last week, Fox News has learned. WinRed raised just over $30 million in the third fundraising quarter, which began in July and ended Monday. The online platform is used to raise money for President Trump’s re-election, campaign committees and various Republican candidates across the country. In an interview, WinRed's president, Gerrit Lansing, said the Democrats’ moves to ramp up impeachment efforts against Trump ‘helped a lot,’ saying fundraising numbers ‘spiked’ after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s announcement of a formal inquiry last week. WinRed has raised over $13.7 million from over 276,000 contributors since the announcement from Pelosi, D-Calif., he said.”

The comments, obtained by The Verge, span a wide range of topics and deep insight into Zuckerberg's thinking, going much further than the usually stoic CEO appears in public. ‘You have someone like Elizabeth Warren thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies … I mean, if she gets elected president then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,’ Zuckerberg is quoted as saying in two Q&A sessions with Facebook employees during July.”



Court upholds 2017 ruling cancelling net neutrality rules - WaPo: “A federal appeals court on Tuesday affirmed that the Federal Communications Commission acted lawfully when it scrapped the U.S. government’s net neutrality rules in 2017, but it opened the door for state and local governments to introduce their own regulations designed to treat all web traffic equally. … In a nearly 200-page opinion, judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals largely sided with the Federal Communications Commission and its Republican chairman, Ajit Pai. While the agency must return to the drawing board on some elements of its repeal, the court upheld the breadth of its work, finding that net neutrality supporters had made ‘unconvincing’ arguments in their efforts to override the FCC’s deregulation of companies such as AT&T, Comcast and Verizon.”

“There is an element of feeling a little bit like a traveling troubadour.” – Andrew Yang to CNN explaining that his rallies make him feel more like a traveling musician than a political candidate.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“‘….you might even find some historians with strong feelings about what happened to old Andy Johnson.’ I’m one of those historians. His impeachment in 1868 was purely political because the radical republicans didn’t like a Democrat who didn’t share their views on implementing a harsh Reconstruction on the Old Confederacy. In fact one of the 11 articles of impeachment included a notation that he was unable to get along with the Congress (or words to that effect). All the other impeachments – Nixon, Clinton – involved criminal activity by the President. Now it appears we have another Johnsonian impeachment looming. The only thing that saved Johnson was the lobbying by Thomas Ewing Jr. of Kansas Senator Edmund Ross. Ewing was a well-known lobbyist in Washington after the war and had defended several of the Lincoln conspirators (Dr. Mudd). Ross was a radical republican who ended up being the key vote against impeachment. Ewing was Ross’ old commanding officer in the 11th Kansas Infantry during the Civil War.” – Ron Smith, Larned, Kan.



[Ed. note: I knew you were out there somewhere, Mr. Smith! Thank you for sharing that fabulous Kansas fact. I would only quibble with your assessment to say this: All impeachments are political. It is the nature of the enterprise. Now, I certainly agree that what the radical Republicans did to Johnson was pretty shoddy, he was also a spectacularly terrible president. He did not need to take the bait that Congress put out in front of him. Our point in discussing impeachment is that many presidents have done rotten things and not been impeached for them and a few presidents have done rotten things and been impeached for them. It is an entirely subjective decision.]



“Thank you for your 9/26/19 article regarding your plan to cover the politics at play in the upcoming impeachment inquiry, in an unbiased manner. As a long time reader, I've always appreciated your fairness when reporting on events that are very charged with emotion for much of us. I am a liberal Democrat, so clearly I'm not a supporter of President Trump. So it is very easy to get drawn into the ‘echo chamber’ at times, even though I try my best to resist. Your newsletter certainly helps me to be able to appreciate the views on both sides, even if I don't agree. I look forward to your upcoming articles, during what is sure to be a very painful and frustrating period for both ‘teams.’” – Holly Stilo, Lawrenceville, Ga.



[Ed. note: Thank you so much for your kind words, Ms. Stilo. It is quite pleasant to not be a “team” player at times like this. I wish for the health of the republic and all good things for my countrymen, but we have reached a saturation point with the negative partisanship that pervades our system. It’s time for the teams to fight it out. We will be here to watch the festivities and will endeavor to keep a level head throughout.]



“…I get tired of hearing everybody blaming the current political dysfunction on Trump. They are missing the point. In 2016 the Cubs won the World Series, irreparably damaging the space-time continuum and creating chaos in the universe and calling into question the meaning of life itself. Shortly thereafter, Trump was elected President of the United States. I leave it to you: Trump or the Cubs?” – George Fuller, St. Louis



[Ed. note: Then it’s very good news that on Sunday the Cardinals closed the rift in the space-time continuum by beating the little bears and taking their rightful place atop the National League Central Division.]

DETROIT ROCK CITY

AP: “Motorists traveling through a Detroit suburb were stunned to see a pornographic video playing on an electronic billboard. Auburn Hills police say the video played on the billboard along Interstate 75 in Oakland County for about 30 minutes Saturday night before the images were removed. Many people called 911. Chuck McMahon says he saw the video and wondered if the billboard was advertising for a strip club. Investigators tell WDIV-TV that two people apparently broke into a small building at the site and loaded porn on a laptop that’s connected to the billboard. Two men wearing hooded sweatshirts were spotted on security video. Police are asking the public to help identify them. Dr. Justin Kammo also saw the video. He says he immediately assumed that ‘someone had hacked it.’”

“The New York subway is a place where the rules nominally apply, but only nominally. The problem is more than the breakdown of law. It is the breakdown of order.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in Time magazine on June 24, 2001.

Russell Bucklew was executed at the state prison in Bonne Terre for killing a man during a 1996 crime spree. It was Missouri’s first execution since January 2017.

Bucklew had twice been within hours of execution, only to have the U.S. Supreme Court grant last-minute reprieves over concerns that he might suffer during the execution process. He had a condition called cavernous hemangioma and had blood-filled tumors in his head, neck and throat. He breathed with the help from a tracheostomy tube.

Bucklew’s attorneys said in a clemency request to Gov. Mike Parson that a throat tumor could burst, causing Bucklew to choke and die painfully and in violation of the constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment.

LEGALLY HAUNTED NEW YORK HOME BACK ON THE MARKET

Adding to the concern was Missouri’s execution drug. The state uses a single dose of pentobarbital but refuses to say where it gets it from. The source is believed to be a compound pharmacy since large pharmaceutical companies prohibit the use of their drugs in executions.

The Supreme Court stepped in to halt Bucklew’s execution in 2014 and again in 2018. But in April, the high court gave the go-ahead for Bucklew to be executed.

Human rights groups and death penalty opponents, including all four Roman Catholic bishops in Missouri and the American Civil Liberties Union, urged Parson to grant clemency and remand Bucklew to life in prison without parole. The ACLU and Missourians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty presented the governor’s office on Thursday with petitions that they said included more than 57,000 signatures.

Parson, a Republican who worked in law enforcement for more than 20 years and a staunch death penalty supporter, decided early Tuesday that the execution could proceed.

Bucklew’s girlfriend, Stephanie Ray, left him on Valentine’s Day 1996. Over the next few weeks, according to court records, he harassed her, cut her with a knife and punched her in the face.

Ray feared for her life and the lives of her children, so she moved into the Cape Girardeau County mobile home that her new boyfriend, Michael Sanders, shared with his children.

On March 21, after stealing his nephew’s car and taking two pistols, handcuffs and duct tape from his brother, Bucklew followed Ray to Sanders’ home. Sanders confronted Bucklew with a shotgun inside the home. Bucklew fired two shots, one piercing Sanders’ lung. He bled to death.

Bucklew then shot at Sanders’ 6-year-old son and missed. Court records say he struck Ray in the face with the pistol, handcuffed her and dragged her to his car. He later raped Ray before heading north on Interstate 55.

A trooper spotted Bucklew’s car and eventually became engaged in a gunfight near St. Louis. Both men were wounded. Bucklew later escaped from the Cape Girardeau County Jail. He attacked Ray’s mother and her boyfriend with a hammer before being recaptured.

Bucklew’s attorneys, Cheryl Pilate and Jeremy Weis, said in a statement that Bucklew was remorseful for his crimes.

Bucklew looked around and twitched his feet beneath the sheet as he lay on the gurney just before the lethal injection. He suddenly took a deep breath and all movement stopped.

There were no outward signs of distress.

Mike Parson, who must decide if the risk posed by Russell Bucklew's unusual medical condition is grave enough to halt his execution.

Bucklew, 51, is scheduled to be put to death Tuesday evening for killing a man during a 1996 crime spree that started with his girlfriend breaking up with him on Valentine's Day.

He suffers from cavernous hemangioma. The rare disease causes blood-filled tumors in his head, neck and throat. A permanent tracheostomy in his throat helps him breathe. His attorneys say in the clemency request that if one of the throat tumors bursts, Bucklew could suffer an excruciatingly painful death.

""These unstable tumors are highly likely to hemorrhage during the stress of the execution, causing Russell to cough and choke on his own blood,"" the clemency request states.

Bucklew's girlfriend, Stephanie Ray, left him on Valentine's Day in 1996. Over the next few weeks, according to court records, he harassed her, cut her with a knife and punched her in the face. Ray feared for her life and the lives of her children, so she moved into the Cape Girardeau County mobile home that her new boyfriend, Michael Sanders, shared with his children.

A trooper spotted Bucklew's car and eventually became engaged in a gunfight near St. Louis. Both men were wounded. Bucklew later escaped from the Cape Girardeau County Jail. He attacked Ray's mother and her boyfriend with a hammer before being recaptured.

The U.S. Supreme Court in April gave the go-ahead for Bucklew to be executed, so court appeals appear to be exhausted.

The execution would be the first in Missouri since January 2017.

Missouri uses a single dose of pentobarbital as its execution drug but refuses to say where it gets it. The source is believed to be a compound pharmacy since large pharmaceutical companies prohibit the use of their drugs in executions.

It wasn't known if the Missouri Department of Corrections planned any extra precautions to address the risk that Bucklew could suffer, in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. A spokeswoman for the department said aspects of the state protocol are confidential, including what medical personnel are involved.

Bucklew was within hours of execution in 2014 and again in 2018 , only to get reprieves from the U.S. Supreme Court amid concerns about whether he might suffer.

Human rights groups and death penalty opponents, including all four Roman Catholic bishops in Missouri and the American Civil Liberties Union, have urged Parson to intervene. The ACLU and Missourians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty presented the governor's office on Thursday with petitions that they say had more than 57,000 signatures.

Shortly after the 2018 reprieve, Bucklew contracted meningitis, requiring insertion of the tracheostomy tube, said one of his attorneys, Jeremy Weis. The tube is narrow and could fill with blood if the tumors burst, Weis said.

In 2017, the execution of twice-convicted killer Alva Campbell, who suffered from smoking-related breathing problems, had to be halted in Ohio when a usable vein couldn't be found to administer execution drugs. He died in 2018 at age 69.

In 2018, Alabama halted the lethal injection of Doyle Lee Hamm when the execution team had trouble getting the intravenous line connected. Hamm had damaged veins because of lymphoma, hepatitis and drug use.

A doctor hired by Hamm's lawyers wrote in a report that Hamm had at least 11 puncture sites and bled heavily from his groin during the attempts to connect the line.

Acosta has emerged as a hero among progressives for digging in on Trump and members of his administration when they’re available to the press.

Last year, Acosta was briefly banned from the White House after he engaged in a contentious back-and-forth with Trump during a Nov. 7 press conference. During a now-infamous moment, Acosta refused to pass the microphone to a White House aide.

To coincide with Acosta being allowed to return to the White House, then-Press Secretary Sarah Sanders implemented a series of rules to govern White House press conferences going forward.

The Blue Bowl, a charity flag football game, was intended to raise money for the family of fallen Ventura County Sgt. Ron Helus as well as other officers killed in the line of duty, FOX 11 of Los Angeles reported.

Helus died last Nov. 7, when a 28-year-old suspect allegedly attacked the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, killing a total of 13 people and wounding about a dozen others. The suspect died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities have said.

Thousands of dollars had already been raised for fallen officers' families, but the money is now being returned to donors because Thousand Oaks Police Chief Tim Hagel reportedly withdrew the police department because Trump supporters would be speaking at the event.

HANNITY: DEMS WANT TO IMPEACH TRUMP BECAUSE THEY'RE 'HELL-BENT ON TAKING REVENGE' FOR 2016 DEFEAT

'Wow, are you kidding me?'

""He basically said over and over in the conversation, 'This is not Trump country, that slogan 'Make America Great' is not favorable, popular, within 1,200 square miles,' that we don’t want Republicans here. I could not believe it,” Mike Randall, vice president of the Fallen Officers Foundation, said, according to FOX 11.

“'The only thing,' and I quote, 'the only thing you [could have done to make] this worse, Mike, was to invite Dick Cheney and Sarah Huckabee Sanders.'

""And I went, 'Wow, are you kidding me?""

Both Democrats and Republicans were invited to the event. Gov. Gavin Newsom's public safety liaison, Trump supporter Scott Baio, who attended Helus’ church, and Trump-supporting singer Joy Villa were all scheduled to attend.

He also said Democratic Assemblywoman Jacqui Irwin was upset that her former opponent had been invited.

He added that Hagel told him to get rid of the Republican speakers or the police department would withdraw. They finally did pull out.

""He goes, 'Yeah, this ain’t gonna work for us,' I said, 'You’re not gonna support this with the honor guard?' And he goes, 'No, we’re not bringing the honor guard. We’re not coming. We’re not going to be there, not supporting it',"" said Randall.

'This is not OK. This is prejudice.'

The Ventura County Sheriff’s Department issued a statement, saying:



""The 'Blue Bowl' event was represented as a charitable flag football tournament to raise funds for the family of Sergeant Ron Helus. An event that would honor Ron’s memory and provide support to his wife Karen and son Jordan. As the event began to materialize, we became concerned with the behavior of some of the organizers of the event. Although I believe the organizers had good intentions, the event was moving in a direction we no longer felt comfortable supporting.”

Singer Villa called the chief's response ""disgusting.""

""This is not OK. This is prejudice, hello?"" she said. ""You’re shutting down an event because of the way conservatives think, because I support the president? This is disgusting, I’m appalled, and in all my years being an out conservative, I’ve never seen something so despicable like this.”

The Washington Mystics hope to have Elena Delle Donne back for both of them.

Jonquel Jones scored 32 points and grabbed 18 rebounds, and the Sun took advantage of Delle Donne's early injury exit to beat the Mystics 99-87 in Game 2 of the WNBA Finals on Tuesday night and even the series.

""This was our goal, to steal a win on their floor,"" said Sun guard Jasmine Thomas. ""And now we get to go home and play two in a row.""

Alyssa Thomas added 21 points and 12 rebounds, and Courtney Williams had 22 points for the Sun, who dominated the paint after the 6-foot-5 Delle Donne departed in the first quarter with back spasms.

The recently crowned league MVP, who averaged 19.5 points and 8.2 rebounds this season, will have an MRI Wednesday.

""She's just had, kind of ongoing, late-in-the-season tightness,"" said Mystics coach Mike Thibault. ""We've been able to treat it and it's responded pretty well. But it's the one nightmare I've had the last month, is seeing her lying on her back.""

Connecticut outrebounded Washington 41-27 overall and 17-6 on the offensive glass. Jones, who didn't have an offensive board in the first game, had a WNBA Finals record nine. She also only took eight shots in the series opener, which Connecticut lost 95-86.

""I was disappointed in Game 1,"" said Jones, who had the most points in the finals since 2011 when Angel McCoughtry had 38 and Seimone Augustus 36. ""Disappointed with my lack of getting offensive boards, I had to make a change.""

In Game 2, Emma Meeseman scored 22 points off the bench for Washington after spelling Delle Donne early in the first quarter and Tianna Hawkins added 16. Washington's bench outscored Connecticut's 52-9.

Kristi Toliver was the Mystics' only starter in double figures with 13 points. Delle Donne finished scoreless after taking just two early shots.

""She's such a big part of what they do. You don't want to wish injury on anyone, but we knew it was a chance to steal one here,"" Jones said.

Even so, after Connecticut led by as many as 14 points in the second quarter, the Mystics fought back from a 10-point halftime deficit to tie it briefly.

Aerial Powers converted a three-point play before adding a slashing layup on Toliver's feed to cut it to 71-69 late in the third to complete a 7-0 run. Toliver's runner evened it at 76-all with 8:14 left in the game.

The Sun responded with a 6-0 spurt to take the lead for good. Jones hit a putback before Williams added a pair of inside buckets, the latter after two offensive rebounds from Jones, to make it 82-76.

""J.J. was going crazy today,"" Williams said. ""I told her I felt like I could put up the ball from half court and she was going to look out for me and get the rebound.""

EVERY MINUTE COUNTS

Thomas has now played all 40 minutes of the series. Her average of 36 minutes this postseason leads all players who have played in multiple playoff games.

""She just is so important to us,"" explained coach Curt Miller. ""She anchors our defense. ... I don't think there's a better defender in the league.""

FIRST HALF FOLLEY

Thibault thought his team eventually reacted well to Delle Donne's departure, but only allowing the Sun a 12-2 run in the first quarter and another 11-0 stretch in the second.

""I thought we got deflated when Elena went out,"" Thibault said. ""It took us too long to recover from that and say, 'OK, we can still win this.'""

TIP-INS

Sun: Jones passed her Game 1 scoring total of 12 points when she hit a layup 4:25 left in the first half to reach 14. She had 18 points and 10 rebounds by halftime. ... G Layshia Clarendon (right ankle) did not play after Miller said Monday she was questionable for the game. She hasn't seen game action since June 16.

Mystics: Delle Donne also missed the teams' first regular season meeting in 2019 with knee soreness, an 84-69 Sun victory on May 25. ... C LaToya Sanders picked up a technical for a defensive 3-second violation with 39 seconds left in the first half, and Hawkins committed the same offense midway through the third quarter.

The former vice president has 37% support, followed by Elizabeth Warren at 17%. Bernie Sanders is third with 8%, followed by Kamala Harris at 7%.

* Speaking of the Palmetto State, some South Carolina Republicans, including former Rep. Bob Inglis, sued the state Republican Party this week “over its decision to cancel its GOP presidential primary next year.”

* As difficult as this may seem to believe, Andrew Yang, a Democratic presidential candidate running for elected office for the first time, raised $10 million in the third quarter. That’s “more than triple the $2.8 million Yang raised in the second quarter.”

* Kamala Harris, meanwhile, raised $11.6 million between July and September, which is awfully close to the $11.8 million she raised in the second quarter.

* Former Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), whose 2020 presidential campaign has struggled to gain traction, has reportedly lost four key aides, including his state directors in Iowa and New Hampshire.

* Joe Biden’s campaign released a new plan on gun policy today, which includes an assault-weapons ban. Under the blueprint, those Americans who already own assault weapons would be required to either register the weapons or sell them to the government.

* Speaking of new 2020 plans, Elizabeth Warren’s campaign unveiled a new proposal this morning that would tax lobbying: “Under her proposal, companies that spend between $500,000 and $1 million a year on lobbying would pay a 35% tax on their expenditures. The rate would increase to 60% for spending of more than $1 million, and to 75% above $5 million.”

* And finally, Donald Trump last week told a rather detailed story about CNN building a multi-million-dollar studio in North Carolina’s 9th congressional district, which he said the network intended to keep up “for weeks” if the Democratic candidate won in a recent special election. Like so many of the president’s bizarre anecdotes, the story was completely made up and had no basis in reality."

* Much of the Democrats’ 2020 field participated in an MSNBC policy forum yesterday on addressing gun violence. NBC published a live-blog of the event.

* The lineup and podium order for the next Democratic presidential primary debate was announced yesterday, and it will be a one-night, 12-candidate event.

* With only a month remaining ahead of Louisiana’s gubernatorial race, Trump is urging his followers in the state to support either Eddie Rispone (R) or Ralph Abraham (R), one of whom is likely to advance to a probable runoff against incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards (D).

* Similarly, with time running out in Mississippi’s gubernatorial race, the president is throwing his support behind Tate Reeves’ (R) candidacy, arguing yesterday that his rival, state Attorney General Jim Hood (D), is “pro-Crooked Hillary.” In case anyone’s curious, the 2016 election was 1,058 days ago."

Bernie Sanders is off the campaign trail as the Democratic presidential candidate recovers from a procedure to clear a clogged artery – but the independent senator from Vermont’s campaign confirmed to Fox News on Thursday that Sanders will take the stage at the upcoming Oct. 15 presidential primary date.

The 78-year-old Sanders’ appearance at the fourth round debate was in question after top aides announced on Wednesday that the White House contender underwent a heart procedure a day earlier after experiencing chest discomfort a day earlier during a campaign event.

12 TO FACE OFF: STAGE SET FOR RECORD-SETTING DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY DEBATE

The campaign said on Wednesday that Sanders would stay off the campaign trail “until further notice.”

But the candidate's wife Jane Sanders highlighted in a statement on Thursday that ""we expect Bernie will be discharged and on a plane back to Burlington before the end of the weekend. He'll take a few days to rest, but he's ready to get back out there and is looking forward to the October debate.”

She noted that ""Bernie is up and about. Yesterday, he spent much of the day talking with staff about policies, cracking jokes with the nurses and doctors, and speaking with his family on the phone. His doctors are pleased with his progress, and there has been no need for any additional procedures.""

Twelve candidates have qualified for the Oct. 15 debate, which will be held at Otterbein University, a liberal arts institution in Westerville, Ohio. The Democratic National Committee’s media partners for the showdown are CNN and The New York Times.

Sanders officials confirmed to Fox News on Wednesday that they’ve postponed running their first TV commercial of the campaign. The spot in Iowa was supposed to hit airwaves in the first caucus state starting on Thursday. The campaign announced the $1.3 million ad buy earlier in the week.

TRUMP BACKERS TORMENT WARREN IN NEVADA

A series of polls released this week shows Warren leading Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden both among national voters and in early primary and caucus states.

BERNIE SANDERS HAS STENTS INSERTED AFTER DOCTORS FIND BLOCKAGE

Sanders took a break from the trail this week after he ended up in the hospital with heart complications and underwent an emergency procedure Tuesday to repair a blocked artery, according to his campaign.

""We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates,"" Sanders' campaign said in a statement.

Varney argued that Sanders' hospital visit lends credence to those questioning whether his age will get in the way of securing a spot in the Oval Office.

WARREN CONTINUES ATTACK ON FACEBOOK AFTER ZUCKERBERG REVEALS IT WOULD SUE GOVERNMENT IF SHE BECOMES PRESIDENT

""There are now obvious questions about whether a 78-year-old can endure months of exhausting campaigning,"" he said.

Varney then turned to Biden, who has come under fire since the launch of a formal impeachment investigation against President Trump over the content of a phone call during which Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about Biden and son Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine.

""He is a casualty of the impeachment, he is collateral damage,"" said Varney. ""All the attention given to the Ukraine call has brought back the question about Hunter Biden, and the money he received in Ukraine and China.""

""It all happened so quickly,"" he continued, ""but as of now, it's Elizabeth Warren's nomination to lose.""

However, Varney said he didn't think Warren could win the general election in November 2020 ""for two reasons.""

""I don't think Americans will elect as president someone who wants to destroy our economic system,"" he said. ""Elizabeth Warren is a socialist. Her proposals would destroy capitalism, and with it, the prosperity we enjoy today.""

VARNEY: HONG KONG ENGAGED IN URBAN WARFARE

Varney said the second reason was due to Warren's ""demeanor,""

""Anger is Senator Warren's frequent theme, hating capitalism, the rich, the billionaires, Wall Street -- that plays well to socialists, but on your screens, every day for four years, anger is not so attractive,"" he said. ""... You've got to be good on TV to win these days.""

Varney also issued a warning to Democrats, saying they should be ""very worried,"" should ""far-left"" Warren win the nomination.

""Far-left Warren is now very likely to be the nominee and outside of California and New York, Democrats should be very worried,"" he concluded.

WARREN EDGES BIDEN, SANDERS SLIPS, IN NEW NH PRIMARY POLL

""We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates,"" Sanders' campaign said in a statement.

Sanders himself took to Twitter in the afternoon to reassure his followers that he was on the mend and to do some campaigning for his push for universal healthcare.

""Thanks for all the well wishes,"" Sanders tweeted. ""I'm feeling good. I'm fortunate to have good health care and great doctors and nurses helping me to recover.""

He added: ""None of us know when a medical emergency might affect us. And no one should fear going bankrupt if it occurs. Medicare for All!""

The Vermont senator began to experience some chest discomfort during an event on Tuesday evening in Nevada and was taken to the hospital for a medical evaluation and treatment, where it was discovered that he had a blocked artery.

The Sanders campaign also confirmed to Fox News that they’re postponing a $1.3 million TV ad buy in Iowa that was supposed to hit airwaves in the first caucus state starting on Thursday. The campaign announced the ad just one day ago.

But a senior campaign official told Fox News that overall, “campaign operations are continuing as usual” while the senator is sidelined.

The 78-year-old Sanders, the Democratic field's oldest candidate, sometimes jokingly refers to his age at town halls and other events, especially when interacting with younger participants.

Sanders is one of the leaders in a crowded field vying to be the party's 2020 presidential nominee and take on President Trump in the general election.

His campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, was on a telephone call with supporters Tuesday night but didn’t mention any health concerns about the candidate. Shakir said the “state of the campaign is strong” and he played up Sanders’ strong fundraising total for the third quarter.

Sanders recently canceled some appearances in South Carolina because he lost his voice. The campaign said at the time he felt fine.

Biden’s haul is a drop of more than $6 million from the $21.5 million he raised in the April-June second quarter of fundraising, and is far behind the $25.3 million that nomination rival Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont brought in the past three months. It’s also less than the $19.1 million that South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg raised in the third quarter.

SANDERS HAULS IN AN EYE-POPPING $25.3 MILLION IN THIRD QUARTER

Highlighting the numbers, Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz noted that “today’s fundraising totals put the campaign in a strong position as we enter the fall. The question any campaign faces at this point is whether or not you have the resources to compete in early states and sustain your efforts beyond. Our campaign unequivocally does, and builds on our strength each week.”

The Biden camp emphasized that 98 percent of all donations were from grassroots donors giving $200 or less, and that 56 percent of contributors in the past three months were new to the campaign.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California reported bringing in $11.6 million in the third quarter, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang hauling in $10 million, triple what he raised in the second quarter. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey announced he raised over $6 million.

Best-selling spiritual author Marianne Williamson said she raised over $3 million and Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado reported raising $2.1 million.

Among those yet to report third-quarter fundraising figures is Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is tied with Biden for the lead position in most the recent national and early-voting-state Democratic nomination polls.

President Trump’s reelection team announced that it and the Republican National Committee combined had brought in a massive $125 million in the third quarter.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Tuesday was the first day campaigns could announce their third-quarter numbers, but they have until Oct. 15 to officially file their fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission.

Campaign cash is a crucial barometer of a candidate’s appeal and popularity and of his or her campaign’s strength. The third-quarter fundraising figures of the Democratic presidential candidates will be heavily analyzed and scrutinized. Fundraising dollars can be used by the candidates to pay for campaign staff and grassroots outreach efforts, travel, and ads."

Biden’s campaign announced that it's reserving “prime advertising space on traditional television and on digital platforms like YouTube, Hulu and news and sports streaming services” in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, the first four states on the presidential nominating calendar.

WARREN SHOWCASES $10 MILLION AD BUY IN EARLY VOTING STATES

The move comes a week after Warren’s campaign said it would dish out at least $10 million to run digital and TV spots in the same four crucial states.

Warren and Biden are virtually tied for the top spot in most recent national and early-voting-state polls.

While the Biden campaign is already running digital ads across the country and has spent six figures to run TV commercials in Iowa, this is its first major multi-state ad buy.

“We’ve been up on the airwaves in Iowa and blown away by the reaction we’ve seen to Vice President Biden’s deeply personal ad about health care,” Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz said in a statement.

“Not a day goes by that we don't get a call from somebody wanting us to attend a function or two or trying to become involved in our [community],” said Melendez.

The strategy could pay off. While the Native American population in the country remains relatively small, at about 1.5 percent of the general population, they make up a sizable portion of eligible voters in several states or districts, according to data from the National Congress of American Indians, or NCAI. The numbers continue to grow.

ELIZABETH WARREN REVISITS DNA TEST APOLOGIZES TO NATIVE AMERICANS

“[The population] has grown 27 percent since the year 2000. We're a younger crowd that is getting more visible, more educated, more active,” said Kevin Allis, CEO of NCAI.

As more Native Americans gain access to the polls, the voting bloc, which has previously complained about being overlooked, could be pivotal in key primary states like Iowa, Arizona, and Nevada. The latter two states have relatively large Native populations (Nevada has 27 federally recognized tribes) that could make a significant difference.

During the 2016 Iowa caucuses, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., reportedly earned 83.3 percent of the Indian Settlement precinct votes after visiting the Meskwaki settlement. He has credited those votes for helping him almost beat U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: WE NEED AN ECONOMY AND GOVERNMENT THAT WORKS FOR ALL, NOT JUST THE 1 PERCENT

“From top to bottom, in all the different elections, you can see where the margins are that thin. We really have an opportunity to make a difference,” Allis said.

To improve turnout, many Native American voting activists have called for better access to the polls. They say the issue is most pressing in rural areas where some tribal lands may be more than a hundred miles away from a polling location.

“I think Native Americans sometimes are reluctant to go to try to find where the voting site is in the city. But if we can bring those voting sites out to reservation lands, I think we'll have a better turnout,” said Melendez.

Some of the main issues for Indian country include climate change and addressing the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women. But, above all, they’ve called for the federal government to honor the agreements laid out in treaties with Native American nations.

“Native Americans have given up millions of acres of land in exchange for those promises of health care, of law enforcement, all those different governmental needs that we have,” said Melendez.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro have rolled out policy proposals targeting Native Americans. They touched on some of those plans in August during the Frank LaMere Native American Presidential Forum in Sioux City, Iowa, which was organized by the non-profit organization, Four Directions Inc., and considered the first forum in history to exclusively cover Native American issues.

There, Warren apologized for her highly criticized use of a DNA test to prove her Native American ancestry. Her proposal was largely seen as an attempt to soften the blowback from the controversy, which angered many Native Americans and continues to haunt her campaign.

“We really have an opportunity to make a difference, and the candidates are running for office really need to understand that those numbers matter and can win or lose a particular election,” he said.

SANDERS UPS ANTE WITH HIGHER WEALTH TAX PROPOSAL THAN WARREN’S: ‘BILLIONAIRES SHOULD NOT EXIST’

Moore, who helped write the 2017 tax cuts, cited a report from the Census Bureau and said: “Since Donald Trump was elected and took office through July of 2019, median family incomes, middle-class incomes are up $4,100.”

""In the entire eight years that Obama was president, incomes only budged up about $1,000, so in one-third of the time, Trump has increased income by four times as much. We now have a median income of 65,000 dollars. That shows pretty clearly that the middle-class has been benefiting,” he added.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

In his decades in Congress and during both of his runs for the White House, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has railed against an American economic system that he says favors corporations and the rich, at the expense of the working class.

The release of the independent senator from Vermont's ‘Tax on Extreme Wealth’ follows a similar plan from one of his top rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination, fellow progressive and populist lawmaker Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

The Sanders campaign says their plan would impact approximately 180,000 households nationwide and would raise about $4.35 trillion in government revenue by the 2028 budget year.

Moore argued that Democrats are going to have a hard time proving to Americans that their economic policies will be better.

“If these numbers hold up, it’s going to be difficult for any Democrat to beat Donald Trump because he’s proven to be the blue-collar president,” Moore said.

He acknowledged, however, that there was a poor report Tuesday on U.S. manufacturing and exports.

The ISM September Manufacturing Index slipped to 47.8, down 1.3 percentage points from August. A read below 50 signals contraction. More worrisome is new export orders, which hit 41 percent, a 2.3 percentage point drop from last month.

SANDERS OFF THE TRAIL WITH HEART PROBLEMS

AP: “Bernie Sanders’ campaign says the Democratic presidential candidate has had a heart procedure for a blocked artery. The Vermont senator is canceling events and appearances ‘until further notice.’ The campaign says the 78-year-old Sanders experienced chest discomfort during an event Tuesday and sought medical evaluation. The campaign says two stents were ‘successfully inserted’ and that Sanders ‘is conversing and in good spirits.’ His campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, was on a telephone call with supporters Tuesday night but didn’t mention any health concerns about the candidate. Shakir said the ‘state of the campaign is strong’ and he played up Sanders’ strong fundraising total for the third quarter. Sanders recently canceled some appearances in South Carolina because he lost his voice. The campaign said at the time he felt fine.”



Biden still strong in South Carolina - Greenville [S.C.] News: “The latest Winthrop Poll results are out and South Carolina democratic voters strongly support former Vice President Joe Biden for the presidency, according to the results. Biden drew 37% of the votes among those surveyed. Among African American democrats and democratic-leaning African Americans, Biden earned 46% of the votes, according to the poll. This is the first Winthrop Poll looking at the 2020 primary candidates. Sen. Elizabeth Warren earned 17%, Sen. Bernie Sanders 8%, Sen. Kamala Harris 7% and the remaining 15 candidates each earned less than 5% support in the poll. … The Winthrop Poll is among the list of qualifying polls [for debate qualifications]. Of the remaining 15 candidates, only South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Cory Booker earned at least 3% approval.”



Warren, Biden neck in neck in New Hampshire - WMUR: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren is now in a virtual dead heat with former Vice President Joe Biden in the first-in-the-nation Democratic presidential primary campaign, according to a new poll. The latest Saint Anselm College Center Survey Center poll shows that Warren’s overall upward trajectory is evident in New Hampshire, as it has been recently in national polls. … Sen. Bernie Sanders, the landslide winner of the 2016 Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire, is in third place with 11 percent, essentially tied with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who was backed by 10 percent of those polled. … Sen. Kamala Harris was the top choice of 5 percent, while U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Sen. Amy Klobuchar received 3 percent each. Philanthropist/activist Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang each received support from 2 percent of those polled, while Sen. Cory Booker was backed by 1 percent.”



Yang brings in big bucks with free money plan - Axios: “2020 candidate Andrew Yang's campaign says it raised $10 million in 2019's third quarter, according to Politico. Why it matters: Yang's Q3 report is more than triple the $2.8 million he raised in the second quarter — a push powered by some strong debate performances that elevated his national profile. The state of play: Yang outpaced Sen. Cory Booker’s $6 million and came close to Sen. Kamala Harris’ $11.6 million. … Yang's campaign said nearly 300,000 people have donated — almost double the threshold required to qualify for the November debate. … Yang's campaign told Politico that it received $1 million in the 72 hours after the September debate in which he announced that he was giving away $120,000 to 10 families over a year to promote signature campaign proposal: universal basic income, branded by Yang as the ‘freedom dividend.’”



HUGE CASH HAUL FOR TRUMP

AP: “President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee raised $125 million in the third quarter of the year, a presidential fundraising record. The pro-Trump effort said Tuesday that it has raised more than $308 million in 2019 and has more than $156 million in the bank. Republicans aim to use the fundraising haul to fight off Democrats’ impeachment effort. Former President Barack Obama and the DNC raised just over $70 million in the third quarter of 2011. ‘President Trump has built a juggernaut of a campaign, raising record amounts of money at a record pace,’ said Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale. RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel credited Democratic attacks on Trump for motivating supporters to donate in record numbers.”



GOP moves to stifle dissent in Charlotte - NYT: “President Trump’s political advisers have concluded a monthslong effort to tighten the rules for choosing delegates to the Republican National Convention, all but ensuring there are no dissenting speeches at the gathering of party officials in Charlotte next year. On Tuesday, state Republican parties submitted to the national committee their delegate allocation plans, the methods by which they will choose and bind delegates who attend the convention as their representatives. In 37 states and territories, there have been changes to the rules that will all but stamp out the possibility of any raucous divide on the convention floor. … The new delegate guidelines are the culmination of a 10-month effort by Trump advisers to strengthen the president’s grip on the Republican Party ahead of the general election. It means that even if the three candidates challenging Mr. Trump in the Republican primary gain vote shares, they almost certainly won’t translate into speeches or jeers from supporters of these candidates when the convention is taking place.”



South Carolina Republicans sue over nixed primary - The [Charleston, S.C.] Post and Courier: “Two Republicans, one of them former congressman Bob Inglis, have sued the S.C. Republican Party over its decision to cancel its GOP presidential primary next year. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in state court in Richland County, alleges the party scrapped its 2020 election contest illegally and violated party rules and state election law. The suit further contends the near-unanimous decision made by the party’s Executive Committee deprives Inglis, of Greenville, and fellow plaintiff Frank Heindel of Mount Pleasant, of their right to vote for the candidate of their choosing in a primary. … The suit comes after the Executive Committee met Sept. 7 in Columbia and voted to forgo a presidential primary. The move effectively cleared the way for Republican incumbent President Donald Trump to receive all of the state’s nominating delegates without contest.”



THE RULEBOOK: POPULISM 101

“By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 10



TIME OUT: WHAT A BUNCH OF CRETANS

NatGeo: “Deep inside the Labyrinth on the island of Crete lived a Minotaur, a monster half man, half bull. … The story of the Minotaur has thrilled people for thousands of years and inspired myriad works of art: pottery, poetry, plays, the art of Picasso, operas, movies, and video games. Although the myth can be enjoyed as a satisfying tale, archaeologists now know that its fabulous qualities have roots deep in real events in the Bronze Age. The bull-headed man in Minos’s maze embodies several traits found in the culture of Crete and ancient Minoan civilization. Bulls and maze motifs are found throughout Minoan culture, which dominated the Mediterranean from about 3000 B.C. to about 1100 B.C. In confronting and overcoming the bull—a symbol of Crete—Theseus, the legendary founder of Athens, reflects the flowering of Aegean civilizations beginning in the middle of the second millennium B.C., as mainland Greece replaced Crete as the dominant power.”

TRUMP’S TEAM EMBRACES ‘COUP’ CLAIM

Mediaite: “President Donald Trump decried the House of Representatives’ impeachment inquiry as a ‘coup,’ and it looks like his campaign is embracing that rhetoric to blast Democrats. Trump echoed similar comments made on Fox News in the past few days, including from trade advisor Peter Navarro this week. And now Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted this afternoon Democrats should be working on policies ‘that help America instead of trying to overthrow our government with a coup’ And the Trump campaign has a new ad out today — called ‘Coup’ — accusing Democrats of orchestrating ‘nothing short of a coup’ against the president.”



Senate GOP could take up impeachment only to drop it - NYT: “Senator Mitch McConnell’s comment this week that the Senate would be forced to ‘take up’ articles of impeachment from the House had the capital in a swirl, bracing for a full-blown Senate trial of President Trump. But as things now stand, any trial would likely be swift, ending in dismissal of the accusations. While the focus was on the statement by Mr. McConnell, the majority leader, that the Senate would have ‘no choice’ but to begin an impeachment proceeding, it was his next line that might have been more telling: ‘How long you are on it is a whole different matter.’ The fusty rules of the Senate make clear that Republicans could not unilaterally stonewall articles of impeachment of Mr. Trump as they did the Supreme Court nomination of Merrick B. Garland. But Mr. McConnell’s declaration suggests the Republican-controlled Senate could move expeditiously to toss them out if Republicans conclude the House impeachment is meritless, or a strictly partisan affair.”



Steyer PAC spends big to target Republican senators on impeachment - WaPo: “A group pushing for the impeachment of President Trump is launching a $3.1 million ad campaign targeting Republican senators over the coming weeks as pro-impeachment activists turn their fire away from Democratic holdouts and toward members of the president’s own party. The group, Need to Impeach, is funded mainly by billionaire Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer. Top executives said Tuesday that more than half of the ad campaign money will go toward television spots, with the rest underwriting digital ads. The campaign will focus on Republican Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Cory Gardner (Colo.) and Martha McSally (Ariz.), all of whom are seeking reelection next year and could cast votes in the coming months on whether Trump should be removed from office.”



Cheney sends House Republicans home with talking points - WashEx: “Republican leaders in the House of Representatives sent the rank-and-file home with one overriding message to deliver to voters in their districts: There is no evidence that warrants an impeachment inquiry into President Trump. The bulleted talking points, prepared by Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, also attack House Democrats as disorganized and the impeachment process as illegitimate, primarily because Nancy Pelosi declined to hold a floor vote on whether to open the inquiry. Cheney argues in her messaging guidance that Democrats have been intent on impeaching Trump for more than two years. An investigation into Trump's harmless telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, she asserts, is just the Democrats' latest excuse to justify their attempt to undo the 2016 election.”



PETE SESSIONS GOES DISTRICT SHOPPING

Texas Tribune: “Former Republican U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions appears poised to make a comeback attempt — but not in his old Dallas-based district. Sessions, who lost reelection last year, plans to announce Thursday he's running for the seat being vacated by retiring U.S. Rep. Bill Flores, according to McLennan County GOP Chairman Jon R. Ker. The announcement will be at the county party headquarters in Waco, added Ker, who said he spoke with Sessions on Tuesday. Sessions' anticipated run is a surprise development after he spent months publicly flirting with running for his previous 32nd District seat, which is about 80 miles north of Flores' more Republican 17th District. The initial reaction ‘has not been positive,’ Flores told The Texas Tribune late Tuesday. ‘Pete is a friend of mine, but I wish he'd called me first,’ said Flores, R-Bryan. ‘I could have provided some valuable feedback to him.’”



Tenney signs up for rematch to reclaim seat - Roll Call: “Former Rep. Claudia Tenney, one of President Donald Trump’s most vocal supporters last Congress, announced Tuesday she will run for her old seat in New York’s 22nd District. Tenney lost by less than 2 percentage points in the 2018 midterms to Democratic Rep. Anthony Brindisi despite running one of the most pro-Trump campaigns of any vulnerable House Republican. The president carried New York’s 22nd District by 15 percentage points in 2016. ‘Upstate New York deserves a representative who will fight for their values in Congress, someone who will work to deliver actual results, not resistance,’ Tenney said in a press release Tuesday.”



Lewandowski shies from Senate run - Politico: “Corey Lewandowski told a local radio host Tuesday ‘it’s fair’ to say he is reconsidering a Senate run in order to defend President Donald Trump from impeachment and help him get reelected. ‘As much as I think I would be a great fighter for the people of New Hampshire, and one U.S. senator can make a difference, it is my priority to make sure the president of United States is reelected,’ Lewandowski said on the radio show, ‘New Hampshire Today with Jack Heath.’ ‘That's a top priority.’ The president's brash and outspoken former campaign manager would have to go up against three other Republicans looking to unseat Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.”

“You don't really want to identify with anybody on that show. The only character with any kind of moral purity to them is Gary, the body guy. But it's not like you really want to be him.” – Mayor Pete Buttigieg when asked which character from HBO’s Veep he relate most to during an interview with the Hollywood Reporter.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Just curious about the railroad spike on the trophy plaque behind you.” – Martin Jarvis, Wright City, Mo.



[Ed. note: Now that’s what I call observant viewership, Mr. Jarvis! Other viewers of our show on Fox Nation may have seen that simple wooden board with a rusty railroad spike behind me. It is from the Monongha Mine in Marion County, W.Va., the scene of the worst mine disaster in American history. On Dec. 6, 1907 at least 362 men were killed when the poorly-ventilated mine filled with methane gas, which exploded with terrible force, killing almost all instantly. Any effort to evacuate the mine would have been badly complicated by a language barrier. The lion’s share of the miners were Italian immigrants, but there would have been Hungarians, Czechs and other non-English speakers working in crews of their own, making it hard for English-speaking foremen to direct an escape as the inferno spread from section to section. The blast collapsed much of the roof and destroyed the rail lines in and out of the mine. That spike came from one of those shattered rail ties and was given long ago to my father, a coal salesman, by a West Virginia coal operator whose own father had saved it after the explosion. I love the way it looks and it goes along with some other ancient mine memorabilia in my office, including a carbide lamp miner’s helmet. But I also love it as a memento of how much I have to be thankful for. My work here in this comfortable, air-conditioned office is safe, well-compensated and personally rewarding. It’s a far cry from the coal pits where so many men toiled and sometimes died. That little spike reminds me of who I am, where I’m from, my dear old dad and, most of all, to be grateful.]

DANA PERINO WANTED FOR QUESTIONING

CBS12: “A man in Fort Lauderdale is accused of tampering with dozens of electric scooters. Authorities have been investigating the vandalism of more than 140 scooters since April. One incident is caught on surveillance video, which police released to the public in an effort to identify a suspect. The investigation led to the arrest of 59-year-old Randall Thomas Williams. Police said they found 20 scooters nearby with severed brake lines. Police say Williams is the one who cut the brake lines on the scooters. He faces criminal mischief charges. Investigators have not revealed a motive. Police are asking anyone who finds an electric scooter that appears to have been tampered with to contact the vendor.”

53,Andrew O'Reilly,"President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order giving a broader role to Medicare's private insurance option – as he vowed to protect the current system from Democratic presidential candidates' calls to enact “Medicare-for-all.”

Medicare itself remains popular, but the calls to enact a single-payer, government-run system for everyone are far more controversial. Signing the order at the Villages – a retirement community north of Orlando – Trump singled out Democrats he said want to “totally obliterate Medicare.”

“They want to raid Medicare to fund the idea of socialism,” Trump said. “All of the Democrats' plans would totally devastate our health care plans.”

Trump added, “Democratic health care proposals would put everyone into a single-payer, socialist government-run plan.”

‘MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' SPONSOR SAYS PLAN WOULD GUT 1 MILLION PRIVATE INSURANCE JOBS

The president’s criticism of the Democrats' plan was squarely aimed at the Medicare-for-all proposals of candidates like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

Sanders’ “single-payer” approach would cover people of any age and would incorporate the Medicare program. Private health insurance, including the Medicare Advantage option used by about one-third of seniors, would no longer have a role.

Medicare Advantage, the private insurance option under Medicare, offers savings on premiums and an annual limit on out-of-pocket costs. They provide one-stop shopping, eliminating the need for separate supplemental insurance. Offered by major insurers, the plans also cover prescription drugs in most cases.

But there are trade-offs. Seniors joining a Medicare Advantage plan generally must accept limits on their choice of hospitals and doctors as well as prior insurer approval for certain procedures. If they change their minds and decide to return to traditional Medicare, they’re not always guaranteed supplemental “Medigap” coverage, which is also private.

Trump’s order directs his department to examine whether its current policies and practices put traditional Medicare ahead of the private Medicare Advantage option.

The order would seek to expand the range of additional services that can be offered by the private plans and would direct regulators to find more ways for seniors to financially benefit from plans that provide cost-efficient service.

FELLOW 2020 CANDIDATE CALLS BERNIE'S 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' PLAN A 'LOSING BATTLE' THAT WILL SET COUNTRY BACK 10 YEARS

Many Medicare Advantage insurers offer some dental and vision coverage, along with basics like transportation to medical appointments. But the industry lately has started to experiment with in-home assistance, including nutritious meals and financial help with safety-related home improvements.

Sanders, who underwent a heart procedure this week, has argued that Medicare-for-all would offer seniors broader benefits and lower costs. In a tweet on Wednesday, Sanders reiterated the support for his proposal and added that “no one should fear going bankrupt” because of a hospital trip.

""None of us know when a medical emergency might affect us. And no one should fear going bankrupt if it occurs. Medicare for All!""

Trump also took time during his speech to slam Democrats for opening an impeachment inquiry over a phone call the president had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July. In it, he asked Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s family’s dealings in the country.

“It’s corruption going on right now,” Trump said, calling congressional leaders “Do Nothing Dems” and the inquiry ""a hoax.""

That’s more than triple the $2.8 million the tech-entrepreneur raised during the April-June second quarter of fundraising and more evidence – along with his rise in public opinion polling – that the long-shot for the White House has surged over the summer.

YANG TELLS FOX NEWS 'I WOULD NEVER WISH FOR' A RECESSION

Yang’s campaign also reported $6.3 million cash on hand as of the end of September and noted that the funds will go towards building up staff and infrastructure in the early voting primary and caucus states.

""Andrew Yang is the only contender showing exponential growth in the third quarter, more than tripling his fundraising number from last quarter,"" campaign manager Zach Graumann touted. ""This grassroots fundraising total, with over $6m in the bank, ensures this campaign will have the funding to compete and outperform expectations through Super Tuesday and beyond.""

Yang has become a serious contender for the Democratic nomination thanks to the popularity of his so-called ""Freedom Dividend."" That’s Yang’s universal basic income proposal to give each adult American $1,000 a month to ease the economic pain stemming from lost jobs due to automation and artificial intelligence. He says he’ll pay for the program by implementing a national value-added tax.

YANG'S CAMPAIGN CASH GIVEAWAYS RAISE LEGAL CONCERNS

He's also built a strong and devout base of grassroots supporters and donors, known as the Yang Gang. Thanks to his fundraising prowess and polling, Yang has made the stage for all the Democratic primary debates to date, something that some better-known governors and senators failed to do.

Yang closed out the third quarter of fundraising by headlining a rally in Los Angeles that drew some 5,000 people, according to his campaign. And they noted that Yang raised $2.28 million in the last ten days of September.

""Wow, we ended the quarter on the biggest rush of donations ever!"" Yang tweeted on Tuesday night. ""Thank you to everyone who worked your heart out to exceed our goal - you all are amazing!""

SANDERS HAULS IN A WHOPPING $25.3 MILLION IN THIRD QUARTER

The campaign cash figure from Yang, while impressive, paled in comparison to the whopping $25.3 million Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont hauled in during the third quarter. The Sanders campaign announced its fundraising figures early Tuesday morning.

South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg brought in $19.1 million over the past three months. Sen. Kamala Harris of California reported bringing in $11.6 million, with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey raising over $6 million.

President Trump’s re-election team announced that they and the Republican National Committee combined hauled in a massive $125 million in the third quarter.

TRUMP'S RECORD-BREAKING $125 MILLION FUNDRAISING HAUL

Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado also released his fundraising figures on Wednesday. The long-shot contender for the nomination reported raising $2.1 million over the past three months, with $1.8 million cash on hand. The campaign noted that 86 percent of contributions were $25 or less.

“Our strategy to run a lean, strong campaign in early states is working, and we have the resources to compete and win. We’re continuing to run TV, rural radio, and digital ads and build out our infrastructure and staff,” Bennet campaign spokesperson Shannon Beckham emphasized.

Bennet didn’t make the cut for last month’s Democratic nomination debate and failed to qualify for this month’s showdown as well. That has not discouraged Bennet's campaign.

""Instead of allowing the DNC’s flawed debate criteria to dictate this race, we’re communicating directly with voters and caucusgoers,” Beckham said, taking aim at the Democratic National Committee’s thresholds to qualify for the debate."

The Democratic National Committee (DNC) on Wednesday announced the lineup for their Oct. 15 fourth-round presidential primary debate, and as expected, 12 candidates have qualified, meeting the polling and fundraising criteria.

That means the showdown will be the largest in presidential primary history, topping the 11 Republicans who faced off in a primary debate in September 2015, according to political research from Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a political newsletter and website.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

The dozen Democratic White House contenders who made the cut are – in alphabetical order – former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; businessman and environmental advocate Tom Steyer; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

The first two rounds of debates in June and July – with lower qualifying thresholds – were held over two consecutive nights with 10 candidates on the stage each evening. The thresholds were raised for the third-round debate, resulting in 10 candidates facing off on one night.

The DNC announced last week that the fourth-round debate would also be held on a single night. The 10 contenders who faced off in September automatically qualified for the October debate. And Gabbard and Steyer, who narrowly missed the September cut, reached the thresholds to qualify for the upcoming showdown by Tuesday’s deadline.

2020 DEMOCRATIC FIELD POISED FOR NEW PURGE WITH KEY DEADLINES APPROACHING

Twelve candidates on the same stage at the same time could make for an unwieldy debate and a lot of jockeying for time and attention.

Steyer told Fox News on Wednesday that “the DNC makes decisions and I try not to think about them.”

He emphasized that “the debates are a huge opportunity and that’s how I hope to use them,” but he also acknowledged that “if there are more people on the stage, then it’s harder, and I just have to deal with that.”

The Oct. 15 debate will be held at Otterbein University, a liberal arts institution in Westerville, Ohio. The DNC’s media partners for the showdown are CNN and The New York Times."

A Monmouth University survey suggests that Biden – one of the co-frontrunners in the Democratic race to face off next year against the president – could suffer some political damage from the Ukrainian allegations that sparked the Democrat-controlled House to formally launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump.

POLL SUGGESTS SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT GROWS, WITH AMERICANS NOW SPLIT

The survey, released Wednesday, indicates that a plurality of voters believed Trump’s accusations against Biden on that issue.

Trump and Biden each face a distinct set of allegations with regard to Ukraine. Trump is under fire from Democrats over his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he urged Zelensky to investigate the Biden family over their dealings in Ukraine. A whistleblower, along with Democrats, argue Trump in essence was asking a foreign country to potentially interfere in a U.S. election.

Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has repeatedly described his phone call with the Ukrainian leader as “perfect.”

At the same time, the president has sought to turn the tables on Biden by highlighting allegations against the former vice president and his son that he wanted investigated.

Biden’s son Hunter served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – who had been widely accused of overlooking corruption in his own office – was later dismissed. Trump’s re-election campaign last week launched a new TV and digital ad targeting Biden over his alleged actions.

The Monmouth poll indicates that 43 percent of registered voters believe Trump’s claim that Biden did pressure Ukrainian officials to keep them from investigating his son’s business ties, with 37 percent not buying the president’s allegations and one in five unsure.

Among crucial self-identified independent voters, 39 percent believe that Biden pressured Ukrainian officials, with 27 percent disagreeing and a third unsure.

“The fact that 4-in-10 independents are inclined to believe what they have heard from Trump is a warning sign for the Biden campaign. How the candidate fights back against this charge will be crucial to his argument of electability,” Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray said in a statement.

Biden's allies maintain he intervened in Ukraine over corruption concerns, not because of his son's work.

And Biden once again emphasized on Wednesday that ""there’s zero, zero evidence, of any assertion made.""

The survey also spells trouble for Trump, with just four in 10 registered voters continuing to say that the president should be re-elected, compared with 57 percent who say it’s time to have someone new in the White House.

“Trump’s base is sticking with him, but these results suggest that the president remains particularly weak among voting blocs that were crucial to putting him over the top in 2016,” Murray said.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

The survey is also the latest to indicate the race for the Democratic nomination is turning into a two-candidate battle between Biden and progressive champion Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

Warren stands at 28 percent support among self-identified Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters, with the former vice president at 25 percent. Warren’s advantage is within the survey’s sampling error.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, the populist independent senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House run, stands at 15 percent. Biden, Sanders and Warren were all tied in Monmouth’s previous poll, conducted in August.

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is at 5 percent in the survey, along with Sen. Kamala Harris of California. Tech-entrepreneur Andrew Yang and best-selling spiritual author Marianne Williamson are at 2 percent in the poll, with 11 other contenders in the record-setting Democratic field registering at 1 percent or less.

The Monmouth University poll was conducted Sept. 23-29, with 1,161 people questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s overall margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points."

Russell Bucklew was executed at the state prison in Bonne Terre for killing a man during a 1996 crime spree. It was Missouri’s first execution since January 2017.

Bucklew had twice been within hours of execution, only to have the U.S. Supreme Court grant last-minute reprieves over concerns that he might suffer during the execution process. He had a condition called cavernous hemangioma and had blood-filled tumors in his head, neck and throat. He breathed with the help from a tracheostomy tube.

Bucklew’s attorneys said in a clemency request to Gov. Mike Parson that a throat tumor could burst, causing Bucklew to choke and die painfully and in violation of the constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment.

LEGALLY HAUNTED NEW YORK HOME BACK ON THE MARKET

Adding to the concern was Missouri’s execution drug. The state uses a single dose of pentobarbital but refuses to say where it gets it from. The source is believed to be a compound pharmacy since large pharmaceutical companies prohibit the use of their drugs in executions.

The Supreme Court stepped in to halt Bucklew’s execution in 2014 and again in 2018. But in April, the high court gave the go-ahead for Bucklew to be executed.

Human rights groups and death penalty opponents, including all four Roman Catholic bishops in Missouri and the American Civil Liberties Union, urged Parson to grant clemency and remand Bucklew to life in prison without parole. The ACLU and Missourians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty presented the governor’s office on Thursday with petitions that they said included more than 57,000 signatures.

Parson, a Republican who worked in law enforcement for more than 20 years and a staunch death penalty supporter, decided early Tuesday that the execution could proceed.

Bucklew’s girlfriend, Stephanie Ray, left him on Valentine’s Day 1996. Over the next few weeks, according to court records, he harassed her, cut her with a knife and punched her in the face.

Ray feared for her life and the lives of her children, so she moved into the Cape Girardeau County mobile home that her new boyfriend, Michael Sanders, shared with his children.

On March 21, after stealing his nephew’s car and taking two pistols, handcuffs and duct tape from his brother, Bucklew followed Ray to Sanders’ home. Sanders confronted Bucklew with a shotgun inside the home. Bucklew fired two shots, one piercing Sanders’ lung. He bled to death.

Bucklew then shot at Sanders’ 6-year-old son and missed. Court records say he struck Ray in the face with the pistol, handcuffed her and dragged her to his car. He later raped Ray before heading north on Interstate 55.

A trooper spotted Bucklew’s car and eventually became engaged in a gunfight near St. Louis. Both men were wounded. Bucklew later escaped from the Cape Girardeau County Jail. He attacked Ray’s mother and her boyfriend with a hammer before being recaptured.

Bucklew’s attorneys, Cheryl Pilate and Jeremy Weis, said in a statement that Bucklew was remorseful for his crimes.

Bucklew looked around and twitched his feet beneath the sheet as he lay on the gurney just before the lethal injection. He suddenly took a deep breath and all movement stopped.

There were no outward signs of distress.

TEAM TRUMP CONSIDERS APPEALING TO DEMS IN GOP DISTRICTS

WaPo: “White House officials intent on stopping the House from impeaching President Trump are considering appealing to moderate Democrats in Republican districts to stand with the president, a pursuit at odds with fresh political attacks from the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee. The nascent outreach campaign would target some of the 31 Democrats from congressional districts Trump won in 2016, many of whom ran on rebuilding infrastructure, improving trade deals and lowering the cost of prescription drugs, according to multiple officials familiar with the strategy. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely, said the appeal would be based on these Democrats’ 2018 election promises to work with the president — accompanied with a warning that impeachment would hamper possible legislative victories.”



Impeachment vets urge caution - AP: “But the Republicans who carried out President Bill Clinton’s impeachment in 1998 are unanimous in urging caution and restraint as Congress embarks on yet another impeachment struggle, this time over accusations that President Donald Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and Biden’s son. The impeachment veterans of two decades ago were thrust into a seismic political event that was sober and circus-like at the same time. So began a new, angry chapter of American politics that strained Washington institutions that were stronger then than now. … Today, those Clinton impeachment Republicans are urging a pause in the tribalism of the Trump era. … The best-known is Lindsey Graham, a former Air Force prosecutor who was among those most aggressively gunning for Clinton. … The most senior of two Clinton prosecutor remaining in the House is Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin... Clinton impeachment manager Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, wasn’t eager to take a walk down memory lane when encountered in the Capitol last week…”



Kraushaar: The impeachment bellwethers - National Journal: “All told, the numbers suggest that while the politics of impeachment hearings now favor the Democrats, the prospect of building enough bipartisan support to remove Trump from office remains remote. … It’s easy to expect the Republican base remaining solidly behind the president regardless of new information, but it’s hard to see how the broader politics improve for Trump or his party. Despite the partisanship, there are still many members of Congress whose perspective on impeachment going forward will be worth watching closely. They’re the bellwethers, the swing votes whose forthcoming reactions will reflect the mood of the country. There are four categories of members I’m closely watching: the swing-state Republicans, the red-state Democrats, the Republican retirees, and the swing-district freshman Democrats with national security experience.”



Jim Geraghty: Don’t obsess over whistleblower - National Review: “Here’s an assessment sure to be unpopular: When the story of the impeachment effort against President Trump is written, the whistleblower will be an afterthought or a minor player in the overall story at most. Either the whistleblower’s claims are accurate, or they aren’t. Impeachment will hinge upon whether President Trump’s actions strike lawmakers as an effort to effectively blackmail Ukraine into finding dirt on Joe Biden, or whether it’s just Trump being Trump, wanting the facts on Biden strong-arming a foreign government to fire a prosecutor who might have been investigating a company that employed his son. The vast majority of lawmakers’ conclusions on this will just happen to align with their partisan affiliations.”



Schumer continues to press McConnell - Politico: “Chuck Schumer wants Senate Democrats to keep the pressure on Mitch McConnell to hold a fair trial if impeachment of President Donald Trump comes to the Senate — but he also wants to keep whacking the majority leader for presiding over a ‘legislative graveyard.’ The Senate minority leader convened a conference call with his caucus on Wednesday to stay focused on its double-barreled messaging tactics while his 47 members are scattered across the country in the middle of a two-week recess, according to three people familiar with the call. … Schumer (D-N.Y.) urged his colleagues to not act partisan amid the impeachment inquiry and pressure McConnell (R-Ky.) to commit to a fair process if the House impeaches the president, according to a Democratic aide briefed on the call. … A second Democrat briefed on the call said some in the party are anxious for more strategic guidance from party leaders.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Trump attacks his own presidency - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains the Democrats’ evidence against President Trump and why he should present a principled defense if he has one: “Federal law defines as criminal the solicitation of aid – anything of value – for a political campaign from a foreign national or foreign government, whether the thing of value arrives or not. Federal law also prohibits bribery and attempted bribery, which is defined as withholding the performance of an official duty conditioned upon the personal receipt of a thing of value, whether the thing of value arrives or not. The law further prohibits intimidating witnesses, which is defined as the use of language designed to deter witnesses from giving testimony, whether the intimidation is successful or not.” More here.

TIME OUT: THE TECH BEHIND MUSIC

Smithsonian: “With its cheery singles, theatrical medley and iconic cover, The Beatles’ 11th studio album, ‘Abbey Road,’ holds a special place in the hearts of the band’s fans. But as the album celebrates its 50th anniversary, few may realize just how groundbreaking its tracks were for the band. In [William D. Moylan’s] forthcoming book, ‘Recording Analysis: How the Record Shapes the Song,’ [he shows] how the recording process can enhance the artistry of songs, and ‘Abbey Road’ is one of the albums [he highlights]. Beginning with 1965’s ‘Rubber Soul,’ The Beatles started exploring new sounds. This quest continued in ‘Abbey Road,’ where the band was able to deftly incorporate emerging recording technology in a way that set the album apart from everything they had previously done. … ‘Abbey Road’ … shows how a song can be poetically written and an instrument deftly played. But the way a track is recorded can be the artist’s final stamp on the song.”

DEMS GRUMBLE OVER LARGE DEBATE STAGE

Politico: “The next Democratic presidential primary debate will likely be historic — but probably not for the reason Democrats were hoping. The Democratic National Committee announced Wednesday that 12 candidates have qualified for the Oct. 15 debate in Westerville, Ohio. And unlike the previous rounds, when the stage was limited to 10 candidates, which resulted in the first two debates being split into two consecutive nights, all 12 are set to share one stage on Oct. 15.This would make it the largest presidential primary debate ever, Republican or Democrat… Invited to the debate are: Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julián Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang. If none of the candidates drop out between now and the debate — and Sanders participates in the debate after his recent heart procedure — it will surpass the previous record of 11 candidates on a primary debate stage, set by Republicans during the 2016 cycle. The crowded stage is leading to some grumbling from Democrats, who are already conscious about their speaking time.”



Biden tries to fashion a Super Tuesday firewall - Politico: “Joe Biden’s campaign is ramping up its investment in Super Tuesday states, anticipating a Democratic race that narrows to two candidates by early March. The increase in staffing across the 14 states that will vote March 3 comes as Biden’s polling figures have declined and Elizabeth Warren’s have surged, particularly in states like Iowa and New Hampshire where she’s heavily invested in field organization. The former vice president’s campaign is still counting on strong finishes in the four early nominating states. But in the event of weaker-than-expected performances, a built-out Super Tuesday organization would provide a fail-safe for Biden. Many of the states on the Super Tuesday map — which includes a handful of Southern and Border states — play to his strengths among African-American voters and more moderate Democrats.”



Molly Ball: Harris remains an enigma to voters - Time: “Perhaps, in these days of brutal ideological combat, that kind of pragmatism could be sold as refreshing. But in Harris’ case it seems to be having the opposite effect. Some of the attendees at her events in Iowa told me they don’t think she’s progressive enough; others said she strikes them as too far left. ‘She hasn’t gone far enough to get the activists behind her, but she’s gone too far for some of the moderates,’ says Larry Gerston, a professor emeritus of political science at San Jose State University. ‘So she’s in kind of a no-person’s-land in terms of having a good base.’ And yet, polls indicate that Democratic voters still want to like her–if only they can figure out what she’s about. The race is far from over. Iowa voters are notorious for shopping around until the end.”



Klobuchar leans on family’s Iron Range roots - Roll Call: “If there’s proof of Klobuchar’s strengths as a candidate, it’s her margins in conservative parts of Minnesota. Despite Trump winning the 8th District — home to the Iron Range — by 16 points in 2016, and Democrats losing the seat last fall, Klobuchar carried it by more than 10 points in her 2018 reelection. But as Democrats have seen slippage in the Midwest, so has Klobuchar. Her margins last year in some conservative congressional districts were significantly lower than in 2012. Before she can try to extend that Minnesota success nationwide, she has to win over the Democratic Party base. ‘It would be unlikely,’ [University of Minnesota professor Larry] Jacobs said. ‘But I never give up on Amy Klobuchar. No one is going to outwork her.’”

“There are different ways to bake the cake, depending on what sort of cake you want.

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I do enjoy reading the Halftime report and especially the From the Bleachers section where I can see how others are reacting to what they read. Your responses are usually spot on but [on Tuesday] I took umbrage to your calling the impeachment process ‘festivities’. While politics in general tends to resemble Battlebots and political conventions are certainly festive the gravity of what is taking place in Washington now should be handled with more seriousness. The potential removal of a duly elected president regardless of the outcome will leave wounds on this country that will take a long time to heal. We may not recognize our Republic when all is said and done due to the scars left behind. One can only hope that later generations can learn where we failed to, so that Impeachment, or the threat of it, is not used as a political tool every 4 years and never becomes something resembling a festival.” – Dave Fischer, Memphis, Tenn.



[Ed. note: I know that it’s very tempting to think the worst, Mr. Fischer. It not only seems more dramatic and historic than being optimistic, it also fits into the nation’s dour mood these days. I know it’s also tempting to take umbrage. In fact, umbrage taking has become sort of our new national pastime. The outrage olympics have overtaken our politics in a profound way. And while I do feel bad that you were offended at my jocularity, I am going to continue to decline to take politics so seriously. The issues at stake are too important to hang on every word of politicians. There’s no way around the partisan conflict ahead, but I still tend to think that there’s something better waiting on the other side. I’m grateful for your readership and hope you can stick with us despite my commitment to due flippancy.]



“Some are saying in the Senate trial, assuming the president is impeached, that the president’s attorneys will have the opportunity to subpoena and question anyone. By anyone, they’re suggesting Comey, Strzok, Page, Ohr, Holder, Lynch, Steele, Brennan, Clapper, not to mention Hilary Clinton… quite literally, anyone. It’s difficult to imagine that this is so, but, if it is, well, the country’s in for a tantalizing, and surely painful, show…” – B. A. Street, Colorado Springs, Colo.



[Ed. note: The Senate gets to make up its own trial rules. How long, how many witnesses, in what order, etc. would all be up for grabs if the House impeaches. I think the scenario you describe – weeks of confusing testimony going down alternate narratives, etc. – would be a bipartisan nightmare. Instead, I expect senators would prefer tight, concise presentations.]

The Blue Bowl, a charity flag football game, was intended to raise money for the family of fallen Ventura County Sgt. Ron Helus as well as other officers killed in the line of duty, FOX 11 of Los Angeles reported.

Helus died last Nov. 7, when a 28-year-old suspect allegedly attacked the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, killing a total of 13 people and wounding about a dozen others. The suspect died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities have said.

Thousands of dollars had already been raised for fallen officers' families, but the money is now being returned to donors because Thousand Oaks Police Chief Tim Hagel reportedly withdrew the police department because Trump supporters would be speaking at the event.

HANNITY: DEMS WANT TO IMPEACH TRUMP BECAUSE THEY'RE 'HELL-BENT ON TAKING REVENGE' FOR 2016 DEFEAT

'Wow, are you kidding me?'

""He basically said over and over in the conversation, 'This is not Trump country, that slogan 'Make America Great' is not favorable, popular, within 1,200 square miles,' that we don’t want Republicans here. I could not believe it,” Mike Randall, vice president of the Fallen Officers Foundation, said, according to FOX 11.

“'The only thing,' and I quote, 'the only thing you [could have done to make] this worse, Mike, was to invite Dick Cheney and Sarah Huckabee Sanders.'

""And I went, 'Wow, are you kidding me?""

Both Democrats and Republicans were invited to the event. Gov. Gavin Newsom's public safety liaison, Trump supporter Scott Baio, who attended Helus’ church, and Trump-supporting singer Joy Villa were all scheduled to attend.

He also said Democratic Assemblywoman Jacqui Irwin was upset that her former opponent had been invited.

He added that Hagel told him to get rid of the Republican speakers or the police department would withdraw. They finally did pull out.

""He goes, 'Yeah, this ain’t gonna work for us,' I said, 'You’re not gonna support this with the honor guard?' And he goes, 'No, we’re not bringing the honor guard. We’re not coming. We’re not going to be there, not supporting it',"" said Randall.

'This is not OK. This is prejudice.'

The Ventura County Sheriff’s Department issued a statement, saying:



""The 'Blue Bowl' event was represented as a charitable flag football tournament to raise funds for the family of Sergeant Ron Helus. An event that would honor Ron’s memory and provide support to his wife Karen and son Jordan. As the event began to materialize, we became concerned with the behavior of some of the organizers of the event. Although I believe the organizers had good intentions, the event was moving in a direction we no longer felt comfortable supporting.”

Singer Villa called the chief's response ""disgusting.""

""This is not OK. This is prejudice, hello?"" she said. ""You’re shutting down an event because of the way conservatives think, because I support the president? This is disgusting, I’m appalled, and in all my years being an out conservative, I’ve never seen something so despicable like this.”

TRUMP FILES LAWSUIT IN BID TO PROTECT PERSONAL, CORPORATE TAX RETURNS FROM RELEASE

The ""Blue Bowl"" was set to be held this month in honor of slain Thousand Oaks Sheriff's Sergeant Ron Helus. Helus, a 29-year law enforcement veteran, died in the mass shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill last year.

Thousands of dollars had already been raised for fallen officers' families, but the money is now being returned to donors.

Zore told host Ainsley Earhardt that they invited local and national leaders to the memorial and ""anyone of influence that would like to speak at the event.""

Trump-supporting singer Joy Villa was set to sing the national anthem. Villa's father was a military police officer. Actor Scott Baio, who had gone to church with Helus, also wanted to speak at the event.

""And, it's all to speak on law enforcement and law enforcement only,"" Zore explained. ""We do not bring politics into this. And, on September 14th we added Ronda Kennedy who is a local attorney. And, on September 16th, we got the phone call that they had issues with some of the speakers that we were having.""

""We were asked in the phone call: 'Isn't Scott Baio part of some right-wing group?' And, we were kind of taken aback by that,"" Zore said. ""The chief continued to say that these people do not represent the fabric of the community. That the Make America Great slogan is not popular within a 1,200-mile radius of the community. And that they...didn't want any Republican speakers there.""

Zore also added that Thousand Oaks Police Chief Tim Hagel said: ""Nothing good of this would come out of this event if we had these people speaking.""

Singer Villa called Hagel's response ""disgusting"" and that in all her years being an ""out conservative"" she'd ""never seen something so despicable like this.""

""This is not OK. This is prejudice, hello?"" said Villa. ""You're shutting down an event because of the way conservatives think, because I support the president?""

According to FOX 11, Mike Randall, the vice president of the Robert L. Zore Foundation, recalled the chief saying, ""The only thing you [could have done to make] this worse, Mike, was to invite Dick Cheney and Sarah Huckabee Sanders.""

""It was like blow to the stomach hearing that response because it was never political. It was made political when we got the phone call from Chief Hagel telling us that we were making it political,"" Zore said.

""It's devastating to me because we have all the right intentions,"" said Zore.

""I want everyone to come together. There's a war on cops right now, and it's terrible what's happening to our law enforcement and it's important for all of us to unite. No matter where you come from."""

The Washington Mystics hope to have Elena Delle Donne back for both of them.

Jonquel Jones scored 32 points and grabbed 18 rebounds, and the Sun took advantage of Delle Donne's early injury exit to beat the Mystics 99-87 in Game 2 of the WNBA Finals on Tuesday night and even the series.

""This was our goal, to steal a win on their floor,"" said Sun guard Jasmine Thomas. ""And now we get to go home and play two in a row.""

Alyssa Thomas added 21 points and 12 rebounds, and Courtney Williams had 22 points for the Sun, who dominated the paint after the 6-foot-5 Delle Donne departed in the first quarter with back spasms.

The recently crowned league MVP, who averaged 19.5 points and 8.2 rebounds this season, will have an MRI Wednesday.

""She's just had, kind of ongoing, late-in-the-season tightness,"" said Mystics coach Mike Thibault. ""We've been able to treat it and it's responded pretty well. But it's the one nightmare I've had the last month, is seeing her lying on her back.""

Connecticut outrebounded Washington 41-27 overall and 17-6 on the offensive glass. Jones, who didn't have an offensive board in the first game, had a WNBA Finals record nine. She also only took eight shots in the series opener, which Connecticut lost 95-86.

""I was disappointed in Game 1,"" said Jones, who had the most points in the finals since 2011 when Angel McCoughtry had 38 and Seimone Augustus 36. ""Disappointed with my lack of getting offensive boards, I had to make a change.""

In Game 2, Emma Meeseman scored 22 points off the bench for Washington after spelling Delle Donne early in the first quarter and Tianna Hawkins added 16. Washington's bench outscored Connecticut's 52-9.

Kristi Toliver was the Mystics' only starter in double figures with 13 points. Delle Donne finished scoreless after taking just two early shots.

""She's such a big part of what they do. You don't want to wish injury on anyone, but we knew it was a chance to steal one here,"" Jones said.

Even so, after Connecticut led by as many as 14 points in the second quarter, the Mystics fought back from a 10-point halftime deficit to tie it briefly.

Aerial Powers converted a three-point play before adding a slashing layup on Toliver's feed to cut it to 71-69 late in the third to complete a 7-0 run. Toliver's runner evened it at 76-all with 8:14 left in the game.

The Sun responded with a 6-0 spurt to take the lead for good. Jones hit a putback before Williams added a pair of inside buckets, the latter after two offensive rebounds from Jones, to make it 82-76.

""J.J. was going crazy today,"" Williams said. ""I told her I felt like I could put up the ball from half court and she was going to look out for me and get the rebound.""

EVERY MINUTE COUNTS

Thomas has now played all 40 minutes of the series. Her average of 36 minutes this postseason leads all players who have played in multiple playoff games.

""She just is so important to us,"" explained coach Curt Miller. ""She anchors our defense. ... I don't think there's a better defender in the league.""

FIRST HALF FOLLEY

Thibault thought his team eventually reacted well to Delle Donne's departure, but only allowing the Sun a 12-2 run in the first quarter and another 11-0 stretch in the second.

""I thought we got deflated when Elena went out,"" Thibault said. ""It took us too long to recover from that and say, 'OK, we can still win this.'""

TIP-INS

Sun: Jones passed her Game 1 scoring total of 12 points when she hit a layup 4:25 left in the first half to reach 14. She had 18 points and 10 rebounds by halftime. ... G Layshia Clarendon (right ankle) did not play after Miller said Monday she was questionable for the game. She hasn't seen game action since June 16.

Mystics: Delle Donne also missed the teams' first regular season meeting in 2019 with knee soreness, an 84-69 Sun victory on May 25. ... C LaToya Sanders picked up a technical for a defensive 3-second violation with 39 seconds left in the first half, and Hawkins committed the same offense midway through the third quarter.

* Presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders remains hospitalized, but according to his wife, the Vermont senator will not need any additional medical procedures and he expects to participate in the Democratic primary debate scheduled for Oct. 15.

* Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign raised $24.6 million in the third quarter, which is a very impressive haul, and puts her second only to Bernie Sanders’ $25.3 million quarter. [Update: I added this item after originally publishing the round-up.]

* Reinforcing impressions that Donald Trump’s 2020 campaign sees Joe Biden as a threat, the president’s operation is launching a $1 million ad buy in early primary states, airing a new attack ad peddling a discredited conspiracy theory involving the former vice president and Ukraine.

* Speaking of Biden, the Democratic campaign announced yesterday that it raised $12.5 million in the third quarter. It’s an underwhelming haul, which is roughly half the money Sanders raised over the same three-month period.

* For his part, Biden is moving forward with a $6 million ad buy in the first four states holding 2020 nominating contests.

* At an official White House event in Florida yesterday, Trump discussed 2020 campaign strategy, went after Elizabeth Warren with his “Pocahontas” slur, and labeled Joe Biden “Sleepy Joe.” It served as a reminder that the president obviously has no qualms about blurring the lines of propriety ahead of 2020.

* In an increasingly common dynamic in the GOP, former Rep. Pete Sessions (R) is launching a comeback bid in a new congressional district. Sessions lost last year in Texas’ 32nd district – an area he’d represented for more than two decades – so he’s now moving to Texas’ 17th district, which will be home to an open-seat contest next year.

* A new Washington Post-Schar School poll shows Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) with a 47% approval rating, despite his recent racial controversy. The same poll found Trump with a 39% approval rating in the commonwealth.

* And in Ohio, the latest Emerson poll shows Biden narrowly leading Sanders, 29% to 27%, with Warren not far behind with 21%. Also of note, the survey found each of the Democratic contenders leading Trump in Ohio in hypothetical general election match-ups."

* The same poll found roughly 39% of registered voters believe Donald Trump deserves a second term, while 57% are ready for a new president.

* Much of the Democrats’ 2020 field participated in an MSNBC policy forum yesterday on addressing gun violence. NBC published a live-blog of the event.

* The lineup and podium order for the next Democratic presidential primary debate was announced yesterday, and it will be a one-night, 12-candidate event.

* With only a month remaining ahead of Louisiana’s gubernatorial race, Trump is urging his followers in the state to support either Eddie Rispone (R) or Ralph Abraham (R), one of whom is likely to advance to a probable runoff against incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards (D).

* Similarly, with time running out in Mississippi’s gubernatorial race, the president is throwing his support behind Tate Reeves’ (R) candidacy, arguing yesterday that his rival, state Attorney General Jim Hood (D), is “pro-Crooked Hillary.” In case anyone’s curious, the 2016 election was 1,058 days ago."

Appearing on ""America's Newsroom"" with host Bill Hemmer, Verma said President Trump's executive order – which would expand the program's private insurance option – is ""all about demonstrating his vision to protect and secure the Medicare program.""

In the executive order, the Trump administration claims his Medicare plan will:

Provide more plan choices and time with providers

Streamline approval of therapies

Reform link payments with value

Eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse

Reduce regulation

‘MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' SPONSOR SAYS PLAN WOULD GUT 1 MILLION PRIVATE INSURANCE JOBS

""He's just building on the tremendous success that we've already had with the program,"" she told Hemmer. ""President Trump's Medicare program is putting money back into the pockets of seniors. We've lowered out-of-pocket costs for drugs and for doctors' visits.""

She added that Medicare Advantage rates were announced at historic lows, citing lower Part D premiums and decreases in drug pricing.

Medicare itself remains popular, but 2020 Democratic presidential candidates' calls to enact a single-payer, government-run system for everyone are far more controversial. Speaking to a retirement community in Florida on Thursday, the president said Democrats want to ""raid Medicare to fund the idea of socialism.""

CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM

""All of the Democrats' plans would totally devastate our health care plans,"" he exclaimed.

Sanders' ""single-payer"" approach would cover people of any age and would incorporate the Medicare program. Private health insurance, including the Medicare Advantage option used by about one-third of seniors, would no longer have a role.

Sanders, who underwent a heart procedure this week, has argued that ""Medicare-for-all"" would offer seniors broader benefits and lower costs.

""In all of these versions, whether it's 'Medicare-for-all' or the public option ... what they're talking about is a government takeover of our private health care system stripping 180 million Americans from private coverage and putting them into a government-run program,"" Verma explained.

""What we've seen from other countries that have tried these socialist experiments is that that leads to reductions in care, reduced access, long wait times, and rationing of care,"" she said.

The figure affirms the momentum Warren has appeared to be gaining in recent weeks and months, as polls show her now battling Biden – once the unrivaled front-runner – for the primary lead.

While Sanders remains in third position in many polls, his fundraising is unmatched, totaling $25.3 million in the third quarter.

BIDEN RAISES $15.2 MILLION IN THIRD QUARTER, DOWN $6 MILLION FROM APRIL-JUNE HAUL

But Warren's campaign cash number comes close — and is far ahead of the $15.2 million raised by Biden in the last quarter.

Warren and Biden are essentially tied for the lead position in most recent national and early-voting-state Democratic nomination polls.

The Massachusetts senator, who’s produced one progressive policy proposal after another, announced her fundraising figures on Twitter, saying, “I’m grateful down to my toes for every grassroots supporter who chipped in.”

“Together, we’re building a movement that’s going to put power back in the hands of the people,” she pledged.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Warren’s third-quarter haul is up nearly $6 million from what she raised during the April-June quarter.

Her campaign announced that they received 943,000 contributions from more than a half-million individual donors, with 300,000 of those donors giving for the first time. And they reported that the average contribution to Warren was $26.

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg reported raising $19.1 million this quarter.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California reported bringing in $11.6 million in the third quarter, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang hauling in $10 million, triple what he raised in the second quarter. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey announced he raised over $6 million.

Best-selling spiritual author Marianne Williamson said she raised over $3 million and Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado reported raising $2.1 million.

President Trump’s reelection team, meanwhile, blew past all of them. The campaign announced that it and the Republican National Committee combined had brought in a massive $125 million in the third quarter.

Asked Thursday during a campaign stop in California how she could compete with Trump's massive war chest if she reaches the general election, Warren touted her ""grassroots movement"" and highlighted ""that's going to be our comparative advantage to win in November 2020.""

Tuesday was the first day campaigns could announce their third-quarter numbers, but they have until Oct. 15 to file their fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission.

Campaign cash is a crucial barometer of a candidate’s appeal and popularity and of his or her campaign’s strength. Fundraising dollars can be used by the candidates to pay for campaign staff and grassroots outreach efforts, travel and ads.

Soon after, he posted a video on Twitter showing him standing at a Las Vegas park with his wife Jane

""I just got out of the hospital a few hours ago and I'm feeling so much better,"" Sanders said. ""See you soon on the campaign trail.""

Sanders and his wife both thanked people for their warm wishes. The candidate was expected to return to Vermont.

The candidate's doctors said Sanders is making “progress.”

“The senator was stable upon arrival and taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, at which time two stents were placed in a blocked coronary artery in a timely fashion. All other arteries were normal,” they said.

The doctors added: “His hospital course was uneventful with good expected progress. He was discharged with instructions to follow up with his personal physician.”

Sanders himself posted a message on Twitter Wednesday afternoon to reassure his followers that he was on the mend and to do some campaigning for his push for universal healthcare dubbed ""Medicare-for-all.""

The campaign said on Wednesday that Sanders would stay off the campaign trail “until further notice.”

But the candidate's wife Jane Sanders highlighted in a statement on Thursday that ""we expect Bernie will be discharged and on a plane back to Burlington before the end of the weekend. He'll take a few days to rest, but he's ready to get back out there and is looking forward to the October debate.”

She noted that ""Bernie is up and about. Yesterday, he spent much of the day talking with staff about policies, cracking jokes with the nurses and doctors, and speaking with his family on the phone. His doctors are pleased with his progress, and there has been no need for any additional procedures.""

Twelve candidates have qualified for the Oct. 15 debate, which will be held at Otterbein University, a liberal arts institution in Westerville, Ohio. The Democratic National Committee’s media partners for the showdown are CNN and The New York Times.

Sanders officials confirmed to Fox News on Wednesday that they’ve postponed running their first TV commercial of the campaign. The spot in Iowa was supposed to hit airwaves in the first caucus state starting on Thursday. The campaign announced the $1.3 million ad buy earlier in the week.

But a senior campaign official told Fox News that overall, “campaign operations are continuing as usual” while the senator is sidelined."

Elizabeth Warren D-Mass., will be the Democratic nominee for president in 2020.

""Maybe I'm jumping the gun, but it sure seems to me that Elizabeth Warren is real close to locking up the Democrat nomination,"" Varney said on his Fox Nation show, ""My Take."" ""... Look at what's happened just in the last few days. Bernie Sanders has had heart surgery for a blocked artery. All campaign events canceled until further notice,""

TRUMP BACKERS TORMENT WARREN IN NEVADA

A series of polls released this week shows Warren leading Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden both among national voters and in early primary and caucus states.

BERNIE SANDERS HAS STENTS INSERTED AFTER DOCTORS FIND BLOCKAGE

Sanders took a break from the trail this week after he ended up in the hospital with heart complications and underwent an emergency procedure Tuesday to repair a blocked artery, according to his campaign.

""We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates,"" Sanders' campaign said in a statement.

Varney argued that Sanders' hospital visit lends credence to those questioning whether his age will get in the way of securing a spot in the Oval Office.

WARREN CONTINUES ATTACK ON FACEBOOK AFTER ZUCKERBERG REVEALS IT WOULD SUE GOVERNMENT IF SHE BECOMES PRESIDENT

""There are now obvious questions about whether a 78-year-old can endure months of exhausting campaigning,"" he said.

Varney then turned to Biden, who has come under fire since the launch of a formal impeachment investigation against President Trump over the content of a phone call during which Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about Biden and son Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine.

""He is a casualty of the impeachment, he is collateral damage,"" said Varney. ""All the attention given to the Ukraine call has brought back the question about Hunter Biden, and the money he received in Ukraine and China.""

""It all happened so quickly,"" he continued, ""but as of now, it's Elizabeth Warren's nomination to lose.""

However, Varney said he didn't think Warren could win the general election in November 2020 ""for two reasons.""

""I don't think Americans will elect as president someone who wants to destroy our economic system,"" he said. ""Elizabeth Warren is a socialist. Her proposals would destroy capitalism, and with it, the prosperity we enjoy today.""

VARNEY: HONG KONG ENGAGED IN URBAN WARFARE

Varney said the second reason was due to Warren's ""demeanor,""

""Anger is Senator Warren's frequent theme, hating capitalism, the rich, the billionaires, Wall Street -- that plays well to socialists, but on your screens, every day for four years, anger is not so attractive,"" he said. ""... You've got to be good on TV to win these days.""

Varney also issued a warning to Democrats, saying they should be ""very worried,"" should ""far-left"" Warren win the nomination.

""Far-left Warren is now very likely to be the nominee and outside of California and New York, Democrats should be very worried,"" he concluded.

Biden’s haul is a drop of more than $6 million from the $21.5 million he raised in the April-June second quarter of fundraising, and is far behind the $25.3 million that nomination rival Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont brought in the past three months. It’s also less than the $19.1 million that South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg raised in the third quarter.

SANDERS HAULS IN AN EYE-POPPING $25.3 MILLION IN THIRD QUARTER

Highlighting the numbers, Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz noted that “today’s fundraising totals put the campaign in a strong position as we enter the fall. The question any campaign faces at this point is whether or not you have the resources to compete in early states and sustain your efforts beyond. Our campaign unequivocally does, and builds on our strength each week.”

The Biden camp emphasized that 98 percent of all donations were from grassroots donors giving $200 or less, and that 56 percent of contributors in the past three months were new to the campaign.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California reported bringing in $11.6 million in the third quarter, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang hauling in $10 million, triple what he raised in the second quarter. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey announced he raised over $6 million.

Best-selling spiritual author Marianne Williamson said she raised over $3 million and Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado reported raising $2.1 million.

Among those yet to report third-quarter fundraising figures is Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is tied with Biden for the lead position in most the recent national and early-voting-state Democratic nomination polls.

President Trump’s reelection team announced that it and the Republican National Committee combined had brought in a massive $125 million in the third quarter.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Tuesday was the first day campaigns could announce their third-quarter numbers, but they have until Oct. 15 to officially file their fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission.

Campaign cash is a crucial barometer of a candidate’s appeal and popularity and of his or her campaign’s strength. The third-quarter fundraising figures of the Democratic presidential candidates will be heavily analyzed and scrutinized. Fundraising dollars can be used by the candidates to pay for campaign staff and grassroots outreach efforts, travel, and ads."

The Yang campaign revealed this week that it had raised $10 million in the third quarter, which a significant jump from $1.7 million from the first quarter and the $2.8 million from the second quarter.

However, members of the #YangGang on social media took notice that Yang's fundraising efforts were left out by CNN and MSNBC.

In CNN's graphic that went viral, it showed Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., leading the pack in the third quarter with $25.3 million, followed by South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg with $19.1 million, then former Vice President Joe Biden with $15.2 million, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif, with $11.6 million, and lastly, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who raised only $6 million, an amount many critics pointed out was lower than Yang's.

MSNBC'S CHUCK TODD SOUNDS THE ALARM ON TRUMP: 'THE NATIONAL NIGHTMARE IS UPON US'

""Maybe next time we should raise $20 million!"" Yang joked.

Yang's tone took a shift when a similar graphic from MSNBC went viral, showing Sanders, Buttigieg, Harris, and Booker.

""I’m pretty sure I should be on this graphic,"" Yang reacted.

MSNBC later responded, saying the graphic was made before Yang released his campaign fundraising numbers.

Biden’s campaign announced that it's reserving “prime advertising space on traditional television and on digital platforms like YouTube, Hulu and news and sports streaming services” in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, the first four states on the presidential nominating calendar.

WARREN SHOWCASES $10 MILLION AD BUY IN EARLY VOTING STATES

The move comes a week after Warren’s campaign said it would dish out at least $10 million to run digital and TV spots in the same four crucial states.

Warren and Biden are virtually tied for the top spot in most recent national and early-voting-state polls.

While the Biden campaign is already running digital ads across the country and has spent six figures to run TV commercials in Iowa, this is its first major multi-state ad buy.

“We’ve been up on the airwaves in Iowa and blown away by the reaction we’ve seen to Vice President Biden’s deeply personal ad about health care,” Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz said in a statement.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign announced earlier this week that it would go up Thursday with the first TV commercial of the Vermont senator’s 2020 White House bid.

Medicare itself remains popular, but the calls to enact a single-payer, government-run system for everyone are far more controversial. Signing the order at the Villages – a retirement community north of Orlando – Trump singled out Democrats he said want to “totally obliterate Medicare.”

“They want to raid Medicare to fund the idea of socialism,” Trump said. “All of the Democrats' plans would totally devastate our health care plans.”

Trump added, “Democratic health care proposals would put everyone into a single-payer, socialist government-run plan.”

‘MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' SPONSOR SAYS PLAN WOULD GUT 1 MILLION PRIVATE INSURANCE JOBS

The president’s criticism of the Democrats' plan was squarely aimed at the Medicare-for-all proposals of candidates like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

Sanders’ “single-payer” approach would cover people of any age and would incorporate the Medicare program. Private health insurance, including the Medicare Advantage option used by about one-third of seniors, would no longer have a role.

Medicare Advantage, the private insurance option under Medicare, offers savings on premiums and an annual limit on out-of-pocket costs. They provide one-stop shopping, eliminating the need for separate supplemental insurance. Offered by major insurers, the plans also cover prescription drugs in most cases.

But there are trade-offs. Seniors joining a Medicare Advantage plan generally must accept limits on their choice of hospitals and doctors as well as prior insurer approval for certain procedures. If they change their minds and decide to return to traditional Medicare, they’re not always guaranteed supplemental “Medigap” coverage, which is also private.

Trump’s order directs his department to examine whether its current policies and practices put traditional Medicare ahead of the private Medicare Advantage option.

The order would seek to expand the range of additional services that can be offered by the private plans and would direct regulators to find more ways for seniors to financially benefit from plans that provide cost-efficient service.

FELLOW 2020 CANDIDATE CALLS BERNIE'S 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' PLAN A 'LOSING BATTLE' THAT WILL SET COUNTRY BACK 10 YEARS

Many Medicare Advantage insurers offer some dental and vision coverage, along with basics like transportation to medical appointments. But the industry lately has started to experiment with in-home assistance, including nutritious meals and financial help with safety-related home improvements.

Sanders, who underwent a heart procedure this week, has argued that Medicare-for-all would offer seniors broader benefits and lower costs. In a tweet on Wednesday, Sanders reiterated the support for his proposal and added that “no one should fear going bankrupt” because of a hospital trip.

""None of us know when a medical emergency might affect us. And no one should fear going bankrupt if it occurs. Medicare for All!""

Trump also took time during his speech to slam Democrats for opening an impeachment inquiry over a phone call the president had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July. In it, he asked Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s family’s dealings in the country.

“It’s corruption going on right now,” Trump said, calling congressional leaders “Do Nothing Dems” and the inquiry ""a hoax.""

On the roster: Trump offers no off-ramps for Republicans - Time Out: Bon appétit, y’all - Warren, Sanders lap Biden in third quarter fundraising - The real reason the chicken crossed the road



TRUMP OFFERS NO OFF-RAMPS FOR REPUBLICANS

The news these days is pretty grim for the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress.



The central claim of the whistleblower who came forward to authorities was that President Trump was pressuring America’s Ukrainian allies for dirt on Trump’s chief political rival, Joe Biden.



It has not only been proven true, the president is now doing it right out in the open. He’s even added China to the list of foreign powers he wants to provide opposition research on the Democratic front runner.



Worse, newly revealed texts between American diplomats show that senior State Department officials believed that Trump was conditioning U.S. aid to the long-beleaguered former Soviet republic on the provision of anti-Biden goodies.



But in potentially the worst development so far, it is now alleged that Trump’s personal defense attorney was dangling the promise of an official diplomatic visit to the White House for the Ukrainian president in exchange for a public statement from the Ukrainian leader to investigate Biden and his family’s business dealings in Kyiv.



Team Trump is having some success in deflecting attention, discrediting the California Democrat in charge of the House Intelligence Committee (who’s doing a pretty good job of discrediting himself) and bringing increased attention to the younger Biden’s super-swampy business model.



But the damage is already done. Trump has admitted that the central allegations are true. He has been and is using his office for his own political advantage. All presidents do in more innocuous ways — Air Force One as campaign prop, “official” events as rallies, the White House as an extension of the campaign — but dragging diplomats and involving one of the most potentially dangerous parts of the globe is new.



For Trump loyalists who are in the shoot-‘em-on-Fifth-Avenue club, this is not a problem. They agree with the president that his conduct was “perfect.” They are also convinced that Trump’s predecessor did as bad or worse but was protected by the media. But for those who are not acolytes of Trumpism, including the persuadable voters he desperately needs to win back for re-election, this is turning toxic.



Add in news of an increasingly slouchy economy and you have perhaps the worst political run for this administration yet.



That’s not to say that it’s likely that Trump would ever be removed by the Republican-held Senate. The idea that 20 Republican senators would join Democrats in ousting Trump still sounds laughable.



But the president is certainly not helping his cause with a scorched earth strategy that provides no shelter for his less-fanatically-devoted allies.



Trump’s stance is that he did nothing wrong — again “perfect” — and that anyone who says so is part of the cabal trying to drive him from office.



That’s not going to cut it for lawmakers, especially for vulnerable Senate Republicans, as the 2020 election approaches. They need a space in between: Denunciation of dragging other countries into American politics while still saying Trump’s behavior doesn’t merit removal from office.



Bill Clinton’s team in 1998 knew they had to give Democrats a chance to denounce the president’s scuzzy behavior. Those denunciations actually strengthened Clinton’s standing in the Senate and with voters. He was being punished, formally and informally, and so wasn’t getting away with it. It helped turn him into a sympathetic figure.



Trump and his party are right now a long way from anything like that.



THE RULEBOOK: SERIOUS STUFF

“There is hardly any part of the system which could have been attended with greater difficulty in the arrangement of it than [the executive department]; and there is, perhaps, none which has been inveighed against with less candor or criticised with less judgment.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 67



TIME OUT: BON APPÉTIT, Y’ALL

Garden&Gun: “Nearly any Southerner who grew up in the country—whether on one acre or ten thousand—has seen the damage feral hogs do, trampling and uprooting crops and native plants alike. Raised in a North Texas cattle-ranching family, Taylor Hall experienced firsthand the destruction—and one potential solution. ‘Some of the cowboys I worked with would kill them for pig roasts, gumbo, and so forth,’ he says. … Hall kicked around California kitchens before returning home to open his own restaurant, Apis, in the hills outside Austin. A must for his menu: wild pig. … Hall compares the meat with beef. ‘It’s a lot darker because it’s an animal that moves around a lot, so there’s more blood in its muscles. And with that, you’re going to get more of that iron-y, metallic flavor.’ At Apis, Hall cures the meat for charcuterie and grinds it to make a traditional, slow-cooked Italian ragù, a.k.a. Sunday gravy.”

WARREN, SANDERS LAP BIDEN IN THIRD QUARTER FUNDRAISING

Politico: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign said Friday that it raised $24.6 million in the third quarter and has $25.7 million cash on hand, further solidifying her rise to the top tier in the Democratic primary. The haul bests the $19 million Warren raised last quarter but trails progressive rival Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose third-quarter total of $25.3 million is the biggest one so far from the Democratic presidential hopefuls. Despite neither candidate holding traditional high-dollar fundraisers, Warren and Sanders both significantly outraised former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg ($19.1 million), former Vice President Joe Biden ($15.2 million) and Sen. Kamala Harris ($11.6 million). Warren’s team was alone among those campaigns to disclose its exact cash on hand. … [Campaign manager Roger] Lau wrote that Warren added over 300,000 new donors in the third quarter, bringing her total to about 750,000 donors over the course of the campaign. Sanders' campaign said in September that it had accrued more than 1 million donors.”



Dem front-runners’ ages show larger issue for party - Politico: “Bernie Sanders’ hospitalization with a blocked artery this week finally forced the Democratic Party to confront a lingering fact: All three of its presidential front-runners are septuagenarians, and two are older than Donald Trump… For Sanders, the immediate effect of the incident — a blockage requiring two stents — was to sideline the 78-year-old senator until further notice… But the broader implications were also thrust into plain view: In a Democratic primary that was once expected to break along generational lines, a whole crop of younger contenders has fallen so far back that — even with an aging, top-tier contender laid up — it would take an upset for the party to mount a generational argument against Trump next year. Biden, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren — the youngest of the three at 70 — are pulling nearly three-quarters of the primary electorate’s support in national polling. And even if Sanders stumbles, no younger alternative is likely to benefit. Instead, it is Sanders’ friend and fellow progressive, Warren, who might be poised to gain.”



Harris struggles to gain ground in home state - LAT: “When Kamala Harris launched her presidential bid, she counted California as a major asset. … But rather than serving as a foundation, California is exposing the cracks in her troubled campaign. Recent polling shows Harris mired in a distant fourth place, with support from fewer than 1 in 10 of those surveyed. … In part, the poor standing reflects problems that have plagued Harris nationwide: uneven debate performances, a shifting stance on issues and, perhaps above all, the lack of a clear and compelling message. But part of the explanation is California itself. The state is physically immense… It’s also astronomically expensive to advertise, and that makes it exceedingly difficult for a politician — even one elected three times to statewide office like Harris — to become well known, much less revered.

Walter Shapiro: Pete Buttigieg’s undeniable allure - New Republic: “Four months before the Iowa caucuses, it is time to reckon with the reality that Buttigieg probably has a better chance to be the Democratic nominee than anyone aside from Biden and the surging Warren. With Sanders ailing and Kamala Harris sputtering, Buttigieg has enough money to go the distance (he has raised $44 million in the last six months) and enough polling support to guarantee his place on every debate stage. Whatever happens next, this youthful candidate with a long resume (Harvard, Rhodes Scholar, McKinsey analyst, failed statewide candidate, mayor, and intelligence officer in Afghanistan) has already emerged as the political surprise of 2019. And that raises a new question: Is Buttigieg, who would be four years younger than JFK if he were inaugurated in 2021, ready for the White House?”

THE REAL REASON THE CHICKEN CROSSED THE ROAD

Bangor [Maine] Daily News: “It all started around two weeks ago when [Kate] McCormick returned home from a day at Common Ground Fair… ‘I was really tired and I just wanted to go to bed,’ she said. ‘I lifted up the throw pillows [on my bed], and there was an egg under them.’ McCormick said all she could do at the time was laugh, and look for the nearest suspect. In this case, her 7-year-old German Shepherd-Labrador Retriever mix Jake. … Further investigation, however, revealed the culprit. ‘I started walking around my house and found little piles of chicken poo,’ McCormick said. … The next morning … McCormick was able to witness the hen’s antics first hand. ‘I was awake and the back door was open and before I knew it, I could hear a chicken walking up the stairs in my house,’ she said. … The entire process took around 15 minutes, McCormick said, since the chicken took the time to arrange the blankets and pillows into a sort of nest into which she laid the egg.”

The president's 2020 campaign and the RNC just announced a $13 million fundraising haul that came within 36 hours of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's inquiry.

Appearing on ""Fox & Friends"" with host Brian Kilmeade, McDaniel said: ""What this dollar figure shows is the energy with our base is strong. They recognize that Democrats are trying to nullify their votes. And, it is just bringing in so much enthusiasm, but also financial support for the president, which is allowing us right now to attack Democrats in their home districts.""

""They've been trying to impeach this president since day one. Democrats have never accepted the results of 2016,"" said McDaniel.

During the third quarter of this year, President Trump and the RNC brought in a whopping $125 million in fundraising. The 2020 campaign's fundraising arm said Tuesday that it has raised more than $308 million in 2019 and has more than $156 million in the bank.

Former President Obama and the Democratic National Committee raised just over $70 million in the third quarter of 2011.

2020 Democrats are also putting up big fundraising numbers, but not quite as large as the president's campaign.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders hauled in $25.3 million during the third quarter of fundraising, up more than $7 million from his second-quarter figures.

Additionally, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg's campaign reported Tuesday that they raked in $19.1 million over the past three months. However, that figure was down from the $24.8 million he brought in during the second quarter.

""The money coming in for this president is showing that we are well ahead. People know their lives are better and they are willing to put their money behind it,"" she told Kilmeade.

McDaniel said that the Democrats have ""done nothing since the president has gotten elected,"" pointing to the USMCA trade deal and that she's not worried about their campaign.

""Americans are looking at this as a total partisan attack against this president. I mean, you look at the phone call [with the Ukrainian president]. Anybody looking at the phone call knows there's nothing impeachable,"" she said.

""And, when it's only down party lines and Democrats from day one have refused to work with this president,"" McDaniel said, ""I think Americans are saying, 'Enough is enough. Why don't you get to the negotiating table and work on our behalf, instead of trying to negate the votes of 63 million Americans?""

Thanks to his policies, American families are more prosperous than ever before.

Real median household income in the U.S. – a reliable measure of middle-class prosperity – eclipsed $65,000 in July for the first time ever.

Remarkably, median household income has increased by more than $4,000 since Trump’s inauguration, meaning that the president’s pro-growth policies managed to grow the income of middle America by 6.8 percent in less than three years.

ROSE SOMMA TENNENT: TRUMP’S ECONOMY HAS DELIVERED REAL RESULTS FOR WOMEN. FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS ARE PROOF

That accomplishment is even more impressive when compared to the disastrous economic record of President Barack Obama, who was only able to raise incomes by a fraction of that amount over the course of a much longer timespan.

Under Obama, median household income only grew by about $1,000 between the end of the Great Recession in mid-2009 and Trump’s inauguration in January 2017.

The contrast dramatically underscores the extent to which government policy affects the day-to-day lives of ordinary Americans.

Obama’s heavy-handed, big-government approach to economic policy produced a disappointing jobless “recovery” from the Great Recession.

Trump achieved the lowest unemployment rate in half a century – as well as the fastest wage growth in over a decade – by removing obstacles to the success of American workers and businesses.

Trump’s most high-profile economic policy accomplishment, of course, is the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which saved the average taxpayer about $1,400 on federal income taxes last year. Notably, that’s in addition to the $4,144 increase in pre-tax incomes, meaning today’s workers have an average of an extra $5,500 in their bank accounts as a result of the Trump presidency.

Equally important, however, have been his less-noticed successes, such as slashing the burdensome and unnecessary federal regulations that proliferated under Obama and stifled entrepreneurialism in this country.

More impressive still, Trump has achieved all this despite relentless obstruction by the Democratic Party, which has been so obsessed with undermining his presidency that his signature tax cut bill passed Congress without a single Democratic vote – even though that one piece of legislation provided more economic benefits to middle-income Americans than Obama’s entire presidency.

After a decade of stagnation, President Trump has finally restored prosperity to America’s middle class – returning it to its rightful place as the engine of our economy and the envy of the world.

Of course, Trump’s unprecedented success in empowering the millions of formerly forgotten Americans who had been ignored for so long by the political establishment is precisely what makes him a political target in Washington. The Democrats are more concerned with winning the 2020 presidential election than with enhancing the well-being of working Americans.

CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM

That much is undeniable in light of the fact that virtually every Democratic presidential candidate is vowing to repeal the full range of President Trump’s rejuvenating economic policies and replace them with radical, big-government initiatives. These initiatives are taken straight from the Marxist playbook of unabashed socialists such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

The future of the great American middle class is in our hands. Prior to President Trump, it had been decades since working Americans had a true champion in the White House, and it could be decades more before another one comes along. We simply can’t afford to miss out on the opportunity for four more years of progress in the strong and growing Trump economy.

Now, former Vice President Joe Biden has been eclipsed by three of his rivals for their party’s 2020 nomination in the crucial race for campaign cash.

Democratic strategists say the ""devastating number"" is a clear warning sign for Biden as he battles to be his party's 2020 standard-bearer.

WARREN, SANDERS, FAR AHEAD OF BIDEN IN DASH FOR CAMPAIGN CASH

Even the candidate acknowledges the deficit.

“We haven't raised what a lot of people have -- we got started way later than everybody else, but we’ve raised, this last quarter, $15 million, in the middle of summer,” Biden said Thursday at a fundraising event in Palo Alto, Calif.

The $15.2 million the former vice president brought in during the July-September third quarter of fundraising was down more than $6 million from the $21.5 million he raised in the April-June quarter.

Perhaps more telling is the fact that it is far behind the $25.3 million that Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont collected in the past three months, and the $24.6 million that Sen. Elizabeth Warren raised. Warren, the populist senator from Massachusetts, has surged in recent months, in donations and surveys, and is now essentially tied with Biden for the lead position in most recent national and early-voting-state Democratic nomination polls.

For the second straight fundraising quarter, Biden was also outraised by South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who took in $19.1 million in contributions to his campaign over the past three months.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

“This is a devastating number for Joe Biden,” said a Democratic strategist who asked for anonymity in order to speak more freely.

With the kickoff primary and caucus voting just four months away, the strategist emphasized that “this is a time when candidates are supposed to be showing momentum and strength going into the early contests. This number shows that his operation is basically treading water and being left behind by more dynamic campaigns.”

Another Democratic consultant, who also asked to remain anonymous, warned that Biden’s fundraising figures “should raise some serious questions about whether Joe Biden has the chops to raise the money necessary to compete in a general election and whether he can excite the Democratic base that is giving is giving an enormous number of small-dollar contributions to other candidates.”

A longtime friend, adviser and fundraiser for Biden cautioned against reading too much into the third-quarter figures.

“I’m relatively happy with the Biden numbers. Obviously they could always be higher,” said Larry Rasky, who was a senior adviser on Biden’s unsuccessful 1988 and 2008 White House runs.

Rasky said that raising funds wasn’t “the top priority of the campaign” over the past three months, as staffers concentrated on building up grassroots support.

“I think the numbers give them what they need to compete and try and win in February,” he added. “Third quarter numbers are tough historically for candidates and a candidate like Joe who may not have as big a grassroots base as Sanders and Warren. But the number [will] get us there.”

And he predicted a more robust fundraising effort for the already-underway fourth quarter, spotlighting “it feels that way to me already. There’s more intensity as we start the quarter off.”

Biden has spent the better part of the primary season to date fending off attacks not only from President Trump, but from an array of primary rivals eager to take him down a peg. His poll numbers have remained strong in the face of it all, even as Warren's have risen. One question mark for Biden going forward involves his connection to the newly launched Trump impeachment inquiry on Capitol Hill.

Trump is under fire from Democrats over his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he urged Zelensky to investigate the Biden family over their business dealings in Ukraine. Critics say this amounted to seeking foreign assistance in a U.S. election.

But it's also cast a spotlight on the Bidens. Biden’s son Hunter served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned Biden's role pushing for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had been looking into corruption at the company (though the prosecutor was viewed by officials in several countries as himself corrupt).

While Biden denies wrongdoing, a recent Monmouth University poll indicated that 43 percent of registered voters believe Trump’s claim that Biden did pressure Ukrainian officials to keep them from investigating his son’s business ties, with 37 percent not buying the president’s allegations and one in five unsure. The survey also spelled trouble for Trump, with just four in 10 registered voters continuing to say that the president should be reelected, compared with 57 percent who say it’s time to have someone new in the White House.

Biden may soon have some outside help, however, as he battles for the Democratic nomination.

Reid calls it ‘gateway to the west’,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-harry-reid-calls-nevada-gateway-to-the-west-but-how-important-is-the-silver-state-in-2020,"LAS VEGAS -- Diversity. That’s what differentiates Nevada from Iowa and New Hampshire, and why former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., believes it’s crucial for any presidential candidate hoping to reach the White House to campaign in the Silver State.

“The reason I've indicated that it is so important that people come here -- there's no diversity in Iowa and New Hampshire. None. Here we've got what’s like the most of the rest of America,” Reid told Fox News. ""Candidates must realize that Nevada is a diverse state. It's different than Iowa. It's different than New Hampshire. It's a state that's very diverse.""

Many say that although Iowa has long been seen as the first litmus test for presidential candidates ever since Jimmy Carter was able to use it as a springboard that ultimately led him to the presidency in 1977 – it doesn’t represent the microcosm of diversity that is the United States.

EX-UKRAINE ENVOY KURT VOLKER TOLD LAWMAKERS HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT FORMER PROSECUTOR'S RELIABILITY, SOURCES SAY

Iowa’s population is 85 percent white and New Hampshire is 90 percent, while Nevada is a minority-majority state, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Although Nevada falls in third behind Iowa and New Hampshire in the national voting pecking order, the state represents the first chance for candidates to reach a diverse voter base that could prove to be an important bellwether in determining voter trends.

But the 2020 candidates don't seem to be paying much attention to the state. Top tier Democratic candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have only spent a handful of days in Nevada, compared to dozens in the other two early voting states.

According to Fox News data, Sen. Sanders has spent 10 days in Nevada, the most among the top three polling candidates, compared to 27 days in Iowa. Warren has spent nine days in Nevada, with Biden only visiting five times.

While it's a critical state, Nevada poses a challenge for candidates.

“They've all come here. I’d like to see them more, but I mean you have to understand that it's much easier to go to Iowa, much easier go to New Hampshire,” Reid told Fox News, adding that most of the candidates are from the East which makes it more difficult to get out to Nevada.

But, he noted, “they’re doing a pretty good job.”

Other than being racially and ethnically diverse, Nevada also has a large labor union presence, a critical voting bloc for Democratic candidates. Still, the candidates seem to be overlooking the state to save money -- and because, unlike the first two voter states, politics doesn't have the same fixation in Nevada.

""It really is a question of dollars and cents,” said Patrick Murray, director, Monmouth University Polling Institute. “Turnout is low. There is not a culture around the Nevada caucus like there is in Iowa and New Hampshire in terms of these voters really turning out, really getting engaged in this process early on.”

While Nevada represents a different voter base that is more encompassing of the nation as a whole, Democratic strategist Roger Fisk said if a candidate loses Iowa and New Hampshire the third state won’t matter.

BIDEN IS SPENDING $6 MILLION TO BLANKET EARLY-VOTING STATES WITH TV AND DIGITAL ADS

“If you come in fourth or fifth in Iowa you can maybe spin that and live for another day in New Hampshire, but if you’re coming out of New Hampshire fourth or fifth then you never had to worry about Nevada at all,” Fisk said, calling Iowa the “biggest slingshot in the world” and referencing former President Barack Obama’s 2008 victory that energized his campaign.

Murray agreed.

“They can spend all the resources saying Nevada is going be the place where they really break out, but if they tank in Iowa [and] New Hampshire, it really doesn't matter because they're done at that point,” Murray said.

On the flip side, both Murray and Fisk noted that if there is no clear frontrunner coming out of Iowa and New Hampshire, Nevada’s stock gets increasingly more significant – with Fisk adding that it could even “resuscitate” a campaign.

Local politicians said Nevada has more political importance than people realize -- and could make or break a presidential candidate.

Assemblyman William McCurdy II, chair of the Nevada Democratic Party, believes Nevada is that state that will ultimately “decide who the nominee will be” and who is “going to take on Trump in the general.”

“Candidates who have a statewide presence here, who are actually coming here more and more frequently, we see them being very, very strategic and focused on making sure that they're doing the work to turn out voters,” McCurdy II told Fox News.

McCurdy also noted changes to the caucus system to encourage higher voter turnout

“Our caucus is going to be one of the most expansive, accessible and transparent caucuses yet,” he said, adding that people will have the opportunity to vote early with preference cards translated in different languages.

That's an enthusiasm echoed by Reid, who has high expectations for 2020.

“I think 2020 should be really good because there's so much attention focused now. It's not two candidates. It's 10 candidates. And, I think we've had participation here that I didn't expect has been really very, very good. Even some of the so-called minor candidates are coming here all the time hoping they'll get a strike of lightning here sometime.”

Reid said Nevada will also play a critical role in the general election.

Although a September Fox News Poll has Biden leading President Donald Trump by 14 points, followed by Sanders at 8 points and Sen. Warren right at the margin of error, topping Trump by 6 points – Reid warns against ruling out Trump.

“My career goes back to a number of presidents and there's never been anything like Donald Trump. It's created a lot of anxiety in Nevada, the country and around the world … I have always said, 'don't count him out.' Even though he's amoral, he is a person who is always able to have a discussion on his terms,” Reid told Fox News, adding that “people think he's not very smart, I think he's really smart. He may not be well-read. He may not be very academic. But I think he has a sense of how to pick a fight.”"

TEAM TRUMP CONSIDERS APPEALING TO DEMS IN GOP DISTRICTS

WaPo: “White House officials intent on stopping the House from impeaching President Trump are considering appealing to moderate Democrats in Republican districts to stand with the president, a pursuit at odds with fresh political attacks from the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee. The nascent outreach campaign would target some of the 31 Democrats from congressional districts Trump won in 2016, many of whom ran on rebuilding infrastructure, improving trade deals and lowering the cost of prescription drugs, according to multiple officials familiar with the strategy. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely, said the appeal would be based on these Democrats’ 2018 election promises to work with the president — accompanied with a warning that impeachment would hamper possible legislative victories.”



Impeachment vets urge caution - AP: “But the Republicans who carried out President Bill Clinton’s impeachment in 1998 are unanimous in urging caution and restraint as Congress embarks on yet another impeachment struggle, this time over accusations that President Donald Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and Biden’s son. The impeachment veterans of two decades ago were thrust into a seismic political event that was sober and circus-like at the same time. So began a new, angry chapter of American politics that strained Washington institutions that were stronger then than now. … Today, those Clinton impeachment Republicans are urging a pause in the tribalism of the Trump era. … The best-known is Lindsey Graham, a former Air Force prosecutor who was among those most aggressively gunning for Clinton. … The most senior of two Clinton prosecutor remaining in the House is Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin... Clinton impeachment manager Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, wasn’t eager to take a walk down memory lane when encountered in the Capitol last week…”



Kraushaar: The impeachment bellwethers - National Journal: “All told, the numbers suggest that while the politics of impeachment hearings now favor the Democrats, the prospect of building enough bipartisan support to remove Trump from office remains remote. … It’s easy to expect the Republican base remaining solidly behind the president regardless of new information, but it’s hard to see how the broader politics improve for Trump or his party. Despite the partisanship, there are still many members of Congress whose perspective on impeachment going forward will be worth watching closely. They’re the bellwethers, the swing votes whose forthcoming reactions will reflect the mood of the country. There are four categories of members I’m closely watching: the swing-state Republicans, the red-state Democrats, the Republican retirees, and the swing-district freshman Democrats with national security experience.”



Jim Geraghty: Don’t obsess over whistleblower - National Review: “Here’s an assessment sure to be unpopular: When the story of the impeachment effort against President Trump is written, the whistleblower will be an afterthought or a minor player in the overall story at most. Either the whistleblower’s claims are accurate, or they aren’t. Impeachment will hinge upon whether President Trump’s actions strike lawmakers as an effort to effectively blackmail Ukraine into finding dirt on Joe Biden, or whether it’s just Trump being Trump, wanting the facts on Biden strong-arming a foreign government to fire a prosecutor who might have been investigating a company that employed his son. The vast majority of lawmakers’ conclusions on this will just happen to align with their partisan affiliations.”



Schumer continues to press McConnell - Politico: “Chuck Schumer wants Senate Democrats to keep the pressure on Mitch McConnell to hold a fair trial if impeachment of President Donald Trump comes to the Senate — but he also wants to keep whacking the majority leader for presiding over a ‘legislative graveyard.’ The Senate minority leader convened a conference call with his caucus on Wednesday to stay focused on its double-barreled messaging tactics while his 47 members are scattered across the country in the middle of a two-week recess, according to three people familiar with the call. … Schumer (D-N.Y.) urged his colleagues to not act partisan amid the impeachment inquiry and pressure McConnell (R-Ky.) to commit to a fair process if the House impeaches the president, according to a Democratic aide briefed on the call. … A second Democrat briefed on the call said some in the party are anxious for more strategic guidance from party leaders.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Trump attacks his own presidency - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains the Democrats’ evidence against President Trump and why he should present a principled defense if he has one: “Federal law defines as criminal the solicitation of aid – anything of value – for a political campaign from a foreign national or foreign government, whether the thing of value arrives or not. Federal law also prohibits bribery and attempted bribery, which is defined as withholding the performance of an official duty conditioned upon the personal receipt of a thing of value, whether the thing of value arrives or not. The law further prohibits intimidating witnesses, which is defined as the use of language designed to deter witnesses from giving testimony, whether the intimidation is successful or not.” More here.

Smithsonian: “With its cheery singles, theatrical medley and iconic cover, The Beatles’ 11th studio album, ‘Abbey Road,’ holds a special place in the hearts of the band’s fans. But as the album celebrates its 50th anniversary, few may realize just how groundbreaking its tracks were for the band. In [William D. Moylan’s] forthcoming book, ‘Recording Analysis: How the Record Shapes the Song,’ [he shows] how the recording process can enhance the artistry of songs, and ‘Abbey Road’ is one of the albums [he highlights]. Beginning with 1965’s ‘Rubber Soul,’ The Beatles started exploring new sounds. This quest continued in ‘Abbey Road,’ where the band was able to deftly incorporate emerging recording technology in a way that set the album apart from everything they had previously done. … ‘Abbey Road’ … shows how a song can be poetically written and an instrument deftly played. But the way a track is recorded can be the artist’s final stamp on the song.”

DEMS GRUMBLE OVER LARGE DEBATE STAGE

Politico: “The next Democratic presidential primary debate will likely be historic — but probably not for the reason Democrats were hoping. The Democratic National Committee announced Wednesday that 12 candidates have qualified for the Oct. 15 debate in Westerville, Ohio. And unlike the previous rounds, when the stage was limited to 10 candidates, which resulted in the first two debates being split into two consecutive nights, all 12 are set to share one stage on Oct. 15.This would make it the largest presidential primary debate ever, Republican or Democrat… Invited to the debate are: Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julián Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang. If none of the candidates drop out between now and the debate — and Sanders participates in the debate after his recent heart procedure — it will surpass the previous record of 11 candidates on a primary debate stage, set by Republicans during the 2016 cycle. The crowded stage is leading to some grumbling from Democrats, who are already conscious about their speaking time.”



Biden tries to fashion a Super Tuesday firewall - Politico: “Joe Biden’s campaign is ramping up its investment in Super Tuesday states, anticipating a Democratic race that narrows to two candidates by early March. The increase in staffing across the 14 states that will vote March 3 comes as Biden’s polling figures have declined and Elizabeth Warren’s have surged, particularly in states like Iowa and New Hampshire where she’s heavily invested in field organization. The former vice president’s campaign is still counting on strong finishes in the four early nominating states. But in the event of weaker-than-expected performances, a built-out Super Tuesday organization would provide a fail-safe for Biden. Many of the states on the Super Tuesday map — which includes a handful of Southern and Border states — play to his strengths among African-American voters and more moderate Democrats.”



Molly Ball: Harris remains an enigma to voters - Time: “Perhaps, in these days of brutal ideological combat, that kind of pragmatism could be sold as refreshing. But in Harris’ case it seems to be having the opposite effect. Some of the attendees at her events in Iowa told me they don’t think she’s progressive enough; others said she strikes them as too far left. ‘She hasn’t gone far enough to get the activists behind her, but she’s gone too far for some of the moderates,’ says Larry Gerston, a professor emeritus of political science at San Jose State University. ‘So she’s in kind of a no-person’s-land in terms of having a good base.’ And yet, polls indicate that Democratic voters still want to like her–if only they can figure out what she’s about. The race is far from over. Iowa voters are notorious for shopping around until the end.”



Klobuchar leans on family’s Iron Range roots - Roll Call: “If there’s proof of Klobuchar’s strengths as a candidate, it’s her margins in conservative parts of Minnesota. Despite Trump winning the 8th District — home to the Iron Range — by 16 points in 2016, and Democrats losing the seat last fall, Klobuchar carried it by more than 10 points in her 2018 reelection. But as Democrats have seen slippage in the Midwest, so has Klobuchar. Her margins last year in some conservative congressional districts were significantly lower than in 2012. Before she can try to extend that Minnesota success nationwide, she has to win over the Democratic Party base. ‘It would be unlikely,’ [University of Minnesota professor Larry] Jacobs said. ‘But I never give up on Amy Klobuchar. No one is going to outwork her.’”

AUDIBLE: THAT’S SOME PRETTY THICK BATTER

“There are different ways to bake the cake, depending on what sort of cake you want. Different flavoring, different temperatures, different ingredients yield different types of cake, and the president as the master baker is testing recipes and deciding what type of cake he wants.” – A senior White House official talking to the WaPo about President Trump’s freestyle solo approach to impeachment messaging.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I do enjoy reading the Halftime report and especially the From the Bleachers section where I can see how others are reacting to what they read. Your responses are usually spot on but [on Tuesday] I took umbrage to your calling the impeachment process ‘festivities’. While politics in general tends to resemble Battlebots and political conventions are certainly festive the gravity of what is taking place in Washington now should be handled with more seriousness. The potential removal of a duly elected president regardless of the outcome will leave wounds on this country that will take a long time to heal. We may not recognize our Republic when all is said and done due to the scars left behind. One can only hope that later generations can learn where we failed to, so that Impeachment, or the threat of it, is not used as a political tool every 4 years and never becomes something resembling a festival.” – Dave Fischer, Memphis, Tenn.



[Ed. note: I know that it’s very tempting to think the worst, Mr. Fischer. It not only seems more dramatic and historic than being optimistic, it also fits into the nation’s dour mood these days. I know it’s also tempting to take umbrage. In fact, umbrage taking has become sort of our new national pastime. The outrage olympics have overtaken our politics in a profound way. And while I do feel bad that you were offended at my jocularity, I am going to continue to decline to take politics so seriously. The issues at stake are too important to hang on every word of politicians. There’s no way around the partisan conflict ahead, but I still tend to think that there’s something better waiting on the other side. I’m grateful for your readership and hope you can stick with us despite my commitment to due flippancy.]



“Some are saying in the Senate trial, assuming the president is impeached, that the president’s attorneys will have the opportunity to subpoena and question anyone. By anyone, they’re suggesting Comey, Strzok, Page, Ohr, Holder, Lynch, Steele, Brennan, Clapper, not to mention Hilary Clinton… quite literally, anyone. It’s difficult to imagine that this is so, but, if it is, well, the country’s in for a tantalizing, and surely painful, show…” – B. A. Street, Colorado Springs, Colo.



[Ed. note: The Senate gets to make up its own trial rules. How long, how many witnesses, in what order, etc. would all be up for grabs if the House impeaches. I think the scenario you describe – weeks of confusing testimony going down alternate narratives, etc. – would be a bipartisan nightmare. Instead, I expect senators would prefer tight, concise presentations.]

WTAE: “An alligator was found in Pittsburgh Tuesday night, according to Humane Animal Rescue. The gator, which Humane Animal Rescue named ‘Gus,’ was found near the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh's Lawrenceville neighborhood. … George DeSavage and his girlfriend spotted the alligator. He said, ‘We were just down there sitting watching the sunset by the river and I happened to glance down and see it just sitting there.’ DeSavage said he wanted to save the animal and possibly prevent a dangerous situation for someone else. … He said grabbing the alligator was the right thing to do. ‘It was calm. It seemed like it was handled by somebody before because as soon as I grabbed it, it went kind of limp and calm and didn't squirm or try and fight or anything,’ DeSavage said. Police showed up and Gus is at humane animal rescue in Homewood.”

The Ventura County and Thousands Oaks sheriffs pulled officers out of an honor guard for the charity flag football tournament, forcing organizers to put the event on hold.

Appearing on ""Fox & Friends,"" Rosemary Zore, founder of the Robert L. Zore Foundation, said that the event was solely to unite the community and local law enforcement and was not going to be political.

""It's about remembering the hero, honoring the family, and uniting the community. We had an agenda. We told them everything that we were going to be doing,"" said Zore, who started her foundation to honor her father, a police officer who was killed in the line of duty.

TRUMP FILES LAWSUIT IN BID TO PROTECT PERSONAL, CORPORATE TAX RETURNS FROM RELEASE

The ""Blue Bowl"" was set to be held this month in honor of slain Thousand Oaks Sheriff's Sergeant Ron Helus. Helus, a 29-year law enforcement veteran, died in the mass shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill last year.

Thousands of dollars had already been raised for fallen officers' families, but the money is now being returned to donors.

Zore told host Ainsley Earhardt that they invited local and national leaders to the memorial and ""anyone of influence that would like to speak at the event.""

Trump-supporting singer Joy Villa was set to sing the national anthem. Villa's father was a military police officer. Actor Scott Baio, who had gone to church with Helus, also wanted to speak at the event.

""And, it's all to speak on law enforcement and law enforcement only,"" Zore explained. ""We do not bring politics into this. And, on September 14th we added Ronda Kennedy who is a local attorney. And, on September 16th, we got the phone call that they had issues with some of the speakers that we were having.""

""We were asked in the phone call: 'Isn't Scott Baio part of some right-wing group?' And, we were kind of taken aback by that,"" Zore said. ""The chief continued to say that these people do not represent the fabric of the community. That the Make America Great slogan is not popular within a 1,200-mile radius of the community. And that they...didn't want any Republican speakers there.""

Zore also added that Thousand Oaks Police Chief Tim Hagel said: ""Nothing good of this would come out of this event if we had these people speaking.""

Singer Villa called Hagel's response ""disgusting"" and that in all her years being an ""out conservative"" she'd ""never seen something so despicable like this.""

""This is not OK. This is prejudice, hello?"" said Villa. ""You're shutting down an event because of the way conservatives think, because I support the president?""

According to FOX 11, Mike Randall, the vice president of the Robert L. Zore Foundation, recalled the chief saying, ""The only thing you [could have done to make] this worse, Mike, was to invite Dick Cheney and Sarah Huckabee Sanders.""

""It was like blow to the stomach hearing that response because it was never political. It was made political when we got the phone call from Chief Hagel telling us that we were making it political,"" Zore said.

""It's devastating to me because we have all the right intentions,"" said Zore.

""I want everyone to come together. There's a war on cops right now, and it's terrible what's happening to our law enforcement and it's important for all of us to unite. No matter where you come from."""

* Reinforcing impressions that Donald Trump’s 2020 campaign sees Joe Biden as a threat, the president’s operation is launching a $1 million ad buy in early primary states, airing a new attack ad peddling a discredited conspiracy theory involving the former vice president and Ukraine.

* Speaking of Biden, the Democratic campaign announced yesterday that it raised $12.5 million in the third quarter. It’s an underwhelming haul, which is roughly half the money Sanders raised over the same three-month period.

* For his part, Biden is moving forward with a $6 million ad buy in the first four states holding 2020 nominating contests.

* At an official White House event in Florida yesterday, Trump discussed 2020 campaign strategy, went after Elizabeth Warren with his “Pocahontas” slur, and labeled Joe Biden “Sleepy Joe.” It served as a reminder that the president obviously has no qualms about blurring the lines of propriety ahead of 2020.

Appearing on ""America's Newsroom"" with host Bill Hemmer, Verma said President Trump's executive order – which would expand the program's private insurance option – is ""all about demonstrating his vision to protect and secure the Medicare program.""

In the executive order, the Trump administration claims his Medicare plan will:

Provide more plan choices and time with providers

Streamline approval of therapies

Reform link payments with value

Eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse

Reduce regulation

‘MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' SPONSOR SAYS PLAN WOULD GUT 1 MILLION PRIVATE INSURANCE JOBS

""He's just building on the tremendous success that we've already had with the program,"" she told Hemmer. ""President Trump's Medicare program is putting money back into the pockets of seniors. We've lowered out-of-pocket costs for drugs and for doctors' visits.""

She added that Medicare Advantage rates were announced at historic lows, citing lower Part D premiums and decreases in drug pricing.

Medicare itself remains popular, but 2020 Democratic presidential candidates' calls to enact a single-payer, government-run system for everyone are far more controversial. Speaking to a retirement community in Florida on Thursday, the president said Democrats want to ""raid Medicare to fund the idea of socialism.""

""All of the Democrats' plans would totally devastate our health care plans,"" he exclaimed.

Sanders' ""single-payer"" approach would cover people of any age and would incorporate the Medicare program. Private health insurance, including the Medicare Advantage option used by about one-third of seniors, would no longer have a role.

Sanders, who underwent a heart procedure this week, has argued that ""Medicare-for-all"" would offer seniors broader benefits and lower costs.

""In all of these versions, whether it's 'Medicare-for-all' or the public option ... what they're talking about is a government takeover of our private health care system stripping 180 million Americans from private coverage and putting them into a government-run program,"" Verma explained.

""What we've seen from other countries that have tried these socialist experiments is that that leads to reductions in care, reduced access, long wait times, and rationing of care,"" she said.

The figure affirms the momentum Warren has appeared to be gaining in recent weeks and months, as polls show her now battling Biden – once the unrivaled front-runner – for the primary lead.

While Sanders remains in third position in many polls, his fundraising is unmatched, totaling $25.3 million in the third quarter.

BIDEN RAISES $15.2 MILLION IN THIRD QUARTER, DOWN $6 MILLION FROM APRIL-JUNE HAUL

But Warren's campaign cash number comes close — and is far ahead of the $15.2 million raised by Biden in the last quarter.

Warren and Biden are essentially tied for the lead position in most recent national and early-voting-state Democratic nomination polls.

The Massachusetts senator, who’s produced one progressive policy proposal after another, announced her fundraising figures on Twitter, saying, “I’m grateful down to my toes for every grassroots supporter who chipped in.”

“Together, we’re building a movement that’s going to put power back in the hands of the people,” she pledged.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Warren’s third-quarter haul is up nearly $6 million from what she raised during the April-June quarter.

Her campaign announced that they received 943,000 contributions from more than a half-million individual donors, with 300,000 of those donors giving for the first time. And they reported that the average contribution to Warren was $26.

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg reported raising $19.1 million this quarter.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California reported bringing in $11.6 million in the third quarter, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang hauling in $10 million, triple what he raised in the second quarter. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey announced he raised over $6 million.

Best-selling spiritual author Marianne Williamson said she raised over $3 million and Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado reported raising $2.1 million.

President Trump’s reelection team, meanwhile, blew past all of them. The campaign announced that it and the Republican National Committee combined had brought in a massive $125 million in the third quarter.

The Sanders campaign released statements from his treating physicians acknowledging Sanders was diagnosed with a myocardial infarction – commonly known as a heart attack.

“After presenting to an outside facility with chest pain, Sen. Sanders was diagnosed with a myocardial infarction,” the doctors, Arturo Marchand Jr. and Arjun Gururaj, said. “He was immediately transferred to Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center.”

Sanders' campaign announced Wednesday that the senator from Vermont was recovering after an emergency procedure Tuesday to repair a blocked artery and that campaign events were being canceled. On Friday, Sanders said he feels ""great.""

“I want to thank the doctors, nurses, and staff at the Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center for the excellent care that they provided,” Sanders said in a statement released by his campaign. “After two and a half days in the hospital, I feel great, and after taking a short time off, I look forward to getting back to work.”

Soon after, he posted a video on Twitter showing him standing at a Las Vegas park with his wife Jane

""I just got out of the hospital a few hours ago and I'm feeling so much better,"" Sanders said. ""See you soon on the campaign trail.""

Sanders and his wife both thanked people for their warm wishes. The candidate was expected to return to Vermont.

The candidate's doctors said Sanders is making “progress.”

“The senator was stable upon arrival and taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, at which time two stents were placed in a blocked coronary artery in a timely fashion. All other arteries were normal,” they said.

The doctors added: “His hospital course was uneventful with good expected progress. He was discharged with instructions to follow up with his personal physician.”

Sanders himself posted a message on Twitter Wednesday afternoon to reassure his followers that he was on the mend and to do some campaigning for his push for universal healthcare dubbed ""Medicare-for-all.""

The Yang campaign revealed this week that it had raised $10 million in the third quarter, which a significant jump from $1.7 million from the first quarter and the $2.8 million from the second quarter.

However, members of the #YangGang on social media took notice that Yang's fundraising efforts were left out by CNN and MSNBC.

In CNN's graphic that went viral, it showed Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., leading the pack in the third quarter with $25.3 million, followed by South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg with $19.1 million, then former Vice President Joe Biden with $15.2 million, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif, with $11.6 million, and lastly, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who raised only $6 million, an amount many critics pointed out was lower than Yang's.

""Maybe next time we should raise $20 million!"" Yang joked.

Yang's tone took a shift when a similar graphic from MSNBC went viral, showing Sanders, Buttigieg, Harris, and Booker.

""I’m pretty sure I should be on this graphic,"" Yang reacted.

MSNBC later responded, saying the graphic was made before Yang released his campaign fundraising numbers.

""In this election, in the last couple- I mean, maybe couple of months, certainly a few weeks, there's this whole conversation that has been coming up about electability focused on our campaign,"" Harris said. ""Is America ready for that?""

On the roster: Trump offers no off-ramps for Republicans - Time Out: Bon appétit, y’all - Warren, Sanders lap Biden in third quarter fundraising - The real reason the chicken crossed the road



TRUMP OFFERS NO OFF-RAMPS FOR REPUBLICANS

The news these days is pretty grim for the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress.



The central claim of the whistleblower who came forward to authorities was that President Trump was pressuring America’s Ukrainian allies for dirt on Trump’s chief political rival, Joe Biden.



It has not only been proven true, the president is now doing it right out in the open. He’s even added China to the list of foreign powers he wants to provide opposition research on the Democratic front runner.



Worse, newly revealed texts between American diplomats show that senior State Department officials believed that Trump was conditioning U.S. aid to the long-beleaguered former Soviet republic on the provision of anti-Biden goodies.



But in potentially the worst development so far, it is now alleged that Trump’s personal defense attorney was dangling the promise of an official diplomatic visit to the White House for the Ukrainian president in exchange for a public statement from the Ukrainian leader to investigate Biden and his family’s business dealings in Kyiv.



Team Trump is having some success in deflecting attention, discrediting the California Democrat in charge of the House Intelligence Committee (who’s doing a pretty good job of discrediting himself) and bringing increased attention to the younger Biden’s super-swampy business model.



But the damage is already done. Trump has admitted that the central allegations are true. He has been and is using his office for his own political advantage. All presidents do in more innocuous ways — Air Force One as campaign prop, “official” events as rallies, the White House as an extension of the campaign — but dragging diplomats and involving one of the most potentially dangerous parts of the globe is new.



For Trump loyalists who are in the shoot-‘em-on-Fifth-Avenue club, this is not a problem. They agree with the president that his conduct was “perfect.” They are also convinced that Trump’s predecessor did as bad or worse but was protected by the media. But for those who are not acolytes of Trumpism, including the persuadable voters he desperately needs to win back for re-election, this is turning toxic.



Add in news of an increasingly slouchy economy and you have perhaps the worst political run for this administration yet.



That’s not to say that it’s likely that Trump would ever be removed by the Republican-held Senate. The idea that 20 Republican senators would join Democrats in ousting Trump still sounds laughable.



But the president is certainly not helping his cause with a scorched earth strategy that provides no shelter for his less-fanatically-devoted allies.



Trump’s stance is that he did nothing wrong — again “perfect” — and that anyone who says so is part of the cabal trying to drive him from office.



That’s not going to cut it for lawmakers, especially for vulnerable Senate Republicans, as the 2020 election approaches. They need a space in between: Denunciation of dragging other countries into American politics while still saying Trump’s behavior doesn’t merit removal from office.



Bill Clinton’s team in 1998 knew they had to give Democrats a chance to denounce the president’s scuzzy behavior. Those denunciations actually strengthened Clinton’s standing in the Senate and with voters. He was being punished, formally and informally, and so wasn’t getting away with it. It helped turn him into a sympathetic figure.



Trump and his party are right now a long way from anything like that.



THE RULEBOOK: SERIOUS STUFF

“There is hardly any part of the system which could have been attended with greater difficulty in the arrangement of it than [the executive department]; and there is, perhaps, none which has been inveighed against with less candor or criticised with less judgment.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 67



TIME OUT: BON APPÉTIT, Y’ALL

Garden&Gun: “Nearly any Southerner who grew up in the country—whether on one acre or ten thousand—has seen the damage feral hogs do, trampling and uprooting crops and native plants alike. Raised in a North Texas cattle-ranching family, Taylor Hall experienced firsthand the destruction—and one potential solution. ‘Some of the cowboys I worked with would kill them for pig roasts, gumbo, and so forth,’ he says. … Hall kicked around California kitchens before returning home to open his own restaurant, Apis, in the hills outside Austin. A must for his menu: wild pig. … Hall compares the meat with beef. ‘It’s a lot darker because it’s an animal that moves around a lot, so there’s more blood in its muscles. And with that, you’re going to get more of that iron-y, metallic flavor.’ At Apis, Hall cures the meat for charcuterie and grinds it to make a traditional, slow-cooked Italian ragù, a.k.a. Sunday gravy.”

WARREN, SANDERS LAP BIDEN IN THIRD QUARTER FUNDRAISING

Politico: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign said Friday that it raised $24.6 million in the third quarter and has $25.7 million cash on hand, further solidifying her rise to the top tier in the Democratic primary. The haul bests the $19 million Warren raised last quarter but trails progressive rival Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose third-quarter total of $25.3 million is the biggest one so far from the Democratic presidential hopefuls. Despite neither candidate holding traditional high-dollar fundraisers, Warren and Sanders both significantly outraised former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg ($19.1 million), former Vice President Joe Biden ($15.2 million) and Sen. Kamala Harris ($11.6 million). Warren’s team was alone among those campaigns to disclose its exact cash on hand. … [Campaign manager Roger] Lau wrote that Warren added over 300,000 new donors in the third quarter, bringing her total to about 750,000 donors over the course of the campaign. Sanders' campaign said in September that it had accrued more than 1 million donors.”



Dem front-runners’ ages show larger issue for party - Politico: “Bernie Sanders’ hospitalization with a blocked artery this week finally forced the Democratic Party to confront a lingering fact: All three of its presidential front-runners are septuagenarians, and two are older than Donald Trump… For Sanders, the immediate effect of the incident — a blockage requiring two stents — was to sideline the 78-year-old senator until further notice… But the broader implications were also thrust into plain view: In a Democratic primary that was once expected to break along generational lines, a whole crop of younger contenders has fallen so far back that — even with an aging, top-tier contender laid up — it would take an upset for the party to mount a generational argument against Trump next year. Biden, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren — the youngest of the three at 70 — are pulling nearly three-quarters of the primary electorate’s support in national polling. And even if Sanders stumbles, no younger alternative is likely to benefit. Instead, it is Sanders’ friend and fellow progressive, Warren, who might be poised to gain.”



Harris struggles to gain ground in home state - LAT: “When Kamala Harris launched her presidential bid, she counted California as a major asset. … But rather than serving as a foundation, California is exposing the cracks in her troubled campaign. Recent polling shows Harris mired in a distant fourth place, with support from fewer than 1 in 10 of those surveyed. … In part, the poor standing reflects problems that have plagued Harris nationwide: uneven debate performances, a shifting stance on issues and, perhaps above all, the lack of a clear and compelling message. But part of the explanation is California itself. The state is physically immense… It’s also astronomically expensive to advertise, and that makes it exceedingly difficult for a politician — even one elected three times to statewide office like Harris — to become well known, much less revered. In short, as other presidential hopefuls have painfully learned, there is no such thing in California as a home-state advantage.”



Walter Shapiro: Pete Buttigieg’s undeniable allure - New Republic: “Four months before the Iowa caucuses, it is time to reckon with the reality that Buttigieg probably has a better chance to be the Democratic nominee than anyone aside from Biden and the surging Warren. With Sanders ailing and Kamala Harris sputtering, Buttigieg has enough money to go the distance (he has raised $44 million in the last six months) and enough polling support to guarantee his place on every debate stage. Whatever happens next, this youthful candidate with a long resume (Harvard, Rhodes Scholar, McKinsey analyst, failed statewide candidate, mayor, and intelligence officer in Afghanistan) has already emerged as the political surprise of 2019. And that raises a new question: Is Buttigieg, who would be four years younger than JFK if he were inaugurated in 2021, ready for the White House?”

THE REAL REASON THE CHICKEN CROSSED THE ROAD

Bangor [Maine] Daily News: “It all started around two weeks ago when [Kate] McCormick returned home from a day at Common Ground Fair… ‘I was really tired and I just wanted to go to bed,’ she said. ‘I lifted up the throw pillows [on my bed], and there was an egg under them.’ McCormick said all she could do at the time was laugh, and look for the nearest suspect. In this case, her 7-year-old German Shepherd-Labrador Retriever mix Jake. … Further investigation, however, revealed the culprit. ‘I started walking around my house and found little piles of chicken poo,’ McCormick said. … The next morning … McCormick was able to witness the hen’s antics first hand. ‘I was awake and the back door was open and before I knew it, I could hear a chicken walking up the stairs in my house,’ she said. … The entire process took around 15 minutes, McCormick said, since the chicken took the time to arrange the blankets and pillows into a sort of nest into which she laid the egg.”

The president's 2020 campaign and the RNC just announced a $13 million fundraising haul that came within 36 hours of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's inquiry.

Appearing on ""Fox & Friends"" with host Brian Kilmeade, McDaniel said: ""What this dollar figure shows is the energy with our base is strong. They recognize that Democrats are trying to nullify their votes. And, it is just bringing in so much enthusiasm, but also financial support for the president, which is allowing us right now to attack Democrats in their home districts.""

""They've been trying to impeach this president since day one. Democrats have never accepted the results of 2016,"" said McDaniel.

During the third quarter of this year, President Trump and the RNC brought in a whopping $125 million in fundraising. The 2020 campaign's fundraising arm said Tuesday that it has raised more than $308 million in 2019 and has more than $156 million in the bank.

2020 Democrats are also putting up big fundraising numbers, but not quite as large as the president's campaign.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders hauled in $25.3 million during the third quarter of fundraising, up more than $7 million from his second-quarter figures.

Additionally, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg's campaign reported Tuesday that they raked in $19.1 million over the past three months. However, that figure was down from the $24.8 million he brought in during the second quarter.

""The money coming in for this president is showing that we are well ahead. People know their lives are better and they are willing to put their money behind it,"" she told Kilmeade.

McDaniel said that the Democrats have ""done nothing since the president has gotten elected,"" pointing to the USMCA trade deal and that she's not worried about their campaign.

""Americans are looking at this as a total partisan attack against this president. I mean, you look at the phone call [with the Ukrainian president]. Anybody looking at the phone call knows there's nothing impeachable,"" she said.

""And, when it's only down party lines and Democrats from day one have refused to work with this president,"" McDaniel said, ""I think Americans are saying, 'Enough is enough. Why don't you get to the negotiating table and work on our behalf, instead of trying to negate the votes of 63 million Americans?""

It will not be applied retroactively to those already in the U.S. It does not affect lawful permanent residents, nor does it apply to asylum seekers, refugees or children. However, it would apply to the spouses and parents of U.S. citizens.

“Hospitals and other providers often administer care to the uninsured without any hope of receiving reimbursement from them,” the White House explained. “The costs associated with this care are passed on to the American people in the form of higher taxes, higher premiums, and higher fees for medical services ... The United States has a long history of welcoming immigrants who come lawfully in search of brighter futures. We must continue that tradition while also addressing the challenges facing our healthcare system, including protecting both it and the American taxpayer from the burdens of uncompensated care.""

Hospitals have spent more than $35 billion, or an average of $7 million per hospital, on “unreimbursed services” over the last 10 years, according to the White House.

“Beyond imposing higher costs on hospitals and other healthcare infrastructure, uninsured individuals often use emergency rooms to seek remedies for a variety of non-emergency conditions, causing overcrowding and delays for those who truly need emergency services,” the White House added.

Under the proposed rule, the required insurance can be purchased individually or provided by an employer, and it can be short-term coverage or catastrophic. Medicaid doesn't count. And an immigrant will not be able to obtain a visa if using ObamaCare subsidies when buying insurance.

According to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan immigration think tank, 57 percent of U.S. immigrants had private health insurance in 2017, compared with 69 percent of U.S.-born, and 30 percent had public health insurance coverage, compared with 36 percent of native-born. The institute also said the uninsured rate for immigrants dropped from 32 percent to 20 percent between 2013 to 2017.

Earlier this year the Trump administration issued a “public charge rule,” which will go into effect Oct. 15, allowing federal officials to deny green cards to applicants deemed likely to rely on government aid. Officials described the rule as a means to protect taxpayers and promote self-sufficiency among those granted permanent residence. Factors to be considered under the “public charge rule” are age, health, financial assets and education.

The White House also directed officials to recover income-based welfare payments from sponsors and proposed a rule requiring verification of immigration status for anyone seeking access to public housing benefits.

The new restrictions came as immigration and health care are at the forefront of the 2020 presidential race. Democratic candidates have repeatedly decried Trump’s strict immigration policies and most have touted ""Medicare-for-All"" or at the very least a public option for health care. Most have even taken it a step further and supported providing health care for undocumented immigrants. Trump mocked Democrats on Twitter who supported the idea at a Democratic primary debate in June.

“All Democrats just raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited healthcare,” Trump tweeted. “How about taking care of American Citizens first!? That’s the end of that race!”

Thanks to his policies, American families are more prosperous than ever before.

Real median household income in the U.S. – a reliable measure of middle-class prosperity – eclipsed $65,000 in July for the first time ever.

Remarkably, median household income has increased by more than $4,000 since Trump’s inauguration, meaning that the president’s pro-growth policies managed to grow the income of middle America by 6.8 percent in less than three years.

ROSE SOMMA TENNENT: TRUMP’S ECONOMY HAS DELIVERED REAL RESULTS FOR WOMEN. FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS ARE PROOF

That accomplishment is even more impressive when compared to the disastrous economic record of President Barack Obama, who was only able to raise incomes by a fraction of that amount over the course of a much longer timespan.

Under Obama, median household income only grew by about $1,000 between the end of the Great Recession in mid-2009 and Trump’s inauguration in January 2017.

The contrast dramatically underscores the extent to which government policy affects the day-to-day lives of ordinary Americans.

Obama’s heavy-handed, big-government approach to economic policy produced a disappointing jobless “recovery” from the Great Recession.

Trump achieved the lowest unemployment rate in half a century – as well as the fastest wage growth in over a decade – by removing obstacles to the success of American workers and businesses.

Trump’s most high-profile economic policy accomplishment, of course, is the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which saved the average taxpayer about $1,400 on federal income taxes last year. Notably, that’s in addition to the $4,144 increase in pre-tax incomes, meaning today’s workers have an average of an extra $5,500 in their bank accounts as a result of the Trump presidency.

Equally important, however, have been his less-noticed successes, such as slashing the burdensome and unnecessary federal regulations that proliferated under Obama and stifled entrepreneurialism in this country.

More impressive still, Trump has achieved all this despite relentless obstruction by the Democratic Party, which has been so obsessed with undermining his presidency that his signature tax cut bill passed Congress without a single Democratic vote – even though that one piece of legislation provided more economic benefits to middle-income Americans than Obama’s entire presidency.

After a decade of stagnation, President Trump has finally restored prosperity to America’s middle class – returning it to its rightful place as the engine of our economy and the envy of the world.

Of course, Trump’s unprecedented success in empowering the millions of formerly forgotten Americans who had been ignored for so long by the political establishment is precisely what makes him a political target in Washington. The Democrats are more concerned with winning the 2020 presidential election than with enhancing the well-being of working Americans.

That much is undeniable in light of the fact that virtually every Democratic presidential candidate is vowing to repeal the full range of President Trump’s rejuvenating economic policies and replace them with radical, big-government initiatives. These initiatives are taken straight from the Marxist playbook of unabashed socialists such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

The future of the great American middle class is in our hands. Prior to President Trump, it had been decades since working Americans had a true champion in the White House, and it could be decades more before another one comes along. We simply can’t afford to miss out on the opportunity for four more years of progress in the strong and growing Trump economy.

Now, former Vice President Joe Biden has been eclipsed by three of his rivals for their party’s 2020 nomination in the crucial race for campaign cash.

Democratic strategists say the ""devastating number"" is a clear warning sign for Biden as he battles to be his party's 2020 standard-bearer.

WARREN, SANDERS, FAR AHEAD OF BIDEN IN DASH FOR CAMPAIGN CASH

Even the candidate acknowledges the deficit.

“We haven't raised what a lot of people have -- we got started way later than everybody else, but we’ve raised, this last quarter, $15 million, in the middle of summer,” Biden said Thursday at a fundraising event in Palo Alto, Calif.

The $15.2 million the former vice president brought in during the July-September third quarter of fundraising was down more than $6 million from the $21.5 million he raised in the April-June quarter.

Perhaps more telling is the fact that it is far behind the $25.3 million that Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont collected in the past three months, and the $24.6 million that Sen. Elizabeth Warren raised. Warren, the populist senator from Massachusetts, has surged in recent months, in donations and surveys, and is now essentially tied with Biden for the lead position in most recent national and early-voting-state Democratic nomination polls.

For the second straight fundraising quarter, Biden was also outraised by South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who took in $19.1 million in contributions to his campaign over the past three months.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

“This is a devastating number for Joe Biden,” said a Democratic strategist who asked for anonymity in order to speak more freely.

With the kickoff primary and caucus voting just four months away, the strategist emphasized that “this is a time when candidates are supposed to be showing momentum and strength going into the early contests. This number shows that his operation is basically treading water and being left behind by more dynamic campaigns.”

Another Democratic consultant, who also asked to remain anonymous, warned that Biden’s fundraising figures “should raise some serious questions about whether Joe Biden has the chops to raise the money necessary to compete in a general election and whether he can excite the Democratic base that is giving is giving an enormous number of small-dollar contributions to other candidates.”

A longtime friend, adviser and fundraiser for Biden cautioned against reading too much into the third-quarter figures.

“I’m relatively happy with the Biden numbers. Obviously they could always be higher,” said Larry Rasky, who was a senior adviser on Biden’s unsuccessful 1988 and 2008 White House runs.

Rasky said that raising funds wasn’t “the top priority of the campaign” over the past three months, as staffers concentrated on building up grassroots support.

“I think the numbers give them what they need to compete and try and win in February,” he added. “Third quarter numbers are tough historically for candidates and a candidate like Joe who may not have as big a grassroots base as Sanders and Warren. But the number [will] get us there.”

And he predicted a more robust fundraising effort for the already-underway fourth quarter, spotlighting “it feels that way to me already. There’s more intensity as we start the quarter off.”

Biden has spent the better part of the primary season to date fending off attacks not only from President Trump, but from an array of primary rivals eager to take him down a peg. His poll numbers have remained strong in the face of it all, even as Warren's have risen. One question mark for Biden going forward involves his connection to the newly launched Trump impeachment inquiry on Capitol Hill.

Trump is under fire from Democrats over his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he urged Zelensky to investigate the Biden family over their business dealings in Ukraine. Critics say this amounted to seeking foreign assistance in a U.S. election.

But it's also cast a spotlight on the Bidens. Biden’s son Hunter served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned Biden's role pushing for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had been looking into corruption at the company (though the prosecutor was viewed by officials in several countries as himself corrupt).

While Biden denies wrongdoing, a recent Monmouth University poll indicated that 43 percent of registered voters believe Trump’s claim that Biden did pressure Ukrainian officials to keep them from investigating his son’s business ties, with 37 percent not buying the president’s allegations and one in five unsure. The survey also spelled trouble for Trump, with just four in 10 registered voters continuing to say that the president should be reelected, compared with 57 percent who say it’s time to have someone new in the White House.

Biden may soon have some outside help, however, as he battles for the Democratic nomination.

Reid calls it ‘gateway to the west’,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-harry-reid-calls-nevada-gateway-to-the-west-but-how-important-is-the-silver-state-in-2020,"LAS VEGAS -- Diversity. That’s what differentiates Nevada from Iowa and New Hampshire, and why former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., believes it’s crucial for any presidential candidate hoping to reach the White House to campaign in the Silver State.

“The reason I've indicated that it is so important that people come here -- there's no diversity in Iowa and New Hampshire. None. Here we've got what’s like the most of the rest of America,” Reid told Fox News. ""Candidates must realize that Nevada is a diverse state. It's different than Iowa. It's different than New Hampshire. It's a state that's very diverse.""

Many say that although Iowa has long been seen as the first litmus test for presidential candidates ever since Jimmy Carter was able to use it as a springboard that ultimately led him to the presidency in 1977 – it doesn’t represent the microcosm of diversity that is the United States.

EX-UKRAINE ENVOY KURT VOLKER TOLD LAWMAKERS HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT FORMER PROSECUTOR'S RELIABILITY, SOURCES SAY

Iowa’s population is 85 percent white and New Hampshire is 90 percent, while Nevada is a minority-majority state, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Although Nevada falls in third behind Iowa and New Hampshire in the national voting pecking order, the state represents the first chance for candidates to reach a diverse voter base that could prove to be an important bellwether in determining voter trends.

But the 2020 candidates don't seem to be paying much attention to the state. Top tier Democratic candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have only spent a handful of days in Nevada, compared to dozens in the other two early voting states.

According to Fox News data, Sen. Sanders has spent 10 days in Nevada, the most among the top three polling candidates, compared to 27 days in Iowa. Warren has spent nine days in Nevada, with Biden only visiting five times.

While it's a critical state, Nevada poses a challenge for candidates.

“They've all come here. I’d like to see them more, but I mean you have to understand that it's much easier to go to Iowa, much easier go to New Hampshire,” Reid told Fox News, adding that most of the candidates are from the East which makes it more difficult to get out to Nevada.

But, he noted, “they’re doing a pretty good job.”

Other than being racially and ethnically diverse, Nevada also has a large labor union presence, a critical voting bloc for Democratic candidates. Still, the candidates seem to be overlooking the state to save money -- and because, unlike the first two voter states, politics doesn't have the same fixation in Nevada.

""It really is a question of dollars and cents,” said Patrick Murray, director, Monmouth University Polling Institute. “Turnout is low. There is not a culture around the Nevada caucus like there is in Iowa and New Hampshire in terms of these voters really turning out, really getting engaged in this process early on.”

While Nevada represents a different voter base that is more encompassing of the nation as a whole, Democratic strategist Roger Fisk said if a candidate loses Iowa and New Hampshire the third state won’t matter.

BIDEN IS SPENDING $6 MILLION TO BLANKET EARLY-VOTING STATES WITH TV AND DIGITAL ADS

“If you come in fourth or fifth in Iowa you can maybe spin that and live for another day in New Hampshire, but if you’re coming out of New Hampshire fourth or fifth then you never had to worry about Nevada at all,” Fisk said, calling Iowa the “biggest slingshot in the world” and referencing former President Barack Obama’s 2008 victory that energized his campaign.

Murray agreed.

“They can spend all the resources saying Nevada is going be the place where they really break out, but if they tank in Iowa [and] New Hampshire, it really doesn't matter because they're done at that point,” Murray said.

On the flip side, both Murray and Fisk noted that if there is no clear frontrunner coming out of Iowa and New Hampshire, Nevada’s stock gets increasingly more significant – with Fisk adding that it could even “resuscitate” a campaign.

Local politicians said Nevada has more political importance than people realize -- and could make or break a presidential candidate.

Assemblyman William McCurdy II, chair of the Nevada Democratic Party, believes Nevada is that state that will ultimately “decide who the nominee will be” and who is “going to take on Trump in the general.”

“Candidates who have a statewide presence here, who are actually coming here more and more frequently, we see them being very, very strategic and focused on making sure that they're doing the work to turn out voters,” McCurdy II told Fox News.

McCurdy also noted changes to the caucus system to encourage higher voter turnout

“Our caucus is going to be one of the most expansive, accessible and transparent caucuses yet,” he said, adding that people will have the opportunity to vote early with preference cards translated in different languages.

That's an enthusiasm echoed by Reid, who has high expectations for 2020.

“I think 2020 should be really good because there's so much attention focused now. It's not two candidates. It's 10 candidates. And, I think we've had participation here that I didn't expect has been really very, very good. Even some of the so-called minor candidates are coming here all the time hoping they'll get a strike of lightning here sometime.”

Reid said Nevada will also play a critical role in the general election.

Although a September Fox News Poll has Biden leading President Donald Trump by 14 points, followed by Sanders at 8 points and Sen. Warren right at the margin of error, topping Trump by 6 points – Reid warns against ruling out Trump.

“My career goes back to a number of presidents and there's never been anything like Donald Trump. It's created a lot of anxiety in Nevada, the country and around the world … I have always said, 'don't count him out.' Even though he's amoral, he is a person who is always able to have a discussion on his terms,” Reid told Fox News, adding that “people think he's not very smart, I think he's really smart. He may not be well-read. He may not be very academic. But I think he has a sense of how to pick a fight.”"

Biden captures 41 percent support among Democratic primary voters (+6 points since July), Elizabeth Warren trails with 12 percent (+7), and Bernie Sanders gets 10 percent (-4).

South Carolina holds its Democratic primary February 29, 2020. It is the fourth state to vote in the nomination race and the first with a large African-American population.

The poll, released Sunday, shows Biden with large leads among blacks (+41 points), men (+31), and voters over age 45 (+38). Since July, his support has grown 9 points among blacks and 13 points among black men.

Warren is ahead among one group -- white voters with a college degree (+5 points), and comes close to Biden among white voters, trailing him by just 4 points.

Sanders is the top pick among voters under age 35, besting Biden by 9 points.

Hillary Clinton beat Sanders by 73-26 percent in the 2016 South Carolina primary.

When asked their second-choice candidate, Warren tops the list with 16 percent. When first and second-choice preferences are combined, it’s Biden at 52 percent, Warren at 28 and Sanders at 23 percent.

“Warren is a distant second even though she more than doubled her support since July -- and she would need to triple her support again to even get within striking distance of winning South Carolina,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican counterpart Daron Shaw. “But she is really in the delegate hunt here. The fact that she is the top second choice candidate puts her in a good position to gain momentum as the field narrows.”

Fifty-eight percent of South Carolina Democratic primary voters prioritize backing a candidate who can beat Donald Trump, up from 52 percent who felt that way in July. That’s twice the number saying supporting a candidate they like is more important (29 percent).

They also prefer a candidate who will build on former President Barack Obama’s legacy over one with a new and different approach (50-41 percent).

Biden dominates among those prioritizing beating Trump (+39 points) and those wanting to build on Obama’s legacy (+41). He has narrower advantages, although still commanding, among those wanting to back their favorite candidate (+15) and preferring a new approach (+16).

Some 83 percent of primary voters are dissatisfied with how things are going in the country today, and 78 percent favor impeaching Trump and removing him from office.

DRS. NICOLE AND PAUL SAPHIER: WHILE HEALTH CARE DEBATE RAGES, AN ASTONISHING 33% OF US AVOID SEEKING CARE

My children have cystic fibrosis, a hereditary life-shortening condition that impacts the lungs and digestive system. The disease makes it hard to process enough calories to survive and leads to life-threatening breathing issues. In the U.K. right now, the government-run National Health Service has delayed access to a drug my son has been on for more than two years. The drug, Orkambi, is one of the first of its kind, correcting the underlying cause of CF, not just treating the symptoms. Yet this spring, a 600 years' supply of the drug expired on shelves in Britain.

Why? Because the NHS refuses to negotiate in good faith with the manufacturer, Vertex, over the price it wants to charge. That means people with CF will continue to die waiting for a drug they know can help them.

A government-run system in which bureaucrats decide how much they will pay – if anything – and what should be covered will result in extreme health care shortages as doctors and services go away when what the government decides it will pay won’t cover actual costs.

Currently people with private insurance pay a little more than those on Medicare, allowing hospitals and doctors to stay afloat. Without private insurance, hospitals would lose $151 billion in annual revenue. No magic words from a president – “Presto, you’re covered!” – will keep the doors of a business open when costs exceed revenue.

And consider that increased wait times are a cause of death under government-run schemes. A Fraser Institute study titled ""The Effect of Wait Times on Mortality"" found that, between 1993 and 2009, up to 63,090 women died waiting for treatment in Canada. Considering that the population of the U.S. is about nine times greater than Canada, the death toll here would be greater.

With so many Democrats joining Sanders' “Medicare-for-all” bill, the coming breakdown in care is a clear and present danger for the ill, the elderly and the preborn.

A look at the government-run Veterans Administration further illustrates the problem. As USA Today reported “death rates, bed sores, ER wait times” are a problem at many facilities.

With so many Democrats joining Sen. Bernie Sanders' “Medicare-for-all” bill in full or in part, the coming breakdown in care is a clear and present danger for the ill and elderly and, in the current plans, the preborn.

The Democratic presidential field has been in lockstep on their health care machinations including full taxpayer funding of abortion. When she was still in the race, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said, “I don’t think there is room in our party for a Democratic candidate who does not support women’s full reproductive freedom.” That’s election code word for abortion in all nine months, for whatever reason and taxpayer funded.

Though polls show Americans do not agree with such extremism, that hasn't stopped Democratic candidates from going all in for Planned Parenthood and abortion.

Writing for Slate, William Saletan laid out the depth of opposition to taxpayer funding of abortion for pro-life and pro-choice Americans. “In every poll, a plurality of Americans opposes public funding of abortions. In every poll but one, that plurality is a majority,” he noted.

While money is no object in the current debate, it will be. The government accountants were astoundingly wrong in their assessments of the price tag for ObamaCare, which pushed many to go without care or to spend exorbitant amounts. After ObamaCare was passed, its “architect,” Jonathan Gruber, mocked “the stupidity of the American voter” for not perceiving how the law hid its true costs.

ObamaCare totaled $940 billion over a decade and covered nowhere near what ""Medicare-for-all"" would entail. Reasons reports that “organizations across the ideological spectrum have pegged Bernie Sanders' ... ""Medicare-for-all"" at around $32 trillion over 10 years.”

That kind of spending will lead to price controls as politicians and government bean counters take charge of medical decision making. It’s the kind of radical change that “Rules for Radicals” author Saul Alinsky could like. The mentor to the Clintons and Obamas advocated the tactic of pushing a substandard policy forward that would later be countered with what activists really want. “The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative,” he famously advised.

Isn’t happening now? ObamaCare was forced on Americans with full knowledge that a quasi-public and quasi-private system would not to work. Now, to fix what their party broke, Democrats are advocating for complete or near complete government control of health care.

A rational mind can look at the problems and call for innovation and compassion, but “Medicare-for-all” really means health care for some and rising costs for all. The most vulnerable will be sacrificed in the name of cost-cutting and in service to an agenda that devalues the vulnerable.

That gives Democratic candidates the lead in each of the possible 2020 matchups tested in a Fox News Poll of Wisconsin registered voters.

Joe Biden bests Trump by 9 points (48-39 percent) and has the only lead outside the poll’s margin of error. Bernie Sanders is up by 5 over Trump (45-40) and Elizabeth Warren has a 4-point edge (45-41). In each case, the remaining 13-14 percent of undecided/third-party voters is enough to shift the race either way.

Trump receives 41 percent support or less in each of the matchups -- well below the 47 percent he won the Badger State with in 2016. At the same time, none of the Democrats hit 50 percent.

The Democratic candidates mostly owe their advantage to women voters and those with a college degree. Trump does best among white men without a degree and white evangelical Christians.

“Wisconsin is a tough nut for Republicans and the president has an uphill climb,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. “He needs to reassure rural voters who are spooked by the tariffs while persuading suburban voters to buy into his low tax/pro-growth economic vision.”

Trump won rural voters by 27 points in 2016. They now back him over Biden by only 2 points.

By a 19-point margin Wisconsin voters think tariffs hurt rather than help the economy, and more oppose building a wall along the southern border by 10 points.

Those favoring the wall prefer Trump by 73 points, while those opposed go for Biden by 76.

Voters who say tariffs hurt the economy prefer Biden by a 61-point margin. Those who think tariffs help support Trump by 65.

Trump beat Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin by less than one percentage point, making him the first Republican to win the state since 1984. Ninety-two percent of Clinton voters back Biden, while 83 percent of Trump voters stick with him.

Currently, 44 percent of Badger State voters approve of the job Trump is doing and 54 percent disapprove.

Views are nearly identical on the direction of the country: 43 percent are satisfied with how things are going vs. 55 percent dissatisfied.

Almost half (48 percent) rate the economy as excellent or good, while slightly more (51 percent) say it is in only fair or poor shape.

Meanwhile, despite many finding Trump’s dealings with the president of Ukraine troubling (33 percent extremely and 12 percent very), a 54 percent majority says there is zero chance something about the situation would cause them to change their mind about Trump.

Forty-two percent want Trump impeached and removed from office, 4 percent say impeached, but not removed, and 45 percent oppose impeachment. More Republicans (90 percent) oppose impeachment than Democrats favor it (82 percent).

In the race for the Democratic nomination, Biden is the top choice with 28 percent support, followed by Warren at 22 percent, and Sanders at 17 percent.

Pete Buttigieg comes in at 7 percent, Kamala Harris 5 percent, and Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, and Andrew Yang get 2 percent apiece. All others receive 1 percent or less.

The Sanders campaign announced Wednesday that he is off the trail indefinitely after undergoing a heart procedure. The poll was conducted Sunday through Wednesday evenings.

More Sanders supporters strongly back him (75 percent), compared to Warren (61 percent) and Biden supporters (61 percent).

Biden’s strongest groups include moderates, white Catholics and voters without a college degree. Warren does best among college graduates and self-described liberals, and Sanders makes the top three largely because of voters under age 35.

More Warren supporters (64 percent) are extremely interested in the election than Sanders (60 percent) or Biden supporters (51 percent).

Democratic primary voters place far greater importance on beating Trump than voting for their preferred candidate (52-33 percent). They split, however, when it comes to supporting a candidate who will build on former President Obama’s legacy vs. one who will take a new and different approach (43-47 percent).

Biden is the top pick among those who want to build on Obama’s legacy and those who prioritize beating Trump.

Democratic primary voters favoring a new approach give roughly equal support to Biden, Warren and Sanders.

Applicants will be denied entry into the U.S. unless they have plans to be covered by health insurance within 30 days of entering or have enough financial resources to cover the cost, according to the White House.

The measure would take effect Nov. 3 and will apply to applicants for visas from abroad. It will not be applied retroactively to those already in the U.S. It does not affect lawful permanent residents, nor does it apply to asylum seekers, refugees or children. However, it would apply to the spouses and parents of U.S. citizens.

“Hospitals and other providers often administer care to the uninsured without any hope of receiving reimbursement from them,” the White House explained. “The costs associated with this care are passed on to the American people in the form of higher taxes, higher premiums, and higher fees for medical services ... The United States has a long history of welcoming immigrants who come lawfully in search of brighter futures. We must continue that tradition while also addressing the challenges facing our healthcare system, including protecting both it and the American taxpayer from the burdens of uncompensated care.""

TOP WARREN CAMPAIGN OFFICIAL FIRED FOR 'INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR'

Hospitals have spent more than $35 billion, or an average of $7 million per hospital, on “unreimbursed services” over the last 10 years, according to the White House.

“Beyond imposing higher costs on hospitals and other healthcare infrastructure, uninsured individuals often use emergency rooms to seek remedies for a variety of non-emergency conditions, causing overcrowding and delays for those who truly need emergency services,” the White House added.

Under the proposed rule, the required insurance can be purchased individually or provided by an employer, and it can be short-term coverage or catastrophic. Medicaid doesn't count. And an immigrant will not be able to obtain a visa if using ObamaCare subsidies when buying insurance.

BERNIE SANDERS RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL, DOCTORS SAY HE SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK

According to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan immigration think tank, 57 percent of U.S. immigrants had private health insurance in 2017, compared with 69 percent of U.S.-born, and 30 percent had public health insurance coverage, compared with 36 percent of native-born. The institute also said the uninsured rate for immigrants dropped from 32 percent to 20 percent between 2013 to 2017.

Earlier this year the Trump administration issued a “public charge rule,” which will go into effect Oct. 15, allowing federal officials to deny green cards to applicants deemed likely to rely on government aid. Officials described the rule as a means to protect taxpayers and promote self-sufficiency among those granted permanent residence. Factors to be considered under the “public charge rule” are age, health, financial assets and education.

The White House also directed officials to recover income-based welfare payments from sponsors and proposed a rule requiring verification of immigration status for anyone seeking access to public housing benefits.

The new restrictions came as immigration and health care are at the forefront of the 2020 presidential race. Democratic candidates have repeatedly decried Trump’s strict immigration policies and most have touted ""Medicare-for-All"" or at the very least a public option for health care. Most have even taken it a step further and supported providing health care for undocumented immigrants. Trump mocked Democrats on Twitter who supported the idea at a Democratic primary debate in June.

“All Democrats just raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited healthcare,” Trump tweeted. “How about taking care of American Citizens first!? That’s the end of that race!”

Speaking at a Service Employees International Union (SEIU) summit, the 2020 presidential primary contender continued his strategy of pushing back against Trump’s allegations and what his campaign has called the president’s “unprecedented abuse of power.”

""Have you ever seen -- rhetorical question -- a president ever so unhinged as this guy is?"" the Democrat asked Sunday.

While Biden and Trump have been at odds long before the former vice president entered the 2020 presidential race, the animosity between the two has heated following the whistleblower complaint that claimed Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, and threatened to withhold military aid if the Ukrainians did not follow through.

TRUMP FIRES BROADSIDE AT 'PILLAGING' BIDENS, CLAIMS UKRAINE PUSH WAS ONLY ABOUT 'CORRUPTION'

Trump has accused Hunter Biden of improper activity related to his business dealings with energy company Burisma Holdings and claimed his father used his office to pressure the Ukrainian government into firing top prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma.

The former vice president has acknowledged publicly that he pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin but denied it had any relation to his son’s business dealings in the country. Biden said his actions were in line with pressure from other foreign leaders to fire the prosecutor.

“We weren’t pressing Ukraine to get rid of a tough prosecutor. We were pursuing Ukraine to replace a weak prosecutor who wouldn’t do the job,” Biden said this past Wednesday of an Obama administration policy supported by other Western governments that viewed Shokin as incompetent or perhaps corrupt.

The U.S. also had support internationally for its opposition to Shokin. Ukrainian officials, including Shokin’s successor, have said since that the Bidens were never implicated in any wrongdoing.

Biden’s “unhinged” comment came amid a challenging weekend for the Trump administration as reports emerged that a second whistleblower – this one with firsthand knowledge of the phone call between Trump and Zelensky – has spoken to the intelligence community’s inspector general.

The first whistleblower was subjected to criticism from Trump and his supporters based on an apparent lack of direct knowledge of the president’s conversation with Zelensky, as well as what Trump has called an inaccurate description of the call.

The new whistleblower also faced the ire of Trump, who has been even more active on social media over the weekend than normal. Targets of his social-media attacks included House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah.

“The first so-called second hand information “Whistleblower” got my phone conversation almost completely wrong, so now word is they are going to the bench and another “Whistleblower” is coming in from the Deep State, also with second hand info, Trump tweeted. “Meet with Shifty. Keep them coming!”

Biden held a nine-point advantage over Trump in the crucial swing state of Wisconsin, according to a Fox News poll out Sunday.

In each case, the remaining 13-14 percent of undecided/third-party voters was enough to shift the race either way.

Bernie Sanders is once again taking aim at corporate cash in politics – and, this time, the Democratic National Committee is one of his targets.

The Democratic presidential candidate – at home in Vermont and resting after suffering a heart attack last week – on Monday unveiled a plan to get big business dollars out of campaign politics by vowing to ban all corporate PAC contributions to the 2020 Democratic convention if he wins the party’s presidential nomination.

SANDERS RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL; DOCTORS SAY HE SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK

The Sanders campaign – in an email announcing the proposal – noted that 17 corporate donors funded three-quarters of the 2016 Democratic National Convention, with companies including AT&T, Microsoft and Chevron donating millions of dollars.

“In 2016, the fundraising committee for the DNC was led by an insurance executive and a Comcast executive,” said Sanders, who famously sparred with party bosses during his last primary run against establishment favorite Hillary Clinton, as he introduced his plan. “Currently, some Committee chairs work as CEOs and board members for large health care lobbying groups, and companies such as Comcast. Under my administration, the DNC will no longer accept corporate money.”

The Democratic National Convention Committee confirmed to Fox News that there are no plans to return resources that have already been contributed.

If elected and if his plan is enacted, Sanders said as president he would also ban all corporate donations for inaugural events and cap individual donations at $500.

And the senator vowed he’d “abolish the now-worthless FEC” (Federal Election Commission) and replace it with “a true law enforcement agency originally proposed by former Senators John McCain and Russ Feingold.” Sanders said his aim is to remove “greed-fueled, corrupt corporate influence over elections, national party convention, and presidential inaugurations.”

The plan’s release comes three days after Sanders was discharged from the hospital after suffering a heart attack last week. With the candidate off the trail, campaign co-chairs Rep. Ro Khana of California and San Juan, Puerto Rico Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz campaigned in Iowa and New Hampshire this past weekend.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

The proposal’s unveiling comes six days after Sanders raised an impressive $25.3 million in the July-September third quarter of fundraising, the most of any Democratic presidential contender. Sanders’ haul came almost entirely from small-dollar donors."

VARNEY: BERNIE SANDERS' HOSPITALIZATION MAY TIP DEM NOMINATION TO WARREN

Discussing the latest developments on his Fox Nation show, ""My Take,"" Varney said Democrats are scrambling in fear as they begin to realize ""that none of them can beat Donald Trump"" -- and he believes Americans will stick with the president despite an open impeachment investigation.

""For the 2020 Democratic hopefuls, it is in my opinion, a Monday mess,"" Varney said. ""There's mounting anxiety that none of the Democratic candidates can launch a campaign that will beat Donald Trump.""

""Of course,"" Varney continued, ""if you scan the news of the day, you'd think the world turns on impeachment, you'd think the Trump presidency is on its last legs...that's the media's never-ending obsession. Look beneath the screaming headlines, and it's the Democrats' presidential campaigns that are in real trouble.""

VARNEY: HONG KONG ENGAGED IN URBAN WARFARE

Delving into the Democratic frontrunners, Varney responded to 2020 candidate Joe Biden's recent statement, in which he wrote that he intends to ""beat Trump like a drum"" in 2020.

Biden has had trouble collecting donations recently, Varney said, after he found himself in the middle of the investigation against President Trump over the content of a phone call during which Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine.

""He is a casualty of the impeachment, he is collateral damage,"" said Varney in an earlier interview.

Varney then turned to Bernie Sanders, who recently took a break from the campaign trail after he ended up in the hospital with heart complications and underwent an emergency procedure to repair a blocked artery, according to his campaign. It was later disclosed that he had suffered a heart attack.

Varney argued that Sanders' hospital visit lends credence to those questioning whether his age will get in the way of securing a spot in the Oval Office.

BERNIE SANDERS HAS STENTS INSERTED AFTER DOCTORS FIND BLOCKAGE

""We wish the Senator well,"" he said, ""but voters have to be a little skeptical that a 78-year-old can return for a year of exhausting campaigning.""

As Senator Elizabeth Warren surges in the polls, Democrats ""who don't buy her far left-leaning policies"" are becoming increasingly alarmed, Varney said.

WARREN FACES NEW QUESTIONS ON CREDIBILITY

""Warren proposes a wealth tax, a lobbying tax, a corporate profits tax, a higher social security tax on the rich, a higher income tax, and a higher tax on gunmakers... Simply put, the calmer voices in the Democratic party understand that Elizabeth Warren is unelectable,"" Varney said.

""The top three all have their troubles and the rest of the pack has failed to break through,"" concluded Varney.

""Wouldn't you think that, with the President under impeachment threat, the candidates trying to succeed him would be powering ahead? They're not,"" he added.

""It's Trump who has raised the most money, it's the Trump base that is united. I'll repeat,"" he continued, ""eight days before the next debate it's a Monday mess for the Democrat hopefuls.""

The former vice president is ahead by 29 points, according to a Fox News Poll. That’s up from a 21-point lead in July.

Biden captures 41 percent support among Democratic primary voters (+6 points since July), Elizabeth Warren trails with 12 percent (+7), and Bernie Sanders gets 10 percent (-4).

The Sanders campaign announced Wednesday that he is off the trail indefinitely after undergoing a heart procedure. The poll was conducted Sunday through Wednesday evenings.

South Carolina holds its Democratic primary February 29, 2020. It is the fourth state to vote in the nomination race and the first with a large African-American population.

The poll, released Sunday, shows Biden with large leads among blacks (+41 points), men (+31), and voters over age 45 (+38). Since July, his support has grown 9 points among blacks and 13 points among black men.

Warren is ahead among one group -- white voters with a college degree (+5 points), and comes close to Biden among white voters, trailing him by just 4 points.

Sanders is the top pick among voters under age 35, besting Biden by 9 points.

Hillary Clinton beat Sanders by 73-26 percent in the 2016 South Carolina primary.

When asked their second-choice candidate, Warren tops the list with 16 percent. When first and second-choice preferences are combined, it’s Biden at 52 percent, Warren at 28 and Sanders at 23 percent.

“Warren is a distant second even though she more than doubled her support since July -- and she would need to triple her support again to even get within striking distance of winning South Carolina,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican counterpart Daron Shaw. “But she is really in the delegate hunt here. The fact that she is the top second choice candidate puts her in a good position to gain momentum as the field narrows.”

Fifty-eight percent of South Carolina Democratic primary voters prioritize backing a candidate who can beat Donald Trump, up from 52 percent who felt that way in July. That’s twice the number saying supporting a candidate they like is more important (29 percent).

They also prefer a candidate who will build on former President Barack Obama’s legacy over one with a new and different approach (50-41 percent).

Biden dominates among those prioritizing beating Trump (+39 points) and those wanting to build on Obama’s legacy (+41). He has narrower advantages, although still commanding, among those wanting to back their favorite candidate (+15) and preferring a new approach (+16).

Some 83 percent of primary voters are dissatisfied with how things are going in the country today, and 78 percent favor impeaching Trump and removing him from office.

In the most recent debate, candidates tried to out promise each other with their spin on government-run health care. By a show of hands, almost all of the Democratic candidates embraced some form government-run health care, which would destroy the private insurance market that serves more than 67 percent of Americans. In January, Sen. Kamala Harris said, “Let’s eliminate all of that. Let’s move on.”

I'm a mom, two of my four children have a lifetime medical condition. I’ve watched how children like mine suffer in other countries with similar government-run health care schemes. And it terrifies me.

DRS. NICOLE AND PAUL SAPHIER: WHILE HEALTH CARE DEBATE RAGES, AN ASTONISHING 33% OF US AVOID SEEKING CARE

My children have cystic fibrosis, a hereditary life-shortening condition that impacts the lungs and digestive system. The disease makes it hard to process enough calories to survive and leads to life-threatening breathing issues. In the U.K. right now, the government-run National Health Service has delayed access to a drug my son has been on for more than two years. The drug, Orkambi, is one of the first of its kind, correcting the underlying cause of CF, not just treating the symptoms. Yet this spring, a 600 years' supply of the drug expired on shelves in Britain.

Why? Because the NHS refuses to negotiate in good faith with the manufacturer, Vertex, over the price it wants to charge. That means people with CF will continue to die waiting for a drug they know can help them.

A government-run system in which bureaucrats decide how much they will pay – if anything – and what should be covered will result in extreme health care shortages as doctors and services go away when what the government decides it will pay won’t cover actual costs.

Currently people with private insurance pay a little more than those on Medicare, allowing hospitals and doctors to stay afloat. Without private insurance, hospitals would lose $151 billion in annual revenue. No magic words from a president – “Presto, you’re covered!” – will keep the doors of a business open when costs exceed revenue.

And consider that increased wait times are a cause of death under government-run schemes. A Fraser Institute study titled ""The Effect of Wait Times on Mortality"" found that, between 1993 and 2009, up to 63,090 women died waiting for treatment in Canada. Considering that the population of the U.S. is about nine times greater than Canada, the death toll here would be greater.

With so many Democrats joining Sanders' “Medicare-for-all” bill, the coming breakdown in care is a clear and present danger for the ill, the elderly and the preborn.

A look at the government-run Veterans Administration further illustrates the problem. As USA Today reported “death rates, bed sores, ER wait times” are a problem at many facilities.

With so many Democrats joining Sen. Bernie Sanders' “Medicare-for-all” bill in full or in part, the coming breakdown in care is a clear and present danger for the ill and elderly and, in the current plans, the preborn.

The Democratic presidential field has been in lockstep on their health care machinations including full taxpayer funding of abortion. When she was still in the race, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said, “I don’t think there is room in our party for a Democratic candidate who does not support women’s full reproductive freedom.” That’s election code word for abortion in all nine months, for whatever reason and taxpayer funded.

Though polls show Americans do not agree with such extremism, that hasn't stopped Democratic candidates from going all in for Planned Parenthood and abortion.

Writing for Slate, William Saletan laid out the depth of opposition to taxpayer funding of abortion for pro-life and pro-choice Americans. “In every poll, a plurality of Americans opposes public funding of abortions. In every poll but one, that plurality is a majority,” he noted.

While money is no object in the current debate, it will be. The government accountants were astoundingly wrong in their assessments of the price tag for ObamaCare, which pushed many to go without care or to spend exorbitant amounts. After ObamaCare was passed, its “architect,” Jonathan Gruber, mocked “the stupidity of the American voter” for not perceiving how the law hid its true costs.

ObamaCare totaled $940 billion over a decade and covered nowhere near what ""Medicare-for-all"" would entail. Reasons reports that “organizations across the ideological spectrum have pegged Bernie Sanders' ... ""Medicare-for-all"" at around $32 trillion over 10 years.”

That kind of spending will lead to price controls as politicians and government bean counters take charge of medical decision making. It’s the kind of radical change that “Rules for Radicals” author Saul Alinsky could like. The mentor to the Clintons and Obamas advocated the tactic of pushing a substandard policy forward that would later be countered with what activists really want. “The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative,” he famously advised.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

Isn’t happening now? ObamaCare was forced on Americans with full knowledge that a quasi-public and quasi-private system would not to work. Now, to fix what their party broke, Democrats are advocating for complete or near complete government control of health care.

A rational mind can look at the problems and call for innovation and compassion, but “Medicare-for-all” really means health care for some and rising costs for all. The most vulnerable will be sacrificed in the name of cost-cutting and in service to an agenda that devalues the vulnerable.

That gives Democratic candidates the lead in each of the possible 2020 matchups tested in a Fox News Poll of Wisconsin registered voters.

Joe Biden bests Trump by 9 points (48-39 percent) and has the only lead outside the poll’s margin of error. Bernie Sanders is up by 5 over Trump (45-40) and Elizabeth Warren has a 4-point edge (45-41). In each case, the remaining 13-14 percent of undecided/third-party voters is enough to shift the race either way.

Trump receives 41 percent support or less in each of the matchups -- well below the 47 percent he won the Badger State with in 2016. At the same time, none of the Democrats hit 50 percent.

The Democratic candidates mostly owe their advantage to women voters and those with a college degree. Trump does best among white men without a degree and white evangelical Christians.

“Wisconsin is a tough nut for Republicans and the president has an uphill climb,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. “He needs to reassure rural voters who are spooked by the tariffs while persuading suburban voters to buy into his low tax/pro-growth economic vision.”

Trump won rural voters by 27 points in 2016. They now back him over Biden by only 2 points.

By a 19-point margin Wisconsin voters think tariffs hurt rather than help the economy, and more oppose building a wall along the southern border by 10 points.

Those favoring the wall prefer Trump by 73 points, while those opposed go for Biden by 76.

Voters who say tariffs hurt the economy prefer Biden by a 61-point margin. Those who think tariffs help support Trump by 65.

Trump beat Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin by less than one percentage point, making him the first Republican to win the state since 1984. Ninety-two percent of Clinton voters back Biden, while 83 percent of Trump voters stick with him.

Currently, 44 percent of Badger State voters approve of the job Trump is doing and 54 percent disapprove.

Views are nearly identical on the direction of the country: 43 percent are satisfied with how things are going vs. 55 percent dissatisfied.

Almost half (48 percent) rate the economy as excellent or good, while slightly more (51 percent) say it is in only fair or poor shape.

Meanwhile, despite many finding Trump’s dealings with the president of Ukraine troubling (33 percent extremely and 12 percent very), a 54 percent majority says there is zero chance something about the situation would cause them to change their mind about Trump.

Forty-two percent want Trump impeached and removed from office, 4 percent say impeached, but not removed, and 45 percent oppose impeachment. More Republicans (90 percent) oppose impeachment than Democrats favor it (82 percent).

In the race for the Democratic nomination, Biden is the top choice with 28 percent support, followed by Warren at 22 percent, and Sanders at 17 percent.

Pete Buttigieg comes in at 7 percent, Kamala Harris 5 percent, and Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, and Andrew Yang get 2 percent apiece. All others receive 1 percent or less.

The Sanders campaign announced Wednesday that he is off the trail indefinitely after undergoing a heart procedure. The poll was conducted Sunday through Wednesday evenings.

More Sanders supporters strongly back him (75 percent), compared to Warren (61 percent) and Biden supporters (61 percent).

Biden’s strongest groups include moderates, white Catholics and voters without a college degree. Warren does best among college graduates and self-described liberals, and Sanders makes the top three largely because of voters under age 35.

More Warren supporters (64 percent) are extremely interested in the election than Sanders (60 percent) or Biden supporters (51 percent).

Democratic primary voters place far greater importance on beating Trump than voting for their preferred candidate (52-33 percent). They split, however, when it comes to supporting a candidate who will build on former President Obama’s legacy vs. one who will take a new and different approach (43-47 percent).

Biden is the top pick among those who want to build on Obama’s legacy and those who prioritize beating Trump.

Democratic primary voters favoring a new approach give roughly equal support to Biden, Warren and Sanders.

Washington insiders report that Democratic Party officials are also urging the former first lady to enter the race. They see Joe Biden’s campaign in free-fall, with polling and donations dropping, and they are panicked that Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren grows more inevitable by the day. Warren, they think, is way too liberal to win a national election. (They are correct.)

Hence, the overtures to Mrs. Obama, the most admired woman in the country, according to Gallup polls. And not only in the U.S.; according to a YouGov survey, Michelle is the most admired woman in the world. Admittedly, for that honor, she displaced actress Angelina Jolie, whom most would not consider presidential material, but even so…

MICHELLE OBAMA SAYS THERE'S 'ZERO CHANCE' SHE'LL RUN FOR PRESIDENT: 'IT'S JUST NOT FOR ME'

It must be tempting for DNC apparatchiks to look for a new Super Candidate. Notwithstanding the unprecedented number of 2020 contenders, the herd has thinned; the leaders today are no lock to beat President Trump.

Former Vice President Joe Biden is struggling. His money-raise in the third quarter was a pitiful $15 million, nearly $10 million behind Elizabeth Warren. In the RealClearPolitics average of polls, Biden’s line trends downward like a stock you don’t want to own. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/sc/south_carolina_democratic_presidential_primary-6824.html

Joe’s problems mounted (as I predicted) when Democrats jumped into full-impeachment mode. Their focus on Trump’s push to investigate Biden for corruption in Ukraine of course also brought scrutiny to his son Hunter’s lucrative job with Burisma, a local gas company.

That the younger Biden was paid $50,000 per month by a company whose founder had been under investigation for tax evasion and money laundering and that he won that post when his father was the Obama administration’s point person in Ukraine raises reasonable questions. There may have been no wrongdoing, but the episode is an unpleasant reminder that Biden has been a swamp dweller for decades, and swamp mud tends to cling.

Biden’s worst problem, however, is that he has not batted down Trump’s accusations more convincingly. In a recent front-page piece, the New York Times quotes Democrats who bemoan Biden’s response as tepid and worrisome; they see it as evidence he may not be up to the task of confronting Trump on the campaign trail.

David Plouffe, Obama’s former campaign manager, is reportedly “mystified” by Biden’s hesitance, saying the former vice president should “use this moment and become Trump’s opponent.” But, he has not.

Meanwhile, Warren barrels ahead, much to the dismay of moderate Democrats who admire her zeal but worry that with her far-left agenda she cannot win a national election. Warren’s appeal is strong among women, college-educated whites and young people, but she has yet to bring minority voters on board, and she also trails with whites without a college degree. She recently rolled out a lengthy pro-union program aimed at attracting blue-collar workers, but her embrace of “Medicare-for-all” and the Green New Deal has to date not won over that important Democrat cohort.

Hence, the search for a miracle outsider. But would Michelle Obama want to run? And, would she win?

The Obamas are enjoying life in the post-presidential fast lane, frolicking with billionaires and celebrities like Bruce Springsteen, Oprah, David Geffen and Richard Branson, celebrating their new-found freedom on yachts in Tahiti and elsewhere.

They are also celebrating their new-found wealth. Each has reportedly signed book deals worth $60 million, and signed a “high ten-figure” contract to help Netflix produce films. They recently plunked down $15 million for a beachfront home in Martha’s Vineyard; their net worth has been estimated https://www.businessinsider.com/barack-obama-michelle-obama-net-worth-2018-7 to be between at $40 million and $135 million.

Would Michelle give that up? She says no; she has twice declared publicly she would not run. She must know that campaigning against Trump would be ugly, no matter her credentials or popularity.

Past controversies will dog her, like this remark in 2008: “For the first time in my adult life, I am really proud of my country…” Critics will again scrutinize her Princeton thesis; her kids will once more be thrust on the national stage. Running for president is a dirty business.

But there’s a bigger problem awaiting any last-minute entrant into the 2020 race. Bernie Sanders’ supporters are already angry, convinced they were cheated out of victory by the DNC in 2016.

Hillary Clinton blames Bernie (along with scads of other villains) for her 2016 loss, saying he did not campaign hard enough on her behalf. As a result, she claims, some offended Sanders supporters simply stayed home.

The same will be true in 2020 should the party try an end-run – only this time it will be both Sanders’ army and Warren’s fans who will be furious. Combined, those progressives are attracting 41 percent of Democratic primary voters. That large group will be loath to give up their crusade. Sure, Michelle is popular, but will she adopt their favored policies like the Green New Deal or open borders?

Also, it has been clear in recent months that President Obama’s star has faded. Numerous Democrat candidates have been quick to blast his TPP trade deal and even his signature Affordable Care Act, clearly convinced the Obama imprimatur no longer carries much weight with voters. As much as Biden clings to his relationship with the former president, the less it seems to matter.

Maybe that’s because Democrats now concede that the former president demolished their party; under his leadership, Democrats lost 18 governorships and 816 state legislative seats, 12 seats in the U.S. Senate seats and 64 in the House. Obama left the party politically and financially bankrupt.

Because of those Obama-era losses, President Trump has been able to enact tax and regulation reforms, and appoint hundreds of judges and two Associate Justices of the Supreme Court. Do Democrats really want to travel down that road again?

Middle-class incomes surging – thanks to Trump policies,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/steve-moore-democrats-are-wrong-middle-class-incomes-surging-thanks-to-trump-policies,"The latest Census Bureau Current Population Survey data now show that middle-class incomes, after adjusting for inflation, have surged by $5,003 since Donald Trump became president in January 2017. Median household income has now reached $65,976 – an all-time high and up more than 8 percent in 2019 dollars under the Trump presidency.

This data was compiled by the statisticians at Sentier Research, an economic research group whose founders have more than 30 years of experience at the Census Bureau in analyzing the monthly income numbers.

I reported last week in the Wall Street Journal that real median family income had soared by $4,146 under Trump through July 2019. The just-released August numbers from Sentier show a huge monthly gain of $857 in income per household.

MIKE HUCKABEE: TRUMP ECONOMY IS DELIVERING HIGHER INCOMES AND RECORD EMPLOYMENT FOR AMERICANS

These numbers contrast sharply with the 16 years prior to Trump’s presidency. In the eight years that George W. Bush was president, median income barely showed any gain, up just $401 thanks to the deep recession of 2008.

In the seven and a half years that Barack Obama was president, and not including the end of the recession, which Obama inherited, incomes inched up by $1,043 (June 2009 – January 2019). This means that in the 16 years before the Trump presidency, incomes rose by about $1,500 while in less than three years middle incomes have risen three times faster.

The contrast is even sharper when measured on a monthy basis. The monthly rise in incomes under Bush was $4. That number was $11 under Obama and $161 under Trump.

These income numbers are PRE-TAX, so they do NOT include the impact of the Trump tax cut. The Heritage Foundation estimates that the average household has saved $1,400 a year on their federal taxes from the 2017 Trump tax cut. This means many working-class families now have a $6,000 higher after-tax, and after-inflation paycheck today.

These surges in income, especially in the last several months, have occurred at exactly the time when many liberal economists and media talking heads were shouting “recession.” In reality middle-class families were enjoying a near-unprecedented income windfall and “the gains in income levels in recent months,” Sentier reports, “have been accelerating.“

These surges in income, especially in the last several months, have occurred at exactly the time when many liberal economists and media talking heads were shouting “recession.”

These higher wage and salary incomes are no doubt related to the very tight labor market, which has given workers new bargaining power to ask for higher pay. Today there are more than seven million unfilled jobs in America – the highest number of surplus jobs in American history.

CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM

These latest income numbers also squarely contradict the claims by Democratic presidential candidates, such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who claim that all the gains from the Trump economy have gone to the rich and large corporations. Warren claimed earlier this year that workers had to work ""two or three or four jobs"" just to keep their incomes from falling.

No, this has been one of the biggest middle-class success stories in modern times, and it is a testament to the success of the Trump tax, regulatory and energy policies.

Speaking at a Service Employees International Union (SEIU) summit, the 2020 presidential primary contender continued his strategy of pushing back against Trump’s allegations and what his campaign has called the president’s “unprecedented abuse of power.”

""Have you ever seen -- rhetorical question -- a president ever so unhinged as this guy is?"" the Democrat asked Sunday.

While Biden and Trump have been at odds long before the former vice president entered the 2020 presidential race, the animosity between the two has heated following the whistleblower complaint that claimed Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, and threatened to withhold military aid if the Ukrainians did not follow through.

TRUMP FIRES BROADSIDE AT 'PILLAGING' BIDENS, CLAIMS UKRAINE PUSH WAS ONLY ABOUT 'CORRUPTION'

Trump has accused Hunter Biden of improper activity related to his business dealings with energy company Burisma Holdings and claimed his father used his office to pressure the Ukrainian government into firing top prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma.

The former vice president has acknowledged publicly that he pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin but denied it had any relation to his son’s business dealings in the country. Biden said his actions were in line with pressure from other foreign leaders to fire the prosecutor.

“We weren’t pressing Ukraine to get rid of a tough prosecutor. We were pursuing Ukraine to replace a weak prosecutor who wouldn’t do the job,” Biden said this past Wednesday of an Obama administration policy supported by other Western governments that viewed Shokin as incompetent or perhaps corrupt.

The U.S. also had support internationally for its opposition to Shokin. Ukrainian officials, including Shokin’s successor, have said since that the Bidens were never implicated in any wrongdoing.

Biden’s “unhinged” comment came amid a challenging weekend for the Trump administration as reports emerged that a second whistleblower – this one with firsthand knowledge of the phone call between Trump and Zelensky – has spoken to the intelligence community’s inspector general.

The first whistleblower was subjected to criticism from Trump and his supporters based on an apparent lack of direct knowledge of the president’s conversation with Zelensky, as well as what Trump has called an inaccurate description of the call.

The new whistleblower also faced the ire of Trump, who has been even more active on social media over the weekend than normal. Targets of his social-media attacks included House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah.

“The first so-called second hand information “Whistleblower” got my phone conversation almost completely wrong, so now word is they are going to the bench and another “Whistleblower” is coming in from the Deep State, also with second hand info, Trump tweeted. “Meet with Shifty. Keep them coming!”

Biden held a nine-point advantage over Trump in the crucial swing state of Wisconsin, according to a Fox News poll out Sunday.

Biden bested Trump by nine points (48-39 percent) and had the only lead outside the poll’s margin of error. Bernie Sanders was up by five points over Trump (45-40) and Elizabeth Warren had a four-point edge (45-41). In each case, the remaining 13-14 percent of undecided/third-party voters was enough to shift the race either way.

Trump received 41 percent support or less in each of the matchups -- well below the 47 percent he received when he won Wisconsin in 2016. At the same time, none of the Democrats hit 50 percent.

BIDEN STILL SLIDIN’

IBD: “Elizabeth Warren has taken a narrow lead over Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, the October IBD/TIPP Poll found. Both candidates continue to lead in a head-to-head matchup against President Trump, though Biden had a more comfortable lead, outside the margin of error. Elizabeth Warren had the support of 27%, with Joe Biden backed by 26% and Bernie Sanders a distant third at 10%. Support for South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg climbed to 7% from 5%. No other candidate polled more than 3%. The October IBD/TIPP Poll showed continued momentum for Warren. Last month's poll had shown support for Warren jumping to 24% from 17%. Meanwhile, Biden's support saw further erosion, after slipping to 28% in September from 30% in August. Sanders, whose nomination prospects could suffer after his heart attack last week, saw support fall after registering 12% the prior two months.”



Biden expands lead in South Carolina - Fox News: “Joe Biden increases his lead in the Palmetto State, as a growing number of South Carolina Democratic primary voters want a candidate who can defeat President Trump. The former vice president is ahead by 29 points, according to a Fox News Poll. That’s up from a 21-point lead in July. Biden captures 41 percent support among Democratic primary voters (+6 points since July), Elizabeth Warren trails with 12 percent (+7), and Bernie Sanders gets 10 percent (-4). … Kamala Harris receives 4 percent, down from 12 percent. Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July, also gets 4 percent. Cory Booker (3 percent) and Pete Buttigieg (2 percent) held steady. All others receive 1 percent or less. South Carolina holds its Democratic primary February 29, 2020. … Biden [has] large leads among blacks (+41 points), men (+31), and voters over age 45 (+38).”



Trump trails Dems in Wisconsin - Fox News: “Wisconsin voters are unhappy with how things are going in the country, oppose the border wall, think tariffs hurt the economy, and disapprove of the job President Trump is doing. … Joe Biden bests Trump by 9 points (48-39 percent) and has the only lead outside the poll’s margin of error. Bernie Sanders is up by 5 over Trump (45-40) and Elizabeth Warren has a 4-point edge (45-41). In each case, the remaining 13-14 percent of undecided/third-party voters is enough to shift the race either way. Trump receives 41 percent support or less in each of the matchups -- well below the 47 percent he won the Badger State with in 2016. At the same time, none of the Democrats hit 50 percent.”



Have you tried turning your campaign off, then turning it back on? - NYT: “At campaign events this past week, Ms. [Kamala] Harris debuted a fresh stump speech focused on the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump, an issue in which her campaign believes she is uniquely suited to lead as a former prosecutor. She began each of the rallies, titled ‘Dude Gotta Go,’ with a lengthy discussion of the president’s purported crimes, and concluded by talking directly about the idea of ‘electability,’ which she described as the ‘elephant’ in the 2020 race, and the fear that the country was not ready to elect a black woman as president. … In strategic terms, her campaign’s choice to pivot to Iowa is a concession that its initial theory of the presidential race was at least partially incorrect. From the start, her longtime advisers mapped out a national strategy that highlighted primaries with more diverse electorates … while conserving resources often used in early states for television advertisements in later ones.”



STEYER STICKING AROUND

Fox Business: “The wealthiest Democrat in the 2020 race, billionaire Tom Steyer, announced Sunday that he qualified for the November debate. Steyer is worth a whopping $1.6 billion. Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney is the runner-up with a net worth of roughly $200 million. ‘Tom is surging because he’s not part of the establishment and his message of ending the corporate takeover of our government is resonating,’ his campaign manager Heather Hargreaves said in a statement. ‘Tom is excited to continue getting out there and meeting with voters all across the country, hearing their stories, and connecting with them personally, and we are thrilled to see him on stage sharing his vision with the full country at the DNC debate in Ohio on October 15th and in November.’”



Sanders takes aim at DNC corporate donors in new plan - Politico: “Bernie Sanders, a longtime critic of the nation’s campaign finance system, is releasing a plan Monday aimed at ending the influence of corporate cash in politics, including at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. The Vermont senator pledges to put a stop to all corporate PAC contributions to the convention if he wins the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination. AT&T, Facebook, Independence Blue Cross and other companies each gave seven-figure donations to the event’s host committee in 2016. … His proposal also calls for a lifetime lobbying ban on Democratic National Committee chairs and co-chairs, as well as a prohibition on them working for companies that hold federal contracts or are trying to obtain government approval for mergers or other projects.”



Dem race becomes one of uncertainty - WaPo: “Interviews with more than two dozen Democratic leaders, top strategists and former elected officials revealed that most are still holding out judgment about how — or how much — the events will shift the race. But they point to several worrying factors [about Biden, Warren and Sanders]… Others expressed skepticism that any Democrat would be able to compete against Trump’s unmatched ability to shift the public’s focus. … The shifting dynamic has already altered campaign strategies, as some trailing candidates focus on early-voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire… But for the front-running trio, the events of the last two weeks have served as a public test of how they would handle crises in a general election.”



THE RULEBOOK: KEEP IN MIND…

“…it will be equally forgotten that the vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty; that, in the contemplation of a sound and well-informed judgment, their interest can never be separated…” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 1



TIME OUT: THE COMEBACK OF ‘THE NATION’S RIVER’

Smithsonian: “When George Washington chose to build his Mount Vernon estate along the Potomac River, he declared the then-pristine body of water ‘the nation’s river.’ At the time, even dolphins were a common sight. In fact, as Karin Bruillard at the Washington Post reports, the porpoises were seen as far upriver as Alexandria, Virginia, in the 1840s. But by the 1960s, the river that flows through the nation’s capital had lost its luster. … Now, after almost 50 years of pollution control, clean-up and restoration efforts, researchers have catalogued well over 1,000 bottlenose dolphins living, mating, and even giving birth in the lower reaches of the river. … Over the past four years, researchers from Georgetown University’s Potomac-Chesapeake Dolphin Project have been cataloguing dolphins in the lake-like area where the Potomac joins the Chesapeake Bay, reports Bruillard for the Post. … But the most exciting development came in August, when researchers witnessed a dolphin giving birth in the river.”

PELOSI RIDES TO RESCUE

WaPo: “A Democratic group with close ties to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is set to spend more than $1 million on ads set to begin airing this week aimed at bolstering a handful of vulnerable House Democrats as the impeachment probe unfolds. The ads from House Majority Forward, examples of which were reviewed by The Washington Post, do not mention the word ‘impeachment.’ Instead, they focus solely on the accomplishments of the 11 individual lawmakers targeted in the campaign. … The campaign represents the first tranche of television ads to be aired by a group with close ties to the party establishment. House Majority Forward is an affiliate of House Majority PAC, the largest Democratic super PAC focused solely on House races. The focus on non-impeachment issues is further evidence that Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Democratic leaders are aiming to sell a ‘walk and chew gum’ image for the party — that they can investigate and possibly impeach President Trump while also working to make progress on jobs, health care and other concerns.”



Team Trump sends Pence impeachment Dems districts - Politico: “The White House wants to make vulnerable House Democrats pay for impeachment. Starting this week, Vice President Mike Pence will embark on a national tour of congressional districts represented by Democrats who’ve come out in support of the inquiry. … Each of the districts on Pence's itinerary were won by Trump in 2016, making them potent targets for Republicans. The vice president will travel Wednesday to the southwest Iowa district of Rep. Cindy Axne, and Thursday he’s slated to visit the suburban Twin Cities district of another freshman Democrat, Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig. The vice president is then scheduled to barnstorm an array of battleground districts, including those held by Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger.”



McConnell uses campaign ad to flex impeachment muscle - Louisville Courier Journal: “Earlier [last] week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said his chamber would have ‘no choice’ but to hold a trial on whether to remove President Donald Trump from office if the House votes to impeach. But in a new campaign ad on Facebook, the Kentucky Republican makes clear that any impeachment attempt will fail as long as he remains in charge of the Senate. ‘Nancy Pelosi's in the clutches of a left wing mob. They finally convinced her to impeach the president,’ McConnell says directly to the camera in a 17-second video. ‘All of you know your Constitution. The way that impeachment stops is a Senate majority with me as majority leader.’ … The McConnell campaign, according to Facebook's ‘Ad Library,’ started running the digital ad last week…”



SUPCO BACK IN SESSION

Fox News: “Now, as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to launch its new term Monday, a 5-4 conservative majority could be poised to provide the White House with significant legal and political victories -- or setbacks. Such are the unusual dynamics now percolating from the nation's highest court. The justices' election-year agenda includes cases dealing with Trump's executive power over immigration, along with LGBTQ workplace discrimination, gun rights and abortion regulations. All are teed up to be argued this term, with religious liberty and health-care appeals good bets to be added to the docket. All will likely be decided in a presidential election year. ‘The court will be an issue in 2020 but that's perfectly normal. It was a huge issue in 2016, it helped get President Trump elected,’ said Paul Smith, a Georgetown University law professor who has argued 21 cases before the high court. ‘And it will be so again, precisely because it's become such an important part of our system.’”

AUDIBLE: HABITUAL LINE STEPPER

“We say, ‘Don’t cross this line.’ Okay, you crossed it. So, ‘Don’t cross this line.’ We’re finally at a point where patience is exhausted, reason is exhausted and, quite frankly, the voters are exhausted.” – Tom Rath, a longtime member of the GOP in New Hampshire, explaining the crossroads Republicans are at with the president right now, per the WaPo.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“A week ago (give or take a few days), you ran a lead article to the effect that over the months ahead you were going to soberly and impartially report the facts at every turn in the very ‘wine-dy’ (meaning curve-y) road to the 2020 election. Your lead article [Friday] entitled ‘Trump Offers No Off Ramps to Republicans’ strikes me (after the second reading) as anything but consistent with what I understood to be your sober and impartial mission. It seems that your article is strongly slanted against Trump from beginning to end. If I am wrong, can you explain what your ‘Off Ramp’ article would have to say in order to fail your criteria of impartiality, none-emotional, none-judgmental reporting and analysis? I'm genuinely baffled.” – Eric Hutchins, Santa Barbara, Calif.



[Ed. note: I gather from your sentiments, Mr. Hutchins that you are a political supporter of the president. And I understand that for the president’s supporters these are trying, frustrating, exhausting days. If one agrees with the president that his conduct relating to Joe Biden and Ukraine has been “perfect” then what’s happening now must seem like madness. But to most observers, the president failed in his duty by entwining domestic politics with foreign policy. It’s proving to be quite damaging. Now, I don’t care who believes what. You may think Trump hung the moon or you may think Trump is Old Scratch himself. Not my problem. What I promised you on Sept. 26 was that we would not obsess over minutiae from the day to day battle between the two sides over impeachment: “You have plenty of other options for getting the latest details on what this unnamed source said or what that hearing may or may not have revealed. We’re going to stay focused on the political repercussions because that’s our job.” I’m not sure how I’m supposed to do that and not talk about what’s happening in the news. The president is getting absolutely smashed over his conduct vis-a-vis Biden. Support for impeachment has jumped hugely. Republicans are in a defensive crouch and every day one of the president’s team seems to make another blunder that makes the situation even worse. It’s a political catastrophe. It may end up actually working out for Trump and the GOP. Democrats are making plenty of errors of their own and this may all blow up in their faces. And if it does, we’ll certainly be talking about it. But right now, the president and his core supporters don’t seem to understand what a pickle he’s put them in — and the huge problems he’s creating for the GOP. Trump had just gotten out of the woods on the Mueller probe and the very next day needlessly put himself in this jackpot. The position that the president has taken — the “perfect” doctrine — does not reflect the political reality for many members of his party. They need to be able to say that they disapprove, like Democrats did a generation ago, but think America should now “move on” from a divisive distraction. It’s none of my business who wins this fight. That’s up to you. But if you’re interested in my abilities as a forecaster and analyst, it will mean hearing things that you don’t always agree with and certainly discussing matters that are bad news for your team. But it will also mean that I will tell it to you straight. That I will be fair-minded. That I will listen and admit when I’m wrong. That I will give you my thoughts without fear or favor. That we will always do our best.]



“Chris, I’ll keep this short and sweet: 1. Where can I find the law that prohibits a candidate from getting ‘dirt’ on his political opponent from a foreign government? 2. Why is it against the law? Don’t I as a constituent have the right to know if a candidate has broken the law regardless of where the act was committed? 3. If you can never investigate a political opponent for deeds done in a foreign country, what’s to keep someone from simply committing all of their illegal acts in a foreign country?” – Meredith Shoemaker, Sugar Land, Texas



[Ed. note: The president mustn’t do such things himself. And he especially mustn’t do them when he would be the direct beneficiary. We have a Justice Department and a Department of State. We have federal police at the FBI. We have all manner of means by which to combat corruption here and abroad. But when it’s about his political opponents, the president must do his best to stay out of it. Doing otherwise diminishes the confidence Americans have in our legal system to provide dispassionate justice. Presidents of both parties have failed this test in the past so we know how real the temptation is. But it’s not something Americans want to become normal. That’s how governments operate in places like Turkey, Russia and China: People in power use that power to stifle their rivals. I know Trump believes the system is rigged against him, but he is still the president and he must find some way to better honor that high vocation or voters will surely throw him out next year.]



“Unforced errors are the worst kind of errors, in sports and everywhere else. I am reminded of Watergate back when President Richard Nixon was running for re-election. No benefit or advantage was gained from the break-in, and Nixon won re-election in a landslide anyway. Here now President Trump is trying to compromise Joe Biden as a candidate with actions that are expected to have substantial negative consequences for the incumbent – and for what? The race for the Democratic nominee is far from over, but Biden seems to be suffering from the ‘Curse of the Early Frontrunner’ and slipping in the polls for many other reasons than those that are being brought to light from any revelations out of The Ukraine. Hindsight, but also no small amount of foresight and experience, suggests that it would have been (and is) best to ‘keep your powder dry’ for whomever is the actual nominee and not waste time and resources going after those who will not be running against you. If Joe Biden is not the eventual Democratic nominee, this may well be one of those unforced errors that may even approach the impact and magnitude of the Watergate disaster. So much for learning from our past mistakes.” – Kent Haldorson, Beaverton, Ore.



[Ed. note: That’s a very interesting take, Mr. Haldorson. I’m going to chew on it for a while. If I write on it, it will be with due credit to you, sir.]

SO FRESH YOU CAN TASTE THE SQUEAK

Fox News: “And we thought mustard ice cream was a stretch. An ice cream vendor in Ecuador is reportedly seeing demand for her new — and arguably strangest — offering. It's made using the flesh of guinea pigs. Guinea pig meat, known as ‘cuy’ in Ecuador, is typically eaten as a savory dish there and in other South American countries, like Peru and Colombia, where it's often grilled and served whole, per NPR. But María del Carmen Pilapaña, who runs a small stall near the capital of Quito, has stumbled upon a completely new preparation — and it is a hit, she tells The Associated Press. … Pilapaña makes the ice cream by cooking down the guinea pig’s meat and making a pate of sorts before blending it with milk or cream, freezing it, and serving it just like she does with her other flavors.”

Photos and video showed Carter drilling screws into pieces of wood as he began work on one of the 21 homes scheduled to be built in a Nashville neighborhood.

Before construction began, Carter led a morning devotion for a group of several hundred volunteers.

Carter said God gives us life and freedom. ""With our freedom, every one of us can make a basic decision. ... 'What kind of person do I, myself, choose to be?'""

He said every person ""can be a complete success in the eyes of God.""

Carter, who served as the 39th commander in chief from 1977 until 1981, has suffered health issues over the last several years. He broke his hip after a fall in his home this past May and underwent successful surgery. He also survived a grim cancer diagnosis in 2015.

* Late Friday afternoon, Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign said the Vermonter was hospitalized following a heart attack in Las Vegas last week. There is no reason to believe this will derail the 78-year-old senator’s presidential campaign, though he is now at home recuperating.

* The latest Fox News poll in South Carolina shows Joe Biden with a sizable lead over his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination. The results showed the former vice president with 41%, followed by Elizabeth Warren at 12% and Bernie Sanders at 10%.

* Fox News yesterday also released its latest poll out of Wisconsin, where Biden leads Warren by a much narrower margin, 28% to 22%, with Sanders not far behind with 18%. The same survey showed each of the top contenders for the Democratic nomination leading Donald Trump in Wisconsin in hypothetical match-ups, with Biden enjoying the largest advantage (nine points) and Warren enjoying the smallest lead over the president (four points).

* The Warren presidential campaign announced late last week that it has fired its national organizing director, Rich McDaniel, after an investigation into “multiple complaints regarding inappropriate behavior.”

* As of this morning, it appears that Sen. Cory Booker and Tom Steyer have qualified to participate in the Democratic presidential primary debate in November, bringing the new total of participants to seven. In contrast, 12 candidates are slated to appear in next week’s debate.

* Biden wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post, responding to Trump’s offensive against him, and it concluded, “[T]o Trump and those who facilitate his abuses of power, and all the special interests funding his attacks against me: Please know that I’m not going anywhere. You won’t destroy me, and you won’t destroy my family. And come November 2020, I intend to beat you like a drum.”

* Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power told reporters on Friday that if Warren is elected president, Power isn’t ruling out the possibility of running for her seat.

* And in a curious tweet, later promoted by Donald Trump, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel suggested donor support is most important indicator of the president’s public standing, arguing, “Dollars are the real polls right now.”"

In the expected runoff, scheduled November 16, the poll shows Edwards leading Abraham, 53% to 38%.

* With Donald Trump slated to hold a rally in Minneapolis this week, there’s apparently a brewing dispute between the president’s campaign team and local officials over security costs associated with the event. It’s why Trump has spent much of the morning lashing out at Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey via Twitter.

* Speaking of Minnesota, Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s Democratic presidential campaign reported a third-quarter fundraising haul of $4.8 million, which isn’t great, but which is more than enough to meet the threshold for the party’s November primary debate. Klobuchar has not, however, yet met the polling threshold to participate in the event.

* The New York Times had an interesting item the other day on prominent members of the Republican Party’s “Never Trump” contingent who’ve since changed their minds. The article noted Erick Erickson, among others, who vowed, “I will not vote for Donald Trump. Ever,” only to recently change direction.

* With Sen. Johnny Isakson (R) stepping down in a couple of months for health reasons, Republicans are lining up to ask Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) to appoint them to the seat. Among the latest is former Rep. Jack Kingston (R), who lost in his Senate bid in 2014, and who last week reminded the governor’s office that he’s “aggressively defended President Trump at every turn” and “spent 30 years taking on the Democrats’ misguided agenda.”

* With only four weeks remaining in Kentucky’s gubernatorial race, the Democratic Governors Association is running this ad targeting Gov. Matt Bevin (R) for trying to derail the state’s Medicaid-expansion program, which is a story we discussed in some detail a few years ago.

* And in California, the latest Public Policy Institute of California poll found Elizabeth Warren narrowly leading Joe Biden, 23% to 22%, with Bernie Sanders right behind them with 21%. Kamala Harris is still running fourth in her home state with 8% support in the poll."

Bernie Sanders is once again taking aim at corporate cash in politics – and, this time, the Democratic National Committee is one of his targets.

The Democratic presidential candidate – at home in Vermont and resting after suffering a heart attack last week – on Monday unveiled a plan to get big business dollars out of campaign politics by vowing to ban all corporate PAC contributions to the 2020 Democratic convention if he wins the party’s presidential nomination.

SANDERS RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL; DOCTORS SAY HE SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK

The Sanders campaign – in an email announcing the proposal – noted that 17 corporate donors funded three-quarters of the 2016 Democratic National Convention, with companies including AT&T, Microsoft and Chevron donating millions of dollars.

“In 2016, the fundraising committee for the DNC was led by an insurance executive and a Comcast executive,” said Sanders, who famously sparred with party bosses during his last primary run against establishment favorite Hillary Clinton, as he introduced his plan. “Currently, some Committee chairs work as CEOs and board members for large health care lobbying groups, and companies such as Comcast. Under my administration, the DNC will no longer accept corporate money.”

The Democratic National Convention Committee confirmed to Fox News that there are no plans to return resources that have already been contributed.

If elected and if his plan is enacted, Sanders said as president he would also ban all corporate donations for inaugural events and cap individual donations at $500.

And the senator vowed he’d “abolish the now-worthless FEC” (Federal Election Commission) and replace it with “a true law enforcement agency originally proposed by former Senators John McCain and Russ Feingold.” Sanders said his aim is to remove “greed-fueled, corrupt corporate influence over elections, national party convention, and presidential inaugurations.”

The plan’s release comes three days after Sanders was discharged from the hospital after suffering a heart attack last week. With the candidate off the trail, campaign co-chairs Rep. Ro Khana of California and San Juan, Puerto Rico Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz campaigned in Iowa and New Hampshire this past weekend.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

The proposal’s unveiling comes six days after Sanders raised an impressive $25.3 million in the July-September third quarter of fundraising, the most of any Democratic presidential contender. Sanders’ haul came almost entirely from small-dollar donors."

VARNEY: BERNIE SANDERS' HOSPITALIZATION MAY TIP DEM NOMINATION TO WARREN

Discussing the latest developments on his Fox Nation show, ""My Take,"" Varney said Democrats are scrambling in fear as they begin to realize ""that none of them can beat Donald Trump"" -- and he believes Americans will stick with the president despite an open impeachment investigation.

""For the 2020 Democratic hopefuls, it is in my opinion, a Monday mess,"" Varney said. ""There's mounting anxiety that none of the Democratic candidates can launch a campaign that will beat Donald Trump.""

""Of course,"" Varney continued, ""if you scan the news of the day, you'd think the world turns on impeachment, you'd think the Trump presidency is on its last legs...that's the media's never-ending obsession. Look beneath the screaming headlines, and it's the Democrats' presidential campaigns that are in real trouble.""

VARNEY: HONG KONG ENGAGED IN URBAN WARFARE

Delving into the Democratic frontrunners, Varney responded to 2020 candidate Joe Biden's recent statement, in which he wrote that he intends to ""beat Trump like a drum"" in 2020.

Biden has had trouble collecting donations recently, Varney said, after he found himself in the middle of the investigation against President Trump over the content of a phone call during which Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine.

""He is a casualty of the impeachment, he is collateral damage,"" said Varney in an earlier interview.

Varney then turned to Bernie Sanders, who recently took a break from the campaign trail after he ended up in the hospital with heart complications and underwent an emergency procedure to repair a blocked artery, according to his campaign. It was later disclosed that he had suffered a heart attack.

Varney argued that Sanders' hospital visit lends credence to those questioning whether his age will get in the way of securing a spot in the Oval Office.

BERNIE SANDERS HAS STENTS INSERTED AFTER DOCTORS FIND BLOCKAGE

""We wish the Senator well,"" he said, ""but voters have to be a little skeptical that a 78-year-old can return for a year of exhausting campaigning.""

As Senator Elizabeth Warren surges in the polls, Democrats ""who don't buy her far left-leaning policies"" are becoming increasingly alarmed, Varney said.

WARREN FACES NEW QUESTIONS ON CREDIBILITY

""Warren proposes a wealth tax, a lobbying tax, a corporate profits tax, a higher social security tax on the rich, a higher income tax, and a higher tax on gunmakers... Simply put, the calmer voices in the Democratic party understand that Elizabeth Warren is unelectable,"" Varney said.

""The top three all have their troubles and the rest of the pack has failed to break through,"" concluded Varney.

""Wouldn't you think that, with the President under impeachment threat, the candidates trying to succeed him would be powering ahead? They're not,"" he added.

""It's Trump who has raised the most money, it's the Trump base that is united. I'll repeat,"" he continued, ""eight days before the next debate it's a Monday mess for the Democrat hopefuls.""

The former vice president’s $750 billion higher education plan represents a major expansion of the federal government’s role in educating Americans beyond high school. But Biden’s pitch Tuesday is not as sweeping as proposals from his 2020 rivals Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both of whom offer plans exceeding the $1 trillion mark.

JOE BIDEN UNVEILS NEW STRATEGY TO DEAL WITH GROWING UKRAINE CONTROVERSY

The competing approaches reflect Democrats’ efforts to address spiking tuition costs in the United States and the $1.5 trillion-plus in student debt held by about 45 million Americans. The party’s education policy divide is similar to the gap that separates Biden from the two progressive senators on health care, with the former vice president proposing to expand the federal government’s role in the existing health insurance market, while Warren and Sanders propose a single-payer insurance system that would see the federal government essentially replace private insurance altogether.

Jill Biden, the candidate’s wife and a longtime community college professor, explained her husband’s approach.

“My students inspire me,” she said in a conference call with reporters, “and they ask for one thing in return: opportunity.”

The crux of Biden’s higher education plan is a federal-state partnership to cover community college tuition and technical training. Biden calls for the federal government to cover 75 percent of the tuition costs, with states covering the rest. That’s a similar financing concept to the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and the disabled, with states required to cover some costs to qualify for federal money to cover the majority of the program.

Biden proposes that the federal government cover 95 percent of the community college tuition cost at Native Americans’ tribal campuses.

Sanders and Warren propose universal, free access to all undergraduate public colleges and universities.

On student debt, Biden’s more limited approach calls for doubling the Pell Grant program for low-income Americans and cutting in half the income percentage caps on student loan repayments. Borrowers now must pay up to 10 percent of their discretionary income. Biden calls for capping payments at 5 percent of discretionary income, while also delaying payments for anyone making less than $25,000, with the borrower accruing no additional interest.

Biden’s plan would forgive any remaining debt after 20 years of payments and would allow borrowers to get out of their debts as part of personal bankruptcy.

Sanders, conversely, proposes eliminating all student loan debt, while Warren calls for broad debt relief based on income. Warren’s idea would cancel $50,000 in debt for each person with household income under $100,000, with additional proportional relief for those making up to $250,000 annually.

Biden and Warren have another noticeable split on for-profit colleges, which have come under scrutiny because their graduates have a much higher default rate on loans as they struggle to find quality jobs. Biden proposes tighter regulations on those colleges to stop them “from profiteering off of students.” Warren calls for banning such businesses from getting federal money altogether.

All three Democratic hopefuls point to proposed tax increases to pay for their spending. Sanders would tax Wall Street transactions. Warren points to her “wealth tax,” 2 cents on every dollar of a household’s net worth beyond $50 million. Biden calls for eliminating certain breaks in inheritance taxes and capping itemized deductions for the wealthiest Americans."

The network said it would wait to announce the format, moderators, and specific location but did announce it would host the debate in cooperation with The Washington Post.

It also commented on which Democrats appeared to qualify for the debate. As of Tuesday, the field included former Vice President Joe Biden, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

For the fifth debate, Democratic candidates need to receive 165,000 unique donors -- including 600 spread out over 20 states -- and reach 3 percent in ""four qualifying state or national polls."" They can also make the stage with 5 percent in two qualifying state polls.

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY DEBATE

According to the announcement, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro have yet to meet the polling requirements.

NBC hosted the first Democratic primary debate in June with anchors Chuck Todd, Savannah Guthrie, Lester Holt, Jose Diaz-Balart, and Rachel Maddow. That debate sparked an early controversy between Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who also qualified for the fifth debate, after the former made controversial comments about racial issues.

Since June, the 2020 field has narrowed but at least 12 remained and qualified for the fourth debate set to take place in Ohio. That debate will be hosted by CNN and The New York Times on Oct. 15. Given the much smaller field, NBC can apparently avoid the two-night format of the first debate.

The DNC announced that the fourth-round debate would also be held on a single night. The 10 contenders who faced off in September automatically qualified for the October debate. And Gabbard and Steyer, who narrowly missed the September cut, reached the thresholds to qualify for the upcoming showdown by the deadline.

Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., announced Tuesday she is endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary -- choosing her former longtime Senate colleague over Kamala Harris, her fellow California Democratic senator.

Feinstein’s endorsement, the first major Democratic endorsement by a top legislator this campaign season, comes as Biden has been losing ground in the polls in the wake of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump and a series of high-profile gaffes while on the stump. But the longtime California senator praised the former vice president for his long tenure in Washington and his work on gun control.

“I’ve worked closely with Vice President Biden and I’ve seen firsthand his legislative ability, his statesmanship, and most importantly his moral fortitude,” Feinstein said in a statement. “During his time in Congress and in the White House, Joe Biden has been a tireless fighter for hard-working American families.”

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING DEMOCRATIC 2020 DEBATE

She added: “By making gun reform one of the pillars of his campaign and policy platform, Joe Biden demonstrates that he clearly recognizes what is needed to keep Americans safe. And I know, as president, he will continue the fight to restore the soul of the nation from the Oval Office.”

Feinstein’s endorsement of Biden may seem like a snub to Harris – a first-term senator and former California attorney general – but it hardly comes out of left field, as just last week she held a fundraiser for the former vice president in her home in San Francisco. Also back in January – following Biden’s campaign launch – Feinstein said that “he brings a level of experience and seniority which I think is really important,"" according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

The endorsement from Feinstein – a longtime liberal lawmaker who was first elected in 1992 – comes as Biden is struggling to hold on to his role as Democratic frontrunner. An average of recent polls compiled by Real Clear Politics has Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren virtually tied at the top of the Democratic race.

Warren, however, has surged in recent months in the polls, while Biden has dropped, and far surpassed him during the most recent quarter of fundraising.

Harris, meanwhile, sits in a distant fifth in the Real Clear Politics average, behind Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg."

WARREN UNDER FIRE FOR BIOGRAPHY, AGAIN

CBS News: “On the campaign trail, Elizabeth Warren often tells the story of how she was fired from her first teaching job in 1971 because she was pregnant, a pivotal moment that ultimately put her on a path to Harvard, the United States Senate, and quite possibly the presidency. But recently, several media outlets have questioned the veracity of these claims. In an exclusive interview with CBS News on Monday evening, Warren said she stands by her characterizations of why she left the job. ‘All I know is I was 22 years old, I was 6 months pregnant, and the job that I had been promised for the next year was going to someone else. The principal said they were going to hire someone else for my job,’ she said. … Asked by CBS News why she told the story differently at Berkeley a decade ago, Warren said her life since her election to the Senate in 2012 caused her to ‘open up’ about her past. … The Washington Free Beacon reported on a transcript from contemporaneous local school board meetings, also obtained by CBS News, which said Warren was rehired that spring and that the board ‘accepted with regret’ her ‘resignation’ the following summer.”



Ed Kilgore: The emerging anybody-but-Warren campaign - NY Mag: “But the problem with Warren that we are beginning to hear about most frequently is the claim that she’s just ‘too liberal’ or ‘too far left’ for otherwise persuadable voters (or donors) to countenance. Thus, in theory, she will lose swing voters that, say, Joe Biden might win, in part because her anti-corporate rhetoric and progressive policy positions will play into the Trump campaign’s clearly planned message that Democrats are all godless, baby-killing, America-hating socialists. Where is this argument coming from, if Warren is leading Trump in trial heats and becoming steadily more popular? Pretty clearly, corporate voices from Wall Street to Silicon Valley are taking the lead in demonizing her, for good reason: She’s a threat to their bottom lines and their all-but-sovereign business practices.”



Pennsylvanians unimpressed with 2020 Dems - FOX43: “Pennsylvania's presidential primary in 2020 is among the latest in the country. Only 10 states have primary dates later than April 28. … Of the 650 registered voters polled, 307 were registered Democrats. Of them, a majority of people (52%) say they are still undecided when it comes to who they plan to vote for in the Democratic presidential primary. Former Vice President Joe Biden still has the most interest among candidates with 17 percent of Democrats polled saying they would vote for him… Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren (9%) and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg (8%) both polled ahead of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders at 6 percent.”



Team Bernie want him to use heart attack to show personal side - WaPo: “Prominent friends and supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) say he should cut back on his relentless campaign pace and speak openly about his recent heart attack when he returns to the campaign trail, urging a shift toward a more personal and less hectic campaign than he has run so far. The comments reflect what supporters describe as a deeply personal decision with big implications for Sanders’s candidacy: how the 78-year-old democratic socialist, viewed by many of his backers as the leader of a movement, should proceed following a health scare that has sidelined him for days and raised questions about whether he can — or should — maintain the punishing demands of a presidential campaign. … Sanders supporters privately acknowledge concern that the heart attack could give voters second thoughts about the candidate, who would be the oldest president in history if elected.”



Klobuchar raises $4.8 million - Politico: “Democrat Amy Klobuchar raised $4.8 million between July and the end of September, her campaign announced Monday, a total that bested the Minnesota Senator’s haul from the previous quarter by $1 million. Klobuchar’s third-quarter fundraising was a fraction of the amount raised by top Democratic candidates such as Bernie Sanders, who raised the most of any candidate in the field, $25.3 million. But it is likely enough to keep Klobuchar’s campaign functioning as she attempts to secure more support. Klobuchar has qualified for the October Democratic debate and has crossed the donor threshold for the November debate, giving her opportunities to keep making the case for her presidential bid to a national audience.”



THE RULEBOOK: KEEP IT TOGETHER, PEOPLE

“If, on the other hand, they find us either destitute of an effectual government (each State doing right or wrong, as to its rulers may seem convenient), or split into three or four independent and probably discordant republics or confederacies … what a poor, pitiful figure will America make in their eyes!” – John Jay, Federalist No. 4



TIME OUT: CONSEQUENTIAL COW

History: “On October 8, 1871, flames spark in the Chicago barn of Patrick and Catherine O’Leary, igniting a two-day blaze that kills between 200 and 300 people, destroys 17,450 buildings, leaves 100,000 homeless and causes an estimated $200 million (in 1871 dollars; $3 billion in 2007 dollars) in damages. Legend has it that a cow kicked over a lantern in the O’Leary barn and started the fire, but other theories hold that humans or even a comet may have been responsible for the event that left four square miles of the Windy City, including its business district, in ruins. Dry weather and an abundance of wooden buildings, streets and sidewalks made Chicago vulnerable to fire. …Despite the fire’s devastation, much of Chicago’s physical infrastructure, including its water, sewage and transportation systems, remained intact. Reconstruction efforts began quickly and spurred great economic development and population growth, as architects laid the foundation for a modern city featuring the world’s first skyscrapers.”

SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT CLIMBING

WaPo: “A majority of Americans say they endorse the decision by House Democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry of President Trump, and nearly half of all adults also say the House should take the additional step and recommend that the president be removed from office, according to a Washington Post-Schar School poll. … The poll finds that, by a margin of 58 percent to 38 percent, Americans say the House was correct to undertake the inquiry. ... More than 8 in 10 Democrats endorse the inquiry and nearly 8 in 10 favor a vote to recommend that Trump be removed from office. Among Republicans, roughly 7 in 10 do not support the inquiry but almost 3 in 10 do, and almost one-fifth of Republicans say they favor a vote recommending his removal. Among the critical voting bloc of independents, support for the impeachment inquiry hits 57 percent, with 49 percent saying the House should vote to remove Trump from office.”



Trump digs in - NYT: “The Trump administration directed a top American diplomat involved in its pressure campaign on Ukraine not to appear Tuesday morning for a scheduled interview in the House’s impeachment inquiry. The decision to block Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, from speaking with investigators for three House committees is certain to provoke an immediate conflict with potentially profound consequences for the White House and President Trump. House Democrats have repeatedly warned that if the administration tries to interfere with their investigation, it will be construed as obstruction, a charge they see as potentially worthy of impeachment. Democrats from the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees did not immediately respond on Tuesday.”



Graham offers Giuliani a stage to fight back - Fox News: “Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has offered President Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, a chance to come before lawmakers to detail his allegations about former Vice President Joe Biden and his dealings with Ukraine. ‘Have heard on numerous occasions disturbing allegations by [Giuliani] about corruption in Ukraine and the many improprieties surrounding the firing of former Prosecutor-General Viktor Shokin,’ Graham said Tuesday on Twitter. ‘Therefore I will offer to Mr. Giuliani the opportunity to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to inform the committee of his concerns.’ Giuliani told Fox News on Tuesday he intends to testify, but needs to go over the offer with the other attorneys involved to determine whether they could sort out issues regarding attorney-client privilege and executive privilege.”



House Dems try to keep whistleblower secret - WaPo: “House Democrats are weighing extraordinary steps to secure testimony from a whistleblower whose complaint prompted their impeachment inquiry, masking his identity to prevent President Trump’s congressional allies from exposing the individual, according to three officials familiar with the deliberations. The steps under consideration include having the whistleblower testify from a remote location and obscuring the individual’s appearance and voice, these officials said. The efforts reflect Democrats’ deepening distrust of their GOP colleagues, whom they see as fully invested in defending a president who has attacked the whistleblower’s credibility and demanded absolute loyalty from Republicans. ‘There are lots of different protocols and procedures we’re looking into to find out what works and doesn’t work to protect the identity of the whistleblower,’ said a person familiar with the talks.”



Perry under pressure - Politico: “Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Monday denied that he pressed the Ukrainian government to put two U.S. businessmen on the board of the state energy company or that he was planning to leave the Trump administration. … Perry acknowledged making the recommendations to Ukraine’s state-owned natural gas company Naftogaz, but said he did so only at the request of that country’s government. He also said it was ‘true’ that he had pressed President Donald Trump to make the July call to Zelensky that is at the center of the impeachment inquiry. … Perry also denied he was planning to step down from his position, which POLITICO, the New York Times and Washington Post reported last week. ‘I’m here. I’m serving. They’ve been writing the story that I was leaving the Department of Energy for at least nine months now.’”

AUDIBLE: COWBOY DIPLOMACY

“We're all different and I think that we've forgotten that that's okay that we're all different… but just because I don't agree with someone on everything doesn't mean that I'm not going to be friends with them.” – Ellen DeGeneres’ response after receiving backlash for appearing at a Dallas Cowboys football game next to former President George W. Bush, whom she calls a friend.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Chris, you sounded like a Democrat politician when you dodged a direct answer to Meredith Shoemaker’s question [on Monday]. She did not ask you what you thought of President Trump’s call with the Ukrainian President. She asked you very directly ‘what law did President Trump break?’ With the impeachment standard being ‘high crimes and misdemeanors,’ Meredith’s question gets to the heart of the matter. Can I give you second chance here? No Democrat talking points, please. What law?” – Kevin Cook, Farmers Branch, Texas



[Ed. note: So I gather you’re not a Democrat, Mr. Cook! The question of a specific criminal statue here isn’t relevant. Congress’ power to impeach and remove is pretty much unlimited. Andrew Johnson’s impeachment, for example, rested on 11 articles, some relating to specific crimes, but check out the 10th and 11th articles here. How about alleging that Johnson acted “to bring into disgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt and reproach” on Congress? It’s not a crime to ridicule Congress, even for the president. But Congress was asserting that Johnson’s efforts to undermine Congress was a breach of his duties under the constitutional. Or think of a hypothetical. What if a president laid up dead drunk every day at the White House or was posting top secret documents on Instagram? Neither of those things would be illegal for the president to do, but both would surely doubt in his or her impeachment. These are political, not legal considerations. Democrats in this case are focusing on the president seeking help from a foreign power against a political opponent, and the Constitution gives them more than enough room to do so.]



“At the risk of being accused of being ‘too cute by a half,’ until Joe Biden receives the Democratic nomination, can he really be considered a ‘political opponent’ for the purpose of prohibiting the President from asking for investigative assistance from a foreign government? Full disclosure – I am a supporter of President Trump.” – Tim Kasparek, Goodyear, Ariz.

SF Gate: “Reptile breeder Brian Gundy had just given a talk and animal presentation Saturday at the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Library in downtown San Jose. While going to get his car parked on the second level of the Fourth and San Fernando Street garage about 4:30 p.m., he left his snakes and lizards in boxes and a bag in a no-parking zone. When he returned for his critters, he made a grim discovery. ‘As I was loading up my gear, I realized the bag that had my four pythons and blue skink lizard inside was gone and they were just there seconds ago,’ Gundy told KTVU Fox 2. Gundy had seen several people walk by his equipment, so he ran after them but couldn't catch up. He told KTVU he doesn't think they knew what was inside. … The stolen animals were worth approximately $5,000, according to the reptile breeder.”

Washington insiders report that Democratic Party officials are also urging the former first lady to enter the race. They see Joe Biden’s campaign in free-fall, with polling and donations dropping, and they are panicked that Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren grows more inevitable by the day. Warren, they think, is way too liberal to win a national election. (They are correct.)

Hence, the overtures to Mrs. Obama, the most admired woman in the country, according to Gallup polls. And not only in the U.S.; according to a YouGov survey, Michelle is the most admired woman in the world. Admittedly, for that honor, she displaced actress Angelina Jolie, whom most would not consider presidential material, but even so…

MICHELLE OBAMA SAYS THERE'S 'ZERO CHANCE' SHE'LL RUN FOR PRESIDENT: 'IT'S JUST NOT FOR ME'

It must be tempting for DNC apparatchiks to look for a new Super Candidate. Notwithstanding the unprecedented number of 2020 contenders, the herd has thinned; the leaders today are no lock to beat President Trump.

Former Vice President Joe Biden is struggling. His money-raise in the third quarter was a pitiful $15 million, nearly $10 million behind Elizabeth Warren. In the RealClearPolitics average of polls, Biden’s line trends downward like a stock you don’t want to own. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/sc/south_carolina_democratic_presidential_primary-6824.html

Joe’s problems mounted (as I predicted) when Democrats jumped into full-impeachment mode. Their focus on Trump’s push to investigate Biden for corruption in Ukraine of course also brought scrutiny to his son Hunter’s lucrative job with Burisma, a local gas company.

That the younger Biden was paid $50,000 per month by a company whose founder had been under investigation for tax evasion and money laundering and that he won that post when his father was the Obama administration’s point person in Ukraine raises reasonable questions. There may have been no wrongdoing, but the episode is an unpleasant reminder that Biden has been a swamp dweller for decades, and swamp mud tends to cling.

Biden’s worst problem, however, is that he has not batted down Trump’s accusations more convincingly. In a recent front-page piece, the New York Times quotes Democrats who bemoan Biden’s response as tepid and worrisome; they see it as evidence he may not be up to the task of confronting Trump on the campaign trail.

David Plouffe, Obama’s former campaign manager, is reportedly “mystified” by Biden’s hesitance, saying the former vice president should “use this moment and become Trump’s opponent.” But, he has not.

Meanwhile, Warren barrels ahead, much to the dismay of moderate Democrats who admire her zeal but worry that with her far-left agenda she cannot win a national election. Warren’s appeal is strong among women, college-educated whites and young people, but she has yet to bring minority voters on board, and she also trails with whites without a college degree. She recently rolled out a lengthy pro-union program aimed at attracting blue-collar workers, but her embrace of “Medicare-for-all” and the Green New Deal has to date not won over that important Democrat cohort.

Hence, the search for a miracle outsider. But would Michelle Obama want to run? And, would she win?

The Obamas are enjoying life in the post-presidential fast lane, frolicking with billionaires and celebrities like Bruce Springsteen, Oprah, David Geffen and Richard Branson, celebrating their new-found freedom on yachts in Tahiti and elsewhere.

They are also celebrating their new-found wealth. Each has reportedly signed book deals worth $60 million, and signed a “high ten-figure” contract to help Netflix produce films. They recently plunked down $15 million for a beachfront home in Martha’s Vineyard; their net worth has been estimated https://www.businessinsider.com/barack-obama-michelle-obama-net-worth-2018-7 to be between at $40 million and $135 million.

Would Michelle give that up? She says no; she has twice declared publicly she would not run. She must know that campaigning against Trump would be ugly, no matter her credentials or popularity.

Past controversies will dog her, like this remark in 2008: “For the first time in my adult life, I am really proud of my country…” Critics will again scrutinize her Princeton thesis; her kids will once more be thrust on the national stage. Running for president is a dirty business.

But there’s a bigger problem awaiting any last-minute entrant into the 2020 race. Bernie Sanders’ supporters are already angry, convinced they were cheated out of victory by the DNC in 2016.

Hillary Clinton blames Bernie (along with scads of other villains) for her 2016 loss, saying he did not campaign hard enough on her behalf. As a result, she claims, some offended Sanders supporters simply stayed home.

The same will be true in 2020 should the party try an end-run – only this time it will be both Sanders’ army and Warren’s fans who will be furious. Combined, those progressives are attracting 41 percent of Democratic primary voters. That large group will be loath to give up their crusade. Sure, Michelle is popular, but will she adopt their favored policies like the Green New Deal or open borders?

Also, it has been clear in recent months that President Obama’s star has faded. Numerous Democrat candidates have been quick to blast his TPP trade deal and even his signature Affordable Care Act, clearly convinced the Obama imprimatur no longer carries much weight with voters. As much as Biden clings to his relationship with the former president, the less it seems to matter.

Maybe that’s because Democrats now concede that the former president demolished their party; under his leadership, Democrats lost 18 governorships and 816 state legislative seats, 12 seats in the U.S. Senate seats and 64 in the House. Obama left the party politically and financially bankrupt.

Because of those Obama-era losses, President Trump has been able to enact tax and regulation reforms, and appoint hundreds of judges and two Associate Justices of the Supreme Court. Do Democrats really want to travel down that road again?

158,Steve Moore,"The latest Census Bureau Current Population Survey data now show that middle-class incomes, after adjusting for inflation, have surged by $5,003 since Donald Trump became president in January 2017. Median household income has now reached $65,976 – an all-time… [+3228 chars]",Middle-class families are enjoying a near-unprecedented income windfall.,2019-10-07,Fox News,Steve Moore: Democrats are wrong. Middle-class incomes surging – thanks to Trump policies,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/steve-moore-democrats-are-wrong-middle-class-incomes-surging-thanks-to-trump-policies,"The latest Census Bureau Current Population Survey data now show that middle-class incomes, after adjusting for inflation, have surged by $5,003 since Donald Trump became president in January 2017. Median household income has now reached $65,976 – an all-time high and up more than 8 percent in 2019 dollars under the Trump presidency.

This data was compiled by the statisticians at Sentier Research, an economic research group whose founders have more than 30 years of experience at the Census Bureau in analyzing the monthly income numbers.

I reported last week in the Wall Street Journal that real median family income had soared by $4,146 under Trump through July 2019. The just-released August numbers from Sentier show a huge monthly gain of $857 in income per household.

MIKE HUCKABEE: TRUMP ECONOMY IS DELIVERING HIGHER INCOMES AND RECORD EMPLOYMENT FOR AMERICANS

These numbers contrast sharply with the 16 years prior to Trump’s presidency. In the eight years that George W. Bush was president, median income barely showed any gain, up just $401 thanks to the deep recession of 2008.

In the seven and a half years that Barack Obama was president, and not including the end of the recession, which Obama inherited, incomes inched up by $1,043 (June 2009 – January 2019). This means that in the 16 years before the Trump presidency, incomes rose by about $1,500 while in less than three years middle incomes have risen three times faster.

The contrast is even sharper when measured on a monthy basis. The monthly rise in incomes under Bush was $4. That number was $11 under Obama and $161 under Trump.

These income numbers are PRE-TAX, so they do NOT include the impact of the Trump tax cut. The Heritage Foundation estimates that the average household has saved $1,400 a year on their federal taxes from the 2017 Trump tax cut. This means many working-class families now have a $6,000 higher after-tax, and after-inflation paycheck today.

These surges in income, especially in the last several months, have occurred at exactly the time when many liberal economists and media talking heads were shouting “recession.” In reality middle-class families were enjoying a near-unprecedented income windfall and “the gains in income levels in recent months,” Sentier reports, “have been accelerating.“

These surges in income, especially in the last several months, have occurred at exactly the time when many liberal economists and media talking heads were shouting “recession.”

These higher wage and salary incomes are no doubt related to the very tight labor market, which has given workers new bargaining power to ask for higher pay. Today there are more than seven million unfilled jobs in America – the highest number of surplus jobs in American history.

CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM

These latest income numbers also squarely contradict the claims by Democratic presidential candidates, such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who claim that all the gains from the Trump economy have gone to the rich and large corporations. Warren claimed earlier this year that workers had to work ""two or three or four jobs"" just to keep their incomes from falling.

No, this has been one of the biggest middle-class success stories in modern times, and it is a testament to the success of the Trump tax, regulatory and energy policies.

Elizabeth Warren is holding a slight edge over former Vice President Joe Biden in the race for their party’s 2020 nomination.

The poll – released Tuesday by Quinnipiac University – is the latest in a slew of national and early voting state surveys in recent weeks to show Warren has surged and now is virtually tied with Biden in the Democratic primary battle.

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING DEMOCRATIC 2020 DEBATE

The populist senator from Massachusetts who has produced one progressive plan after another stands at 29 percent support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents in the survey. Biden – who for months was the unrivaled front-runner – registers at 26 percent. Warren’s three-point advantage over the former vice president is within the poll’s margin of error.

“Warren maintains her strength in the Democratic primary, which has been consistently growing since the start of her campaign. This poll confirms her status as a co-frontrunner with Biden,"" Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said.

Sen. Bernie Sanders – the progressive independent from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House run – received 16 percent support.

Warren was at 27 percent, Biden 25 percent, and Sanders 16 percent in Quinnipiac's last Democratic primary poll, which was released two weeks ago.

QUESTIONS MOUNT OVER WARREN'S STUMP SPEECH STORY THAT SHE LOST HER TEACHING JOB BECAUSE SHE WAS PREGNANT

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is a distant fourth, at 4 percent, in the new survey. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang stand at 3 percent in the survey. Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota register at 2 percent, with everyone one else in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential candidates coming in at 1 percent or less.

Biden tops President Trump 51-40 percent in a hypothetical general election matchup. But that’s down from a 16 percentage point lead over the GOP president in Quinnipiac’s late August poll. Warren’s ahead of Trump by eight points in the new survey, down from a 12-point lead in August. And Sanders beat the president by 7 points, down from a 14 point lead in the previous poll.

The new poll also indicates that registered voters nationwide remain divided over impeaching and removing the president from office over the Ukrainian crisis.

IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY GETS MAJORITY SUPPORT IN NEW POLL

Forty-five percent of registered voters say Trump should be impeached and removed from office, with 49 percent opposing such a move. Voters were evenly split at 47 percent in last week’s Quinnipiac survey. But a Quinnipiac poll released late last month – before news of the Ukrainian crisis broke – indicated support for impeachment at just 37 percent.

The new poll indicates 53-43 percent majority support for impeachment inquiry being conducted the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, a slight uptick from 52-45 percent backing for the investigation a week ago.

As expected, there’s a vast partisan divide, with 92 percent of Democrats saying the inquiry’s legitimate and 88 percent of Republicans calling it a witch hunt. By a 52-40 percent margin, independents say the investigation into Trump is legitimate.

Trump’s under fire over his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter over their dealings in the eastern European country that’s been battling Russia this decade. Fueled by whistleblower complaints and a read-out of the call released by the White House, Democrats argue the president was asking a foreign country to potentially interfere in a U.S. election.

Trump has repeatedly insisted that he did nothing wrong and has on numerous occasions described his conversation with the Ukrainian leader as “perfect.”

The president and allies have instead tried to put the spotlight in the scandal on Biden, a political rival who’s hoping to face off against the president in next year’s election.

Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – who had been widely accused by both Democrats and Republicans of overlooking corruption in his own office – was later dismissed.

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted October 4-7, with 1,483 self-identified registered voters questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, with a sampling error of plus or minus 4.7 percent for questions to the 646 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents."

BIDEN STILL SLIDIN’

IBD: “Elizabeth Warren has taken a narrow lead over Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, the October IBD/TIPP Poll found. Both candidates continue to lead in a head-to-head matchup against President Trump, though Biden had a more comfortable lead, outside the margin of error. Elizabeth Warren had the support of 27%, with Joe Biden backed by 26% and Bernie Sanders a distant third at 10%. Support for South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg climbed to 7% from 5%. No other candidate polled more than 3%. The October IBD/TIPP Poll showed continued momentum for Warren. Last month's poll had shown support for Warren jumping to 24% from 17%. Meanwhile, Biden's support saw further erosion, after slipping to 28% in September from 30% in August. Sanders, whose nomination prospects could suffer after his heart attack last week, saw support fall after registering 12% the prior two months.”



Biden expands lead in South Carolina - Fox News: “Joe Biden increases his lead in the Palmetto State, as a growing number of South Carolina Democratic primary voters want a candidate who can defeat President Trump. The former vice president is ahead by 29 points, according to a Fox News Poll. That’s up from a 21-point lead in July. Biden captures 41 percent support among Democratic primary voters (+6 points since July), Elizabeth Warren trails with 12 percent (+7), and Bernie Sanders gets 10 percent (-4). … Kamala Harris receives 4 percent, down from 12 percent. Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July, also gets 4 percent. Cory Booker (3 percent) and Pete Buttigieg (2 percent) held steady. All others receive 1 percent or less. South Carolina holds its Democratic primary February 29, 2020. … Biden [has] large leads among blacks (+41 points), men (+31), and voters over age 45 (+38).”



Trump trails Dems in Wisconsin - Fox News: “Wisconsin voters are unhappy with how things are going in the country, oppose the border wall, think tariffs hurt the economy, and disapprove of the job President Trump is doing. … Joe Biden bests Trump by 9 points (48-39 percent) and has the only lead outside the poll’s margin of error. Bernie Sanders is up by 5 over Trump (45-40) and Elizabeth Warren has a 4-point edge (45-41). In each case, the remaining 13-14 percent of undecided/third-party voters is enough to shift the race either way. Trump receives 41 percent support or less in each of the matchups -- well below the 47 percent he won the Badger State with in 2016. At the same time, none of the Democrats hit 50 percent.”



Have you tried turning your campaign off, then turning it back on? - NYT: “At campaign events this past week, Ms. [Kamala] Harris debuted a fresh stump speech focused on the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump, an issue in which her campaign believes she is uniquely suited to lead as a former prosecutor. She began each of the rallies, titled ‘Dude Gotta Go,’ with a lengthy discussion of the president’s purported crimes, and concluded by talking directly about the idea of ‘electability,’ which she described as the ‘elephant’ in the 2020 race, and the fear that the country was not ready to elect a black woman as president. … In strategic terms, her campaign’s choice to pivot to Iowa is a concession that its initial theory of the presidential race was at least partially incorrect. From the start, her longtime advisers mapped out a national strategy that highlighted primaries with more diverse electorates … while conserving resources often used in early states for television advertisements in later ones.”



STEYER STICKING AROUND

Fox Business: “The wealthiest Democrat in the 2020 race, billionaire Tom Steyer, announced Sunday that he qualified for the November debate. Steyer is worth a whopping $1.6 billion. Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney is the runner-up with a net worth of roughly $200 million. ‘Tom is surging because he’s not part of the establishment and his message of ending the corporate takeover of our government is resonating,’ his campaign manager Heather Hargreaves said in a statement. ‘Tom is excited to continue getting out there and meeting with voters all across the country, hearing their stories, and connecting with them personally, and we are thrilled to see him on stage sharing his vision with the full country at the DNC debate in Ohio on October 15th and in November.’”



Sanders takes aim at DNC corporate donors in new plan - Politico: “Bernie Sanders, a longtime critic of the nation’s campaign finance system, is releasing a plan Monday aimed at ending the influence of corporate cash in politics, including at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. The Vermont senator pledges to put a stop to all corporate PAC contributions to the convention if he wins the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination. AT&T, Facebook, Independence Blue Cross and other companies each gave seven-figure donations to the event’s host committee in 2016. … His proposal also calls for a lifetime lobbying ban on Democratic National Committee chairs and co-chairs, as well as a prohibition on them working for companies that hold federal contracts or are trying to obtain government approval for mergers or other projects.”



Dem race becomes one of uncertainty - WaPo: “Interviews with more than two dozen Democratic leaders, top strategists and former elected officials revealed that most are still holding out judgment about how — or how much — the events will shift the race. But they point to several worrying factors [about Biden, Warren and Sanders]… Others expressed skepticism that any Democrat would be able to compete against Trump’s unmatched ability to shift the public’s focus. … The shifting dynamic has already altered campaign strategies, as some trailing candidates focus on early-voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire… But for the front-running trio, the events of the last two weeks have served as a public test of how they would handle crises in a general election.”



THE RULEBOOK: KEEP IN MIND…

“…it will be equally forgotten that the vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty; that, in the contemplation of a sound and well-informed judgment, their interest can never be separated…” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 1



TIME OUT: THE COMEBACK OF ‘THE NATION’S RIVER’

Smithsonian: “When George Washington chose to build his Mount Vernon estate along the Potomac River, he declared the then-pristine body of water ‘the nation’s river.’ At the time, even dolphins were a common sight. In fact, as Karin Bruillard at the Washington Post reports, the porpoises were seen as far upriver as Alexandria, Virginia, in the 1840s. But by the 1960s, the river that flows through the nation’s capital had lost its luster. … Now, after almost 50 years of pollution control, clean-up and restoration efforts, researchers have catalogued well over 1,000 bottlenose dolphins living, mating, and even giving birth in the lower reaches of the river. … Over the past four years, researchers from Georgetown University’s Potomac-Chesapeake Dolphin Project have been cataloguing dolphins in the lake-like area where the Potomac joins the Chesapeake Bay, reports Bruillard for the Post. … But the most exciting development came in August, when researchers witnessed a dolphin giving birth in the river.”

PELOSI RIDES TO RESCUE

WaPo: “A Democratic group with close ties to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is set to spend more than $1 million on ads set to begin airing this week aimed at bolstering a handful of vulnerable House Democrats as the impeachment probe unfolds. The ads from House Majority Forward, examples of which were reviewed by The Washington Post, do not mention the word ‘impeachment.’ Instead, they focus solely on the accomplishments of the 11 individual lawmakers targeted in the campaign. … The campaign represents the first tranche of television ads to be aired by a group with close ties to the party establishment. House Majority Forward is an affiliate of House Majority PAC, the largest Democratic super PAC focused solely on House races. The focus on non-impeachment issues is further evidence that Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Democratic leaders are aiming to sell a ‘walk and chew gum’ image for the party — that they can investigate and possibly impeach President Trump while also working to make progress on jobs, health care and other concerns.”



Team Trump sends Pence impeachment Dems districts - Politico: “The White House wants to make vulnerable House Democrats pay for impeachment. Starting this week, Vice President Mike Pence will embark on a national tour of congressional districts represented by Democrats who’ve come out in support of the inquiry. … Each of the districts on Pence's itinerary were won by Trump in 2016, making them potent targets for Republicans. The vice president will travel Wednesday to the southwest Iowa district of Rep. Cindy Axne, and Thursday he’s slated to visit the suburban Twin Cities district of another freshman Democrat, Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig. The vice president is then scheduled to barnstorm an array of battleground districts, including those held by Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger.”



McConnell uses campaign ad to flex impeachment muscle - Louisville Courier Journal: “Earlier [last] week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said his chamber would have ‘no choice’ but to hold a trial on whether to remove President Donald Trump from office if the House votes to impeach. But in a new campaign ad on Facebook, the Kentucky Republican makes clear that any impeachment attempt will fail as long as he remains in charge of the Senate. ‘Nancy Pelosi's in the clutches of a left wing mob. They finally convinced her to impeach the president,’ McConnell says directly to the camera in a 17-second video. ‘All of you know your Constitution. The way that impeachment stops is a Senate majority with me as majority leader.’ … The McConnell campaign, according to Facebook's ‘Ad Library,’ started running the digital ad last week…”



SUPCO BACK IN SESSION

Fox News: “Now, as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to launch its new term Monday, a 5-4 conservative majority could be poised to provide the White House with significant legal and political victories -- or setbacks. Such are the unusual dynamics now percolating from the nation's highest court. The justices' election-year agenda includes cases dealing with Trump's executive power over immigration, along with LGBTQ workplace discrimination, gun rights and abortion regulations. All are teed up to be argued this term, with religious liberty and health-care appeals good bets to be added to the docket. All will likely be decided in a presidential election year. ‘The court will be an issue in 2020 but that's perfectly normal. It was a huge issue in 2016, it helped get President Trump elected,’ said Paul Smith, a Georgetown University law professor who has argued 21 cases before the high court. ‘And it will be so again, precisely because it's become such an important part of our system.’”

AUDIBLE: HABITUAL LINE STEPPER

“We say, ‘Don’t cross this line.’ Okay, you crossed it. So, ‘Don’t cross this line.’ We’re finally at a point where patience is exhausted, reason is exhausted and, quite frankly, the voters are exhausted.” – Tom Rath, a longtime member of the GOP in New Hampshire, explaining the crossroads Republicans are at with the president right now, per the WaPo.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“A week ago (give or take a few days), you ran a lead article to the effect that over the months ahead you were going to soberly and impartially report the facts at every turn in the very ‘wine-dy’ (meaning curve-y) road to the 2020 election. Your lead article [Friday] entitled ‘Trump Offers No Off Ramps to Republicans’ strikes me (after the second reading) as anything but consistent with what I understood to be your sober and impartial mission. It seems that your article is strongly slanted against Trump from beginning to end. If I am wrong, can you explain what your ‘Off Ramp’ article would have to say in order to fail your criteria of impartiality, none-emotional, none-judgmental reporting and analysis? I'm genuinely baffled.” – Eric Hutchins, Santa Barbara, Calif.



[Ed. note: I gather from your sentiments, Mr. Hutchins that you are a political supporter of the president. And I understand that for the president’s supporters these are trying, frustrating, exhausting days. If one agrees with the president that his conduct relating to Joe Biden and Ukraine has been “perfect” then what’s happening now must seem like madness. But to most observers, the president failed in his duty by entwining domestic politics with foreign policy. It’s proving to be quite damaging. Now, I don’t care who believes what. You may think Trump hung the moon or you may think Trump is Old Scratch himself. Not my problem. What I promised you on Sept. 26 was that we would not obsess over minutiae from the day to day battle between the two sides over impeachment: “You have plenty of other options for getting the latest details on what this unnamed source said or what that hearing may or may not have revealed. We’re going to stay focused on the political repercussions because that’s our job.” I’m not sure how I’m supposed to do that and not talk about what’s happening in the news. The president is getting absolutely smashed over his conduct vis-a-vis Biden. Support for impeachment has jumped hugely. Republicans are in a defensive crouch and every day one of the president’s team seems to make another blunder that makes the situation even worse. It’s a political catastrophe. It may end up actually working out for Trump and the GOP. Democrats are making plenty of errors of their own and this may all blow up in their faces. And if it does, we’ll certainly be talking about it. But right now, the president and his core supporters don’t seem to understand what a pickle he’s put them in — and the huge problems he’s creating for the GOP. Trump had just gotten out of the woods on the Mueller probe and the very next day needlessly put himself in this jackpot. The position that the president has taken — the “perfect” doctrine — does not reflect the political reality for many members of his party. They need to be able to say that they disapprove, like Democrats did a generation ago, but think America should now “move on” from a divisive distraction. It’s none of my business who wins this fight. That’s up to you. But if you’re interested in my abilities as a forecaster and analyst, it will mean hearing things that you don’t always agree with and certainly discussing matters that are bad news for your team. But it will also mean that I will tell it to you straight. That I will be fair-minded. That I will listen and admit when I’m wrong. That I will give you my thoughts without fear or favor. That we will always do our best.]



“Chris, I’ll keep this short and sweet: 1. Where can I find the law that prohibits a candidate from getting ‘dirt’ on his political opponent from a foreign government? 2. Why is it against the law? Don’t I as a constituent have the right to know if a candidate has broken the law regardless of where the act was committed? 3. If you can never investigate a political opponent for deeds done in a foreign country, what’s to keep someone from simply committing all of their illegal acts in a foreign country?” – Meredith Shoemaker, Sugar Land, Texas



[Ed. note: The president mustn’t do such things himself. And he especially mustn’t do them when he would be the direct beneficiary. We have a Justice Department and a Department of State. We have federal police at the FBI. We have all manner of means by which to combat corruption here and abroad. But when it’s about his political opponents, the president must do his best to stay out of it. Doing otherwise diminishes the confidence Americans have in our legal system to provide dispassionate justice. Presidents of both parties have failed this test in the past so we know how real the temptation is. But it’s not something Americans want to become normal. That’s how governments operate in places like Turkey, Russia and China: People in power use that power to stifle their rivals. I know Trump believes the system is rigged against him, but he is still the president and he must find some way to better honor that high vocation or voters will surely throw him out next year.]



“Unforced errors are the worst kind of errors, in sports and everywhere else. I am reminded of Watergate back when President Richard Nixon was running for re-election. No benefit or advantage was gained from the break-in, and Nixon won re-election in a landslide anyway. Here now President Trump is trying to compromise Joe Biden as a candidate with actions that are expected to have substantial negative consequences for the incumbent – and for what? The race for the Democratic nominee is far from over, but Biden seems to be suffering from the ‘Curse of the Early Frontrunner’ and slipping in the polls for many other reasons than those that are being brought to light from any revelations out of The Ukraine. Hindsight, but also no small amount of foresight and experience, suggests that it would have been (and is) best to ‘keep your powder dry’ for whomever is the actual nominee and not waste time and resources going after those who will not be running against you. If Joe Biden is not the eventual Democratic nominee, this may well be one of those unforced errors that may even approach the impact and magnitude of the Watergate disaster. So much for learning from our past mistakes.” – Kent Haldorson, Beaverton, Ore.



[Ed. note: That’s a very interesting take, Mr. Haldorson. I’m going to chew on it for a while. If I write on it, it will be with due credit to you, sir.]

SO FRESH YOU CAN TASTE THE SQUEAK

Fox News: “And we thought mustard ice cream was a stretch. An ice cream vendor in Ecuador is reportedly seeing demand for her new — and arguably strangest — offering. It's made using the flesh of guinea pigs. Guinea pig meat, known as ‘cuy’ in Ecuador, is typically eaten as a savory dish there and in other South American countries, like Peru and Colombia, where it's often grilled and served whole, per NPR. But María del Carmen Pilapaña, who runs a small stall near the capital of Quito, has stumbled upon a completely new preparation — and it is a hit, she tells The Associated Press. … Pilapaña makes the ice cream by cooking down the guinea pig’s meat and making a pate of sorts before blending it with milk or cream, freezing it, and serving it just like she does with her other flavors.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“As I became convinced of the practical and theoretical defects of the social-democratic tendencies of my youth, it was but a short distance to a philosophy of restrained, free-market governance that gave more space and place to the individual and to the civil society that stands between citizen and state.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the National Review on Oct. 25, 2013.

Campos-Duffy's advice for parents was sparked by her recent visit to Marquette University in Wisconsin where she was invited by Young America’s Foundation club (YAF) to speak about the importance of defending American capitalism.

LAURA INGRAHAM: RECANTED HATE CRIME PART OF 'P.C. CULTURE AND A VICTIMOLOGY CULTURE GONE TOTALLY AWRY'

She was confronted by campus protesters and she wrote about it in an op-ed published on Fox Business.

In the piece, Campos-Duffy recalled that she was prepared for her critics, but she was taken by surprise by a Chinese foreign exchange student, who stood up and ""taught all of us that night a lesson in the dangers of romanticizing socialism and communism.""

""After asking a thoughtful question, I asked him if he would explain to the students in the room how the Chinese social credit system worked,"" she wrote.

""He described how the Communist Chinese government tracks its citizens’ phones, internet use, attendance to Communist party events and other activities and uses this 'score' to determine your family’s financial fate, the quality of education your child receives, and whether you will be arrested or punished for thinking the wrong thoughts. I was alarmed by how many of the students in the room were unaware of this fact of life in Communist China.""

On ""Fox and Friends,"" Campos-Duffy said that she came away from that experience with the conviction that parents must step up to teach their children, when educators, politicians and public figures do not.

""What I found on college campuses is -- with the exception of a few ... conservative students -- so many kids are falling for the lies and the promises of 'free'... that are being sold today by [New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], by [Vermont Sen.] Bernie Sanders and by [Massachusetts Sen.] Elizabeth Warren,"" said Campos-Duffy.

""The question is what do you do about it? And my experience is that you have to start young -- you can't wait until your kids come home with the stories from their socialist professors at the university. If you're not having a conversation with your young kids at home then somebody else is,"" she concluded.

KAT TIMPF GIVES DATING ADVICE TO VEGAN FED UP WITH BAD JOKES

Campos-Duffy also previewed an important new episode of her Fox Nation show, ""Moms,"" where she interviews women of all different backgrounds about the challenges of motherhood.

""We actually travel to Texas to meet with real-life moms there, who are dealing with fertility issues, so it's a really heavy topic, but so much hope, so much love and compassion that was shared inside of that story... More people than we think are struggling with this, so its a topic that we really wanted to touch on,"" Campos-Duffy told ""Fox and Friends"" co-host Ainsley Earhardt.

In that episode, which will be available on Fox Nation on October 10, one mother shared her heartbreaking story of turning to in vitro fertilization after the death of her first child.

""We learned about mid-way through our pregnancy that she had some physical abnormalities that led them to believe that there may be genetic abnormalities as wel l... unfortunately when she was born she had a rare lung disease that she passed from, "" she said. ""In order to avoid that happening again and not have to make a choice with each pregnancy, we decided to do IVF -- which led us to our second daughter Avery, and she's 10 months old now.""

162,Gregg Re,Senate Republicans on Tuesday sought an update from the Justice Department and the FBI concerning four accusers who allegedly made false claims under oath against now-Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings last year.… [+4277 chars],Senate Republicans on Tuesday sought an update from the Justice Department and the FBI concerning four accusers who allegedly made false claims under oath against now-Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings last year.,2019-10-08,Fox News,Kavanaugh controversy: Senate Republicans want update on criminal referrals over dubious accusations,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/brett-kavanaugh-senate-republicans-criminal-referrals-accusations-update,"Senate Republicans on Tuesday sought an update from the Justice Department and the FBI concerning four accusers who allegedly made false claims under oath against now-Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings last year.

The letter to Attorney General Bill Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray -- signed by GOP Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, Ted Cruz and John Cornyn of Texas, Mike Crapo of Idaho, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Kennedy of Louisiana and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee -- came as Democrats have sought to relitigate the Kavanaugh issue, with virtually all of the party's 2020 presidential contenders calling for the justice to be impeached.

The first criminal referral, the senators wrote, concerned the ""false allegation made by an individual who told the [Judiciary] Committee that he had direct knowledge that Judge Kavanaugh assaulted a close friend on a boat in the harbor at Newport, Rhode Island in 1985.""

The Twitter account belonging to that accuser apparently advocated for a military coup against the Trump administration. The accuser, who had contacted the office of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., recanted the sexual assault claim on the social media site days later, after an investigation by Senate Republicans.

NEW YORK TIMES UPDATES KAVANAUGH 'BOMBSHELL' WITH ONE MINOR DETAIL -- 'ACCUSER' HAS NO RECOLLECTION OF ALLEGED EPISODE

The second referral involved a claim from disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti and client Julie Swetnick, alleging that Kavanaugh participated in gang-rape trains.

""After a thorough investigation, the committee found no verifiable evidence to support any of the allegations made in the declaration,"" the senators wrote. ""The committee also found that both Mr. Avenatti and Ms. Swetnick had a long history of credibility issues and may have criminally conspired to mislead the committee and obstruct its investigation.""

EX-BOYFRIEND TELLS FOX NEWS THAT SWETNICK THREATENED TO KILL UNBORN CHILD, ALWAYS EXAGGERATED STORIES

The third referral specifically implicated Avenatti, who submitted a ""sworn statement by an unknown declarant claimed that Judge Kavanaugh had spiked the punch at house parties with Quaaludes and/or grain alcohol."" NBC News later reported that the apparent declarant had said Avenatti ""twisted her words.""

The final referral concerned a claim by Judy Munro-Leighton, who had sent an email to the Judiciary Committee indicating that she was ""the author of an unsigned letter containing highly graphic sexual-assault accusations against Judge Kavanaugh previously received by the office of Senator Kamala Harris."" But, when committee staff later interviewed her, ""she admitted that she falsely identified herself as the author of the letter and its allegations and had only claimed authorship 'as a way to grab attention.'""

The letter added: ""When asked by committee investigators if she had ever met Judge Kavanaugh, she said: 'Oh Lord, no.'""

'PART OF WHAT MOTIVATED' CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD WAS TO PUT POLITICAL 'ASTERISK' ON KAVANAUGH, LAWYER ADMITS

In the process of evaluating claims against Kavanaugh, the senators wrote that committee investigators ""collected 25 written statements and spoke with 45 individuals,"" and those investigations ""culminated in the nominee’s confirmation and the release of a 414-page committee report concluding that there was no credible evidence to support any of the allegations.""

The senators asked Wray and Barr to provide an update by Oct. 21. Specifically, the senators requested to know ""for each criminal referral made by the committee to the FBI, did the FBI open a criminal investigation? If so, which investigation(s) resulted in a referral to the Justice Department for prosecution? If not, why not?""

Additionally, the senators asked: ""For each case that was referred to the Justice Department for prosecution, which cases were rejected and which were accepted for prosecution?""

""The next Supreme Court nominee should not have to defend himself or herself against baseless and fabricated allegations, and committee staff should not have to spend valuable time investigating them,"" the senators concluded.

MINNEAPOLIS' LIBERAL MAYOR TRYING TO 'BULLY' PRESIDENT TRUMP OUT OF MINNESOTA, SAYS HEAD OF POLICE UNION

Warren's elevated profile is attracting new scrutiny of her policy ideas, including a 2% annual tax on the wealth of individuals with more than $50 million and a 3% tax on the wealth of those with over $1 billion. Senator Bernie Sanders I-Vt., has advanced a similar proposal.

On Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive,"" Wall Street Journal Assistant Editorial Page Editor James Freeman and a panel of experts debated if the Warren plan was feasible and at the least constitutional.

Lincoln Mitchell, who is an Adjunct Associate Professor of Political Science at Columbia University, said Warren's proposal highlights a critical concept about inequality.

HOUSE DEMS SUBPOENA PENTAGON, WHITE HOUSE BUDGET OFFICE IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

“The argument is a wealth tax as opposed to an income tax, and this is important because we often think about inequality in America in terms of income, but real inequality is in terms of wealth,"" said Mitchell.

However, Mitchell conceded that the idea may not be practical. “One thing I would say is that is it a hard tax to implement. How do you really measure somebody’s worth, particularly a very wealthy person? What’s that jewelry collection worth? What’s that rare car collection worth? So there are some impracticalities.”

Fox News contributor and columnist for The Hill, Liz Peek, dismissed the tax plan outright.

“There are a lot of reasons why this tax is unpopular or a lot of economists think it is a bad idea. Number one, it may be unconstitutional,"" said Peek. ""The way taxation is supposed to be laid out is it is supposed to be proportional across all states and this probably would not be.”

Mitchell disagreed with Peek's assessment, saying, “Taxes aimed at wealthier people… have stood up to constitutional scrutiny in the past.”

Peek was not finished in her takedown of Warren's proposal.

“Number two, it’s expropriation of people’s possessions and property,"" she said, adding, “generally speaking, it’s a terrible tax. It’s inefficient. That’s why most… countries that implemented it in the 90’s have taken it off the books. Sweden, for example, put it in place and saw enormous amounts of people and capital flee the country to get away from it and that’s sort of the expectation.”

“France had 42,000 millionaires leave between 2000 and 2014,"" said Republican New York City Council Member Joe Borelli. ""They lost Gerard Depardieu of all people, someone who is quintessentially French.”

“That woke them up,” joked Peek.

Lastly, Peek said the bottom line is that the idea is impractical. “It’s absolutely hideous to administer because a lot of wealthy people own private partnerships, they own private equity assets… it’s a full-employment act for accountants and lawyers because – as we know from the inheritance tax – those things can be extremely hard to measure.”

Mitchell accepted Peek's argument, but insisted the Americans should consider new ways to address wealth inequality. “This notion of taxing wealth as opposed to income and thinking of inequality in America in terms of wealth… to me, it is very important. I don’t know if this policy as it is presented now gets us there.”

He stayed true to his word Monday, participating in his 36th building project with Habitat for Humanity.

Carter, whose birthday was Oct. 1, appeared at the build site with his left eye swollen and bruised. He had a white bandage above his eye. His wife, former First Lady Rosalynn Carter, 92, joined him.

* A national Quinnipiac poll released yesterday found Elizabeth Warren holding onto her narrow lead over Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic nomination, 29% to 26%. Bernie Sanders was third with 16%, and no other candidate topped 5%.

* The same poll found Biden leading Donald Trump in a hypothetical general election match-up by 11 points (51% to 40%), Warren leading Trump by eight points (49% to 41%), and Sanders leading him by seven points (49% to 42%).

* Presidential hopeful Andrew Yang was at 3% in the Quinnipiac poll, which means he’s now the eighth candidate to qualify for the Democrats’ presidential primary debate in November.

* On a related note, we learned yesterday that MSNBC and the Washington Post will co-host the fifth Democratic presidential primary debate on Nov. 20 in Georgia. As NBC News’ report on this added, “The specific location, venue, format and moderators will be announced at a later date.”

* With just a few days remaining ahead of Louisiana’s first round of balloting in the state’s gubernatorial race, the latest Emerson poll found Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) leading the field with 48% – which is awfully close to the 50% threshold he’d need to avoid a runoff and serve a second term. Eddie Rispone (R) was second in the poll with 25%, followed by Ralph Abraham (R) at 19%.

* At home in Vermont yesterday, Bernie Sanders told reporters that in the wake of his heart attack that he’ll have to “change the nature of the campaign a bit.” The independent senator suggested the shift will mean holding fewer campaign events.

* Because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is nothing if not shameless, his re-election campaign yesterday began promoting a Politico article pointing to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao’s alleged favoritism for Kentucky. Chao, of course, is McConnell’s wife. “Mitch McConnell is a Kentucky Asset,” the senator’s team wrote in a tweet highlighting the report.

* Probate judge Steven Reed (D) made history yesterday, becoming the first African-American mayor of Montgomery, Alabama.

* And Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) has thrown her endorsement to Joe Biden, looking past her fellow California senator, Kamala Harris. Feinstein had previously indicated support for Biden in January, but that was before most of the Democratic candidates had formally launched their campaigns. Biden now has five endorsements from sitting U.S. senators, more than any other Democratic candidate."

In the expected runoff, scheduled November 16, the poll shows Edwards leading Abraham, 53% to 38%.

* With Donald Trump slated to hold a rally in Minneapolis this week, there’s apparently a brewing dispute between the president’s campaign team and local officials over security costs associated with the event. It’s why Trump has spent much of the morning lashing out at Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey via Twitter.

* Speaking of Minnesota, Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s Democratic presidential campaign reported a third-quarter fundraising haul of $4.8 million, which isn’t great, but which is more than enough to meet the threshold for the party’s November primary debate. Klobuchar has not, however, yet met the polling threshold to participate in the event.

* The New York Times had an interesting item the other day on prominent members of the Republican Party’s “Never Trump” contingent who’ve since changed their minds. The article noted Erick Erickson, among others, who vowed, “I will not vote for Donald Trump. Ever,” only to recently change direction.

* With Sen. Johnny Isakson (R) stepping down in a couple of months for health reasons, Republicans are lining up to ask Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) to appoint them to the seat. Among the latest is former Rep. Jack Kingston (R), who lost in his Senate bid in 2014, and who last week reminded the governor’s office that he’s “aggressively defended President Trump at every turn” and “spent 30 years taking on the Democrats’ misguided agenda.”

* With only four weeks remaining in Kentucky’s gubernatorial race, the Democratic Governors Association is running this ad targeting Gov. Matt Bevin (R) for trying to derail the state’s Medicaid-expansion program, which is a story we discussed in some detail a few years ago.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., admitted Tuesday he ""was dumb"" and ignored warning signs of a health condition in the months leading up to his heart attack last week.

""I must confess, I was dumb,"" the 2020 presidential candidate said outside his home in Burlington, Vt. ""Thank God, I have a lot of energy during this campaign. I've been doing, in some cases, three or four rallies a day, going all over the state, Iowa, New Hampshire, wherever. And yet I, in the last month or two, just was more fatigued than I usually have been.""

""I should have listened to those symptoms,"" the 78-year-old presidential hopeful said.

BERNIE SANDERS RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL, DOCTORS SAY HE SUFFERED HEART ATTACK

Sanders revealed that he never had a doctor in his Vermont hometown, ""let alone a cardiologist,"" because his primary physician is based in Washington, D.C.

""We're going to meet him,"" Sanders said moments before getting in a car with his wife, Jane, to attend the appointment with his new physician. ""I understand he's a very good cardiologist. Going to see him on a regular basis to get some checkups, and obviously, I'll be on-and-off in Vermont and so we're going to meet him today.""

Sanders insisted he was ""feeling good,"" adding that he doesn't think the heart attack, for which he had two stents inserted into his chest to help with blood flow, ""helps or hurts"" his chances of beating President Trump in 2020.

His campaign also downplayed any skepticism that his ailments would have a negative impact on his presidential run.

""Make no mistake, Sen. Bernie Sanders is as committed — more so, even more now than he always has been, if that's even possible,"" national campaign co-chair Nina Turner told the Associated Press in an interview.

Sanders is scheduled to attend the fourth Democratic presidential debate in Ohio next week. He said Tuesday that he ""certainly intends to be actively campaigning"" but will ""change the nature"" and frequency of rallies and events to ""make sure I have the strength to do what I have to do.""

“We were doing, you know, in some cases five or six meetings a day, three or four rallies and town meetings and meeting with groups of people,” Sanders said about his campaign prior to his heart attack. “I don’t think I’m going to do that.”

Even before Sanders was rushed to the hospital after complaints of chest pains during a campaign rally in Nevada last week, the candidate faced questions about his age. The 78-year-old is the oldest candidate in the race and would be the oldest person to be elected president, should he win.

Sanders said he still plans to release his medical records, promising to do so ""at the appropriate time.""

A spokesperson for Sanders did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.

""If there's any message that I hope we can get out there, is that I want people to pay attention to their symptoms,"" Sanders said. ""When you're hurting, when you're fatigued, when you have pain in your chest, listen to it.""

Sanders received another piece of bad news on Tuesday. His daughter-in-law, 46-year-old Rainè Riggs, died at a Pennsylvania hospital two days after being diagnosed with cancer, according to an obituary posted on the Lee & Martin Funeral Home Facebook page.

Riggs was married to Sanders' son Levi and the couple has three children.

Councilman Adam Roof, who wrote the resolution which passed in a 10-2 vote, argued all residents of the city are impacted by decisions made at City Hall, and therefore should be allowed to vote regardless of citizenship status.

“The right to vote is more important now than ever before,"" Roof told WCAX-TV. ""All residents have the right, in my eyes, to participate in the local democratic process, and the highest level of participation in that process is being able to cast your vote,""

He said the resolution aligns with the city's 2014 Diversity and Equity Strategic Plan to create a more engaged community. More than 3,000 residents are ineligible to vote due to their status as refugees, the resolution said.

One resident spoke out against the measure, accusing the council of ""political pandering"" to voters.

""We have 40,000-plus registered voters,"" the unidentified resident said. ""How many of those are nonresident college students who vote on our property taxes, our legislators, our city leadership -- which includes all of you -- and much more, and then move away?""

Burlington, the hometown of Democratic socialist presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, has a population of approximately 42,000 people. It is also home to the University of Vermont, which has more than 10,000 undergraduate students.

Council President Kurt Wright said he voted against the legislation because he believes only American citizens should be able to vote.

“I think that’s important. I would not expect to move to another country and not become a citizen and expect to be voting in their elections,” said Wright, a Republican. “We voted on this just a few years ago and the citizens of Burlington voted significantly against it so I’m not supportive of this proposal.”

The measure still needs approval from the state Legislature before it becomes law."

The new national poll showed Warren, a Massachusetts senator, holding a slight edge – but within the margin of error – over the former vice president in the race for their party’s 2020 nomination.

The poll, released Tuesday by Quinnipiac University, was the latest in a slew of national and early voting state surveys in recent weeks showing Warren has surged to a virtual tie with Biden in the primary battle.

""They're always nervous and they want Biden to be more combative. From your perspective, they want him to really go after Trump in a vicious way, and Biden is just not their guy right now.

The former vice president’s $750 billion higher education plan represents a major expansion of the federal government’s role in educating Americans beyond high school. But Biden’s pitch Tuesday is not as sweeping as proposals from his 2020 rivals Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both of whom offer plans exceeding the $1 trillion mark.

JOE BIDEN UNVEILS NEW STRATEGY TO DEAL WITH GROWING UKRAINE CONTROVERSY

The competing approaches reflect Democrats’ efforts to address spiking tuition costs in the United States and the $1.5 trillion-plus in student debt held by about 45 million Americans. The party’s education policy divide is similar to the gap that separates Biden from the two progressive senators on health care, with the former vice president proposing to expand the federal government’s role in the existing health insurance market, while Warren and Sanders propose a single-payer insurance system that would see the federal government essentially replace private insurance altogether.

Jill Biden, the candidate’s wife and a longtime community college professor, explained her husband’s approach.

“My students inspire me,” she said in a conference call with reporters, “and they ask for one thing in return: opportunity.”

The crux of Biden’s higher education plan is a federal-state partnership to cover community college tuition and technical training. Biden calls for the federal government to cover 75 percent of the tuition costs, with states covering the rest. That’s a similar financing concept to the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and the disabled, with states required to cover some costs to qualify for federal money to cover the majority of the program.

Biden proposes that the federal government cover 95 percent of the community college tuition cost at Native Americans’ tribal campuses.

Sanders and Warren propose universal, free access to all undergraduate public colleges and universities.

On student debt, Biden’s more limited approach calls for doubling the Pell Grant program for low-income Americans and cutting in half the income percentage caps on student loan repayments. Borrowers now must pay up to 10 percent of their discretionary income. Biden calls for capping payments at 5 percent of discretionary income, while also delaying payments for anyone making less than $25,000, with the borrower accruing no additional interest.

Biden’s plan would forgive any remaining debt after 20 years of payments and would allow borrowers to get out of their debts as part of personal bankruptcy.

Sanders, conversely, proposes eliminating all student loan debt, while Warren calls for broad debt relief based on income. Warren’s idea would cancel $50,000 in debt for each person with household income under $100,000, with additional proportional relief for those making up to $250,000 annually.

Biden and Warren have another noticeable split on for-profit colleges, which have come under scrutiny because their graduates have a much higher default rate on loans as they struggle to find quality jobs. Biden proposes tighter regulations on those colleges to stop them “from profiteering off of students.” Warren calls for banning such businesses from getting federal money altogether.

All three Democratic hopefuls point to proposed tax increases to pay for their spending. Sanders would tax Wall Street transactions. Warren points to her “wealth tax,” 2 cents on every dollar of a household’s net worth beyond $50 million. Biden calls for eliminating certain breaks in inheritance taxes and capping itemized deductions for the wealthiest Americans."

'WOLF OF WALL STREET' FILM COMPANY TO PAY $60M SETTLEMENT

Belfort’s early life and crimes were portrayed in the blockbuster Hollywood movie, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, “The Wolf of Wall Street.” Belfort served 22 months in prison between 2004 and 2006 for securities fraud totaling over $200 million. He was also ordered to give back $110 million to investors.

The film was based on a book written by Belfort. He said that becoming sober and writing the book were pivotal experiences on his road to rehabilitation.

“When I wrote the book it was like… self-therapy to look back and examine all your actions… I love the movie—obviously, some things were fictionalized to serve the narrative so to speak… There are some things that bothered me that I thought made me look worse than I was and other things that probably didn't look as bad as I was,” said Belfort on Fox Nation's ""No Interruption.""

The 2013 film reportedly made about $400 million worldwide and contributed to kicking off Belfort’s second career as a motivation speaker.

“In terms of what you did and what brought the charges and what brought the guilty plea -- do you have remorse for that?” asked Lahren.

“Of course, I'm remorseful about what happened,” answered Belfort.

“Do you think jail rehabilitated you in a way? Gave you a chance to reflect?” Lahren pressed.

“I deserved to go to jail… I definitely deserved to go to jail, it was definitely a positive experience,” said Belfort. “I thought the judge was very smart… he sentenced me to a long enough time to really like… I'll never forget—that was terrible. Yet not long enough to destroy my life, destroy my children.”

Later in the interview, Lahren asked Belfort to weigh in on the current 2020 Democratic field, as leading candidates like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren call for a crackdown on Wall Street and financial institutions.

“Wall Street has a really, really important function, right? When Wall Street runs amuck, it gets really ugly. What frightens me about a Bernie Sanders or an Elizabeth Warren is like they think that government is… the answer… The policies that they're talking about will literally destroy the fabric of the country,” Belfort said.

However, Belfort said that he’s confident that Trump will win in 2020.

“If I didn't, I wouldn't be able to sleep at night, OK? Because I think that this nation would be literally destroyed. If one of these people gets into office—a Warren or Sanders—destruction.”

Lastly, Lahren asked Belfort if he identified with Trump.

“He's a great salesman… I wish that he would say things in a way that p*** people off less because it doesn't help… but I can’t judge because he's president. I didn't become president, he did. I went to jail.”

The network said it would wait to announce the format, moderators, and specific location but did announce it would host the debate in cooperation with The Washington Post.

It also commented on which Democrats appeared to qualify for the debate. As of Tuesday, the field included former Vice President Joe Biden, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

For the fifth debate, Democratic candidates need to receive 165,000 unique donors -- including 600 spread out over 20 states -- and reach 3 percent in ""four qualifying state or national polls."" They can also make the stage with 5 percent in two qualifying state polls.

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY DEBATE

According to the announcement, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro have yet to meet the polling requirements.

NBC hosted the first Democratic primary debate in June with anchors Chuck Todd, Savannah Guthrie, Lester Holt, Jose Diaz-Balart, and Rachel Maddow. That debate sparked an early controversy between Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who also qualified for the fifth debate, after the former made controversial comments about racial issues.

Since June, the 2020 field has narrowed but at least 12 remained and qualified for the fourth debate set to take place in Ohio. That debate will be hosted by CNN and The New York Times on Oct. 15. Given the much smaller field, NBC can apparently avoid the two-night format of the first debate.

The DNC announced that the fourth-round debate would also be held on a single night. The 10 contenders who faced off in September automatically qualified for the October debate. And Gabbard and Steyer, who narrowly missed the September cut, reached the thresholds to qualify for the upcoming showdown by the deadline.

Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., announced Tuesday she is endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary -- choosing her former longtime Senate colleague over Kamala Harris, her fellow California Democratic senator.

Feinstein’s endorsement, the first major Democratic endorsement by a top legislator this campaign season, comes as Biden has been losing ground in the polls in the wake of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump and a series of high-profile gaffes while on the stump. But the longtime California senator praised the former vice president for his long tenure in Washington and his work on gun control.

“I’ve worked closely with Vice President Biden and I’ve seen firsthand his legislative ability, his statesmanship, and most importantly his moral fortitude,” Feinstein said in a statement. “During his time in Congress and in the White House, Joe Biden has been a tireless fighter for hard-working American families.”

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING DEMOCRATIC 2020 DEBATE

She added: “By making gun reform one of the pillars of his campaign and policy platform, Joe Biden demonstrates that he clearly recognizes what is needed to keep Americans safe. And I know, as president, he will continue the fight to restore the soul of the nation from the Oval Office.”

Feinstein’s endorsement of Biden may seem like a snub to Harris – a first-term senator and former California attorney general – but it hardly comes out of left field, as just last week she held a fundraiser for the former vice president in her home in San Francisco. Also back in January – following Biden’s campaign launch – Feinstein said that “he brings a level of experience and seniority which I think is really important,"" according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

The endorsement from Feinstein – a longtime liberal lawmaker who was first elected in 1992 – comes as Biden is struggling to hold on to his role as Democratic frontrunner. An average of recent polls compiled by Real Clear Politics has Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren virtually tied at the top of the Democratic race.

Warren, however, has surged in recent months in the polls, while Biden has dropped, and far surpassed him during the most recent quarter of fundraising.

Harris, meanwhile, sits in a distant fifth in the Real Clear Politics average, behind Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg."

WARREN UNDER FIRE FOR BIOGRAPHY, AGAIN

CBS News: “On the campaign trail, Elizabeth Warren often tells the story of how she was fired from her first teaching job in 1971 because she was pregnant, a pivotal moment that ultimately put her on a path to Harvard, the United States Senate, and quite possibly the presidency. But recently, several media outlets have questioned the veracity of these claims. In an exclusive interview with CBS News on Monday evening, Warren said she stands by her characterizations of why she left the job. ‘All I know is I was 22 years old, I was 6 months pregnant, and the job that I had been promised for the next year was going to someone else. The principal said they were going to hire someone else for my job,’ she said. … Asked by CBS News why she told the story differently at Berkeley a decade ago, Warren said her life since her election to the Senate in 2012 caused her to ‘open up’ about her past. … The Washington Free Beacon reported on a transcript from contemporaneous local school board meetings, also obtained by CBS News, which said Warren was rehired that spring and that the board ‘accepted with regret’ her ‘resignation’ the following summer.”



Ed Kilgore: The emerging anybody-but-Warren campaign - NY Mag: “But the problem with Warren that we are beginning to hear about most frequently is the claim that she’s just ‘too liberal’ or ‘too far left’ for otherwise persuadable voters (or donors) to countenance. Thus, in theory, she will lose swing voters that, say, Joe Biden might win, in part because her anti-corporate rhetoric and progressive policy positions will play into the Trump campaign’s clearly planned message that Democrats are all godless, baby-killing, America-hating socialists. Where is this argument coming from, if Warren is leading Trump in trial heats and becoming steadily more popular? Pretty clearly, corporate voices from Wall Street to Silicon Valley are taking the lead in demonizing her, for good reason: She’s a threat to their bottom lines and their all-but-sovereign business practices.”



Pennsylvanians unimpressed with 2020 Dems - FOX43: “Pennsylvania's presidential primary in 2020 is among the latest in the country. Only 10 states have primary dates later than April 28. … Of the 650 registered voters polled, 307 were registered Democrats. Of them, a majority of people (52%) say they are still undecided when it comes to who they plan to vote for in the Democratic presidential primary. Former Vice President Joe Biden still has the most interest among candidates with 17 percent of Democrats polled saying they would vote for him… Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren (9%) and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg (8%) both polled ahead of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders at 6 percent.”



Team Bernie want him to use heart attack to show personal side - WaPo: “Prominent friends and supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) say he should cut back on his relentless campaign pace and speak openly about his recent heart attack when he returns to the campaign trail, urging a shift toward a more personal and less hectic campaign than he has run so far. The comments reflect what supporters describe as a deeply personal decision with big implications for Sanders’s candidacy: how the 78-year-old democratic socialist, viewed by many of his backers as the leader of a movement, should proceed following a health scare that has sidelined him for days and raised questions about whether he can — or should — maintain the punishing demands of a presidential campaign. … Sanders supporters privately acknowledge concern that the heart attack could give voters second thoughts about the candidate, who would be the oldest president in history if elected.”



Klobuchar raises $4.8 million - Politico: “Democrat Amy Klobuchar raised $4.8 million between July and the end of September, her campaign announced Monday, a total that bested the Minnesota Senator’s haul from the previous quarter by $1 million. Klobuchar’s third-quarter fundraising was a fraction of the amount raised by top Democratic candidates such as Bernie Sanders, who raised the most of any candidate in the field, $25.3 million. But it is likely enough to keep Klobuchar’s campaign functioning as she attempts to secure more support. Klobuchar has qualified for the October Democratic debate and has crossed the donor threshold for the November debate, giving her opportunities to keep making the case for her presidential bid to a national audience.”



THE RULEBOOK: KEEP IT TOGETHER, PEOPLE

“If, on the other hand, they find us either destitute of an effectual government (each State doing right or wrong, as to its rulers may seem convenient), or split into three or four independent and probably discordant republics or confederacies … what a poor, pitiful figure will America make in their eyes!” – John Jay, Federalist No. 4



TIME OUT: CONSEQUENTIAL COW

History: “On October 8, 1871, flames spark in the Chicago barn of Patrick and Catherine O’Leary, igniting a two-day blaze that kills between 200 and 300 people, destroys 17,450 buildings, leaves 100,000 homeless and causes an estimated $200 million (in 1871 dollars; $3 billion in 2007 dollars) in damages. Legend has it that a cow kicked over a lantern in the O’Leary barn and started the fire, but other theories hold that humans or even a comet may have been responsible for the event that left four square miles of the Windy City, including its business district, in ruins. Dry weather and an abundance of wooden buildings, streets and sidewalks made Chicago vulnerable to fire. …Despite the fire’s devastation, much of Chicago’s physical infrastructure, including its water, sewage and transportation systems, remained intact. Reconstruction efforts began quickly and spurred great economic development and population growth, as architects laid the foundation for a modern city featuring the world’s first skyscrapers.”

SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT CLIMBING

WaPo: “A majority of Americans say they endorse the decision by House Democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry of President Trump, and nearly half of all adults also say the House should take the additional step and recommend that the president be removed from office, according to a Washington Post-Schar School poll. … The poll finds that, by a margin of 58 percent to 38 percent, Americans say the House was correct to undertake the inquiry. ... More than 8 in 10 Democrats endorse the inquiry and nearly 8 in 10 favor a vote to recommend that Trump be removed from office. Among Republicans, roughly 7 in 10 do not support the inquiry but almost 3 in 10 do, and almost one-fifth of Republicans say they favor a vote recommending his removal. Among the critical voting bloc of independents, support for the impeachment inquiry hits 57 percent, with 49 percent saying the House should vote to remove Trump from office.”



Trump digs in - NYT: “The Trump administration directed a top American diplomat involved in its pressure campaign on Ukraine not to appear Tuesday morning for a scheduled interview in the House’s impeachment inquiry. The decision to block Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, from speaking with investigators for three House committees is certain to provoke an immediate conflict with potentially profound consequences for the White House and President Trump. House Democrats have repeatedly warned that if the administration tries to interfere with their investigation, it will be construed as obstruction, a charge they see as potentially worthy of impeachment. Democrats from the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees did not immediately respond on Tuesday.”



Graham offers Giuliani a stage to fight back - Fox News: “Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has offered President Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, a chance to come before lawmakers to detail his allegations about former Vice President Joe Biden and his dealings with Ukraine. ‘Have heard on numerous occasions disturbing allegations by [Giuliani] about corruption in Ukraine and the many improprieties surrounding the firing of former Prosecutor-General Viktor Shokin,’ Graham said Tuesday on Twitter. ‘Therefore I will offer to Mr. Giuliani the opportunity to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to inform the committee of his concerns.’ Giuliani told Fox News on Tuesday he intends to testify, but needs to go over the offer with the other attorneys involved to determine whether they could sort out issues regarding attorney-client privilege and executive privilege.”



House Dems try to keep whistleblower secret - WaPo: “House Democrats are weighing extraordinary steps to secure testimony from a whistleblower whose complaint prompted their impeachment inquiry, masking his identity to prevent President Trump’s congressional allies from exposing the individual, according to three officials familiar with the deliberations. The steps under consideration include having the whistleblower testify from a remote location and obscuring the individual’s appearance and voice, these officials said. The efforts reflect Democrats’ deepening distrust of their GOP colleagues, whom they see as fully invested in defending a president who has attacked the whistleblower’s credibility and demanded absolute loyalty from Republicans. ‘There are lots of different protocols and procedures we’re looking into to find out what works and doesn’t work to protect the identity of the whistleblower,’ said a person familiar with the talks.”



Perry under pressure - Politico: “Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Monday denied that he pressed the Ukrainian government to put two U.S. businessmen on the board of the state energy company or that he was planning to leave the Trump administration. … Perry acknowledged making the recommendations to Ukraine’s state-owned natural gas company Naftogaz, but said he did so only at the request of that country’s government. He also said it was ‘true’ that he had pressed President Donald Trump to make the July call to Zelensky that is at the center of the impeachment inquiry. … Perry also denied he was planning to step down from his position, which POLITICO, the New York Times and Washington Post reported last week. ‘I’m here. I’m serving. They’ve been writing the story that I was leaving the Department of Energy for at least nine months now.’”

“We're all different and I think that we've forgotten that that's okay that we're all different… but just because I don't agree with someone on everything doesn't mean that I'm not going to be friends with them.” – Ellen DeGeneres’ response after receiving backlash for appearing at a Dallas Cowboys football game next to former President George W. Bush, whom she calls a friend.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Chris, you sounded like a Democrat politician when you dodged a direct answer to Meredith Shoemaker’s question [on Monday]. She did not ask you what you thought of President Trump’s call with the Ukrainian President. She asked you very directly ‘what law did President Trump break?’ With the impeachment standard being ‘high crimes and misdemeanors,’ Meredith’s question gets to the heart of the matter. Can I give you second chance here? No Democrat talking points, please. What law?” – Kevin Cook, Farmers Branch, Texas



[Ed. note: So I gather you’re not a Democrat, Mr. Cook! The question of a specific criminal statue here isn’t relevant. Congress’ power to impeach and remove is pretty much unlimited. Andrew Johnson’s impeachment, for example, rested on 11 articles, some relating to specific crimes, but check out the 10th and 11th articles here. How about alleging that Johnson acted “to bring into disgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt and reproach” on Congress? It’s not a crime to ridicule Congress, even for the president. But Congress was asserting that Johnson’s efforts to undermine Congress was a breach of his duties under the constitutional. Or think of a hypothetical. What if a president laid up dead drunk every day at the White House or was posting top secret documents on Instagram? Neither of those things would be illegal for the president to do, but both would surely doubt in his or her impeachment. These are political, not legal considerations. Democrats in this case are focusing on the president seeking help from a foreign power against a political opponent, and the Constitution gives them more than enough room to do so.]



“At the risk of being accused of being ‘too cute by a half,’ until Joe Biden receives the Democratic nomination, can he really be considered a ‘political opponent’ for the purpose of prohibiting the President from asking for investigative assistance from a foreign government? Full disclosure – I am a supporter of President Trump.” – Tim Kasparek, Goodyear, Ariz.

SF Gate: “Reptile breeder Brian Gundy had just given a talk and animal presentation Saturday at the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Library in downtown San Jose. While going to get his car parked on the second level of the Fourth and San Fernando Street garage about 4:30 p.m., he left his snakes and lizards in boxes and a bag in a no-parking zone. When he returned for his critters, he made a grim discovery. ‘As I was loading up my gear, I realized the bag that had my four pythons and blue skink lizard inside was gone and they were just there seconds ago,’ Gundy told KTVU Fox 2. Gundy had seen several people walk by his equipment, so he ran after them but couldn't catch up. He told KTVU he doesn't think they knew what was inside. … The stolen animals were worth approximately $5,000, according to the reptile breeder.”

Elizabeth Warren is holding a slight edge over former Vice President Joe Biden in the race for their party’s 2020 nomination.

The poll – released Tuesday by Quinnipiac University – is the latest in a slew of national and early voting state surveys in recent weeks to show Warren has surged and now is virtually tied with Biden in the Democratic primary battle.

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING DEMOCRATIC 2020 DEBATE

The populist senator from Massachusetts who has produced one progressive plan after another stands at 29 percent support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents in the survey. Biden – who for months was the unrivaled front-runner – registers at 26 percent. Warren’s three-point advantage over the former vice president is within the poll’s margin of error.

“Warren maintains her strength in the Democratic primary, which has been consistently growing since the start of her campaign. This poll confirms her status as a co-frontrunner with Biden,"" Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said.

Sen. Bernie Sanders – the progressive independent from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House run – received 16 percent support.

Warren was at 27 percent, Biden 25 percent, and Sanders 16 percent in Quinnipiac's last Democratic primary poll, which was released two weeks ago.

QUESTIONS MOUNT OVER WARREN'S STUMP SPEECH STORY THAT SHE LOST HER TEACHING JOB BECAUSE SHE WAS PREGNANT

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is a distant fourth, at 4 percent, in the new survey. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang stand at 3 percent in the survey. Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota register at 2 percent, with everyone one else in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential candidates coming in at 1 percent or less.

Biden tops President Trump 51-40 percent in a hypothetical general election matchup. But that’s down from a 16 percentage point lead over the GOP president in Quinnipiac’s late August poll. Warren’s ahead of Trump by eight points in the new survey, down from a 12-point lead in August. And Sanders beat the president by 7 points, down from a 14 point lead in the previous poll.

The new poll also indicates that registered voters nationwide remain divided over impeaching and removing the president from office over the Ukrainian crisis.

IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY GETS MAJORITY SUPPORT IN NEW POLL

Forty-five percent of registered voters say Trump should be impeached and removed from office, with 49 percent opposing such a move. Voters were evenly split at 47 percent in last week’s Quinnipiac survey. But a Quinnipiac poll released late last month – before news of the Ukrainian crisis broke – indicated support for impeachment at just 37 percent.

The new poll indicates 53-43 percent majority support for impeachment inquiry being conducted the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, a slight uptick from 52-45 percent backing for the investigation a week ago.

As expected, there’s a vast partisan divide, with 92 percent of Democrats saying the inquiry’s legitimate and 88 percent of Republicans calling it a witch hunt. By a 52-40 percent margin, independents say the investigation into Trump is legitimate.

Trump’s under fire over his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter over their dealings in the eastern European country that’s been battling Russia this decade. Fueled by whistleblower complaints and a read-out of the call released by the White House, Democrats argue the president was asking a foreign country to potentially interfere in a U.S. election.

Trump has repeatedly insisted that he did nothing wrong and has on numerous occasions described his conversation with the Ukrainian leader as “perfect.”

The president and allies have instead tried to put the spotlight in the scandal on Biden, a political rival who’s hoping to face off against the president in next year’s election.

Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – who had been widely accused by both Democrats and Republicans of overlooking corruption in his own office – was later dismissed.

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted October 4-7, with 1,483 self-identified registered voters questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, with a sampling error of plus or minus 4.7 percent for questions to the 646 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents."

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said she is committed to forgoing big-money fundraisers if she wins the Democratic nomination, no matter how much money President Trump pulls in from his supporters.

""I’m not going to go do the big-dollar fund-raisers. I’m just not going to do it,” Warren told CBS in an interview posted Tuesday. The 2020 hopeful said that her campaign was predicated on the notion ""that we can build this together. And that’s exactly what we’re doing.”

CBS reporter Zak Hudak had asked Warren whether she could guarantee her supporters she wouldn't utilize big-dollar fundraisers.

Warren claimed that without financial independence, candidates would continue serving wealthy interests after they were elected to office.

DEMS PUBLICLY TOUT SMALL DOLLAR DONATIONS WHILE QUIETLY COURTING BIG DOLLAR DONORS

""I will not be forced to make changes in how I raise money,” Warren said. “Look, for me, this is pretty straightforward. Either you think democracy works and electing a president is all about going behind closed doors with bazillionaires and corporate executives and lobbyists and scooping up as much money as possible.

""Or you think it’s about a grass-roots, let’s build this from the ground up.”

That answer appeared to represent a reversal for Warren after she expressed openness to big-dollar donors in a general election. Not doing so, she indicated, was ""unilateral disarmament.""

""We’ll be up against a Republican machine that will be hell-bent on keeping the White House,"" she told MSNBC in February. ""They will have PACs and Super PACs and too many special interest groups to count, and we will do what is necessary to match them financially. That means investing -- starting now -- in each and every one of our state parties, and in our national party too.”

It's unclear what was behind Warren's apparent reversal but her comments came just days after her campaign announced it had raised $24.6 million from more than half a million individual donors in the third quarter of this year. That was substantially higher than the $15.2 million raised by former Vice President Joe Biden but slightly lower than the $25.3 million raised by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

If Warren wins the Democratic nomination, she would likely face an incumbent candidate backed by a Republican Party that has recorded record-breaking fundraising numbers.

In the third quarter alone, the Republican National Committee and President Trump's campaign raised $125 million. Within just 24 hours in September, those two entities raked in an eye-popping $5 million -- an apparent backlash to the formal impeachment inquiry announced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. So far in 2019, those two organizations have raised $308 million.

TIME FOR A RE-PETE?

What’s so great about fourth place?



If you’re South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, quite a lot actually.



Readers have no doubt been watching Elizabeth Warren’s steady gains against front-runner Joe Biden in recent weeks. She is now just 2.4 points behind Biden in our Democratic 2020 Power Ranking. As Biden continues to struggle with the enhanced scrutiny on his family’s buck raking facilitated by Biden’s proximity to power, we expect his troubles to continue.



While Democrats are loath to publically agree with President Trump, the facts of the case of Trump’s likely impeachment reinforce Biden’s strongest negatives: That he has been around too long and is too much of a swamp creature.



We know Biden supporters are preparing to spend millions to prop up the former Delaware senator in his third presidential quest, but it is hard to imagine that Biden could persist for long in second place.



When electability is your cri de coeur it’s hard to keep voters around when you don’t look so electable.



This is good news for Warren, no doubt. But she had better be worried that it is good news come too soon. As Biden is currently experiencing, being the frontrunner is not all aviator sunglasses and waffle cones.



Warren has long enjoyed kid-glove treatment from the press, with relatively little scrutiny on her very ambitious policy proposals. She has also gotten a couple of mulligans on biographical boo-boos. That won’t last if she gets out in front. The steady diet of opposition research that will fill reporters’ inboxes will see to that.



So cast your eyes down the list. You can skip over poor Bernie Sanders who is struggling not just with his own health issues, but with the tragic loss of his daughter-in-law. The Vermont senator has said he will scale back his campaigning, and is already 10 points behind Warren and falling.



Buttigieg, though, has been climbing. Perhaps the beneficiary of the unraveling of California Sen. Kamala Harris’ misbegotten campaign or perhaps some Biden skeptics defecting, Buttigieg is a man on the move.



Certainly Sens. Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar are hoping that they would see their boats lifted by the melting of Biden’s iceberg, but Buttigieg may have the best case to make.



His fundraising haul in the third quarter says that he will have the resources to go the distance and his moderate-sounding appeal to voters would position him nicely to pick up the business-friendly Democratic donors who are terrified of either a Warren defeat or victory.



Whether Buttigieg can capitalize on the opportunity will depend on his ability to go toe-to-toe with Warren. In the first Buttigieg craze, he wasn’t able to translate interest into hard support. In a second go-around he’d have to play for keeps.



SANDERS TO SCALE BACK CAMPAIGN AFTER HEART SURGERY

WaPo: “[Bernie Sanders] visited a cardiologist Tuesday morning, and when he returned, he told reporters, ‘We’re gonna change the nature of the campaign a bit.’ ‘Probably not doing four rallies a day,’ said Sanders, who had adopted a more furious campaign schedule than many of his much younger opponents. Sanders, who has committed to releasing his medical records before the first primary votes but has not yet done so, said Tuesday he would provide the information at ‘the appropriate time.’ Former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — fellow septuagenarians who join Sanders at the top of most polls — have also committed to releasing their medical records.”



Daughter-in-law, 46, killed by rare cancer - USA Today: “The daughter-in-law of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has died, shortly after being diagnosed with cancer. Rainè Riggs was 46. The Lee & Martin Funeral Home in Burgettstown, Pennsylvania, says Riggs died Saturday, the day Sanders returned to Vermont after suffering a heart attack. Her obituary said she was diagnosed with neuroendocrine cancer. Riggs, a neuropsychologist, was married to Levi Sanders, who ran unsuccessfully for a New Hampshire congressional seat in 2018. Riggs' obituary says she met Levi Sanders while the two worked at an emergency food shelter in Vermont. The obituary said Riggs was the director of behavioral medicine at Dartmouth Medical School for several years, and she started the Palliative Care Department for Dartmouth Medical Center. She also owned Riggs Geriatric Psychology in Windsor, Vermont. Riggs and Sanders had three children.”



Dianne Feinstein endorses Biden, snubs Harris - Fox News: “Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., announced Tuesday she is endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary -- choosing her former longtime Senate colleague over Kamala Harris, her fellow California Democratic senator. Feinstein’s endorsement, the first major Democratic endorsement by a top legislator this campaign season, comes as Biden has been losing ground in the polls in the wake of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump and a series of high-profile gaffes while on the stump. But the longtime California senator praised the former vice president for his long tenure in Washington and his work on gun control. ‘I’ve worked closely with Vice President Biden and I’ve seen firsthand his legislative ability, his statesmanship, and most importantly his moral fortitude,’ Feinstein said in a statement.”



THE RULEBOOK: SUFFICIENT RESOURCES

“I believe it may be regarded as a position warranted by the history of mankind, that, IN THE USUAL PROGRESS OF THINGS, THE NECESSITIES OF A NATION, IN EVERY STAGE OF ITS EXISTENCE, WILL BE FOUND AT LEAST EQUAL TO ITS RESOURCES.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 30



TIME OUT: ‘YESTERDAY’ CAME SUDDENLY

On this day in 1965, The Beatles’ “Yesterday” began its month-long reign as the top single in the U.S. The song, Paul McCartney’s masterwork, started as a dream. The Telegraph [U.K.]: “As McCartney explained in 1980: ‘I woke up with a lovely tune in my head. I thought, 'That’s great, I wonder what that is?' There was an upright piano next to me, to the right of the bed by the window. I got out of bed, sat at the piano, found G, found F sharp minor 7th – and that leads you through then to B to E minor, and finally back to E. It all leads forward logically. I liked the melody a lot but because I’d dreamed it I couldn’t believe I’d written it. I thought, ‘No, I’ve never written like this before.’ But I had the tune, which was the most magic thing.’ McCartney was living in Wimpole Street, London, at the time, at the family home of Jane Asher, who he was dating at the time.”

TRUMP’S IMPEACHMENT PLAN: BURN DOWN THE HOUSE

Axios: “President Trump, while nervous about the historic stain of impeachment, is throwing everything he has into this fight: refusing all cooperation, running ads to profit politically, and torching every person who stands in opposition to him. When it all boils down, Trump really only trusts his own instincts. And his instincts here are the same as they were with the Mueller investigation: Fight like hell. No nuance or apology — not a hint of it. Turn the leader of the investigation (in this case, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff) into a conservative media villain. Condemn Trump enemies in the most incendiary and exaggerated language possible (treason, traitors, coup, etc.). Compared to the Mueller investigation, the Ukraine phone call appears to have more resonance with the general public. Republicans close to leadership and the White House tell Axios they're concerned by trend lines in a Washington Post poll showing 49% of Americans think Trump should be removed from office.”



Partisan lines holding - NBC News: “A majority of Americans say the allegations that President Donald Trump asked a foreign leader to investigate 2020 rival Joe Biden are serious and need to be fully investigated, and they also believe the president hasn’t been honest and truthful about his actions. Still, the public is divided – largely along partisan lines – on whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office, with 43 percent supporting his removal given what they know today, versus 49 percent who oppose it. … According to the poll, 47 percent of Americans believe the allegations that Trump requested Ukraine’s president to look into the Bidens are either ‘quite serious’ or ‘extremely serious.’ That includes 73 percent of Democrats, 55 percent of independents and even 21 percent of Republicans. By contrast, a combined 28 percent dismiss the allegations as either being not serious or false and without merit. Twenty-five percent of respondents say they don’t have an opinion or are unsure.”



Q Poll: Support for impeachment inquiry steady - Quinnipiac University: “After another week with impeachment in the news, registered voters nationwide are still divided on impeaching and removing President Trump from office, with 45 percent saying he should be impeached and removed and 49 percent opposing the idea, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. This compares to last week's poll, in which voters were evenly split on impeaching and removing the president 47 - 47 percent. In a poll released on September 25, before any major news about impeachment, voters were clearly against impeachment 37 - 57 percent. While nearly half of voters do not currently back impeachment, a majority of voters do still approve 53 - 43 percent of the impeachment inquiry being conducted by the U.S. House of Representatives in order to determine whether or not to bring impeachment charges against the president. A week ago, voters approved of the inquiry 52 - 45 percent.”



Gowdy joins Team Trump - Bloomberg: “Donald Trump has enlisted former Representative Trey Gowdy to work with the White House team combating the U.S. House’s impeachment inquiry into the president, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Gowdy, a former prosecutor from South Carolina, is not formally joining the White House staff, according to the people. He was at the White House on Tuesday, according to one person who saw him there, before an eight-page letter was issued to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declaring that Trump and the administration wouldn’t participate in the impeachment inquiry.”



What will become of Mick Mulvaney? - The Atlantic: “[Mick] Mulvaney’s uncertain status says something about Trump’s mind-set. In the face of this latest peril, and nearly 1,000 days into his tenure, he still hasn’t settled on how the West Wing should run. Confronting the impeachment threat is a West Wing staff that Trump has largely neutered. Aides have been left guessing about who’s coming and going, much less what they’re supposed to say about accusations that Trump pressured Ukraine to ferret out dirt on his potential 2020 rival Joe Biden. In the two weeks since the whistle-blower complaint was released to the public, the White House still hasn’t articulated a clear legal, political, or communications strategy needed to withstand impeachment and keep Trump’s Republican support from eroding.”



Watergate lessons for GOP - FiveThirtyEight: “One complicating factor here is that if Republicans were to abandon Trump, history does not suggest that Trump loyalists would easily forgive them for joining the Democrats’ impeachment effort. Even though most Americans did eventually support removing [Richard] Nixon from office, Republican voters were mostly not part of that consensus. Days before he resigned, a Gallup poll found that only 31 percent of Republicans thought Nixon should no longer be president. And some of those supporters deeply resented their representatives for their role in ousting Nixon, which may even have contributed to the Democratic landslide in the 1974 midterm elections.”



SENATE GOP CAMPAIGN ARM RAISES RECORD CASH

WashEx: “The committee tasked with electing Republican senators amid the impeachment battle will report raising $47.7 million so far this year, an amount that is already greater than ever raised before in the year prior to an election year. The National Republican Senatorial Committee is crucial to protecting vulnerable incumbents like Susan Collins of Maine, Cory Gardner of Colorado, and Martha McSally of Arizona. In the three-month period ending Sept. 30, the NRSC raised roughly $13.1 million, including approximately $5 million in September — and made the last payment on a $17 million debt left over from the midterm elections. The NRSC shared these figures with the Washington Examiner on Tuesday, ahead of its upcoming Federal Election Commission filing. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is trying maintain Republican control of the Senate. Currently there are 53 GOP senators in the conference.”



Planned Parenthood preps massive 2020 spending - Fox News: “Planned Parenthood, the behemoth nonprofit organization that provides reproductive health care and is the nation’s largest abortion provider, says it’s making a major investment in the 2020 elections. Planned Parenthood’s political wings – which fight for legal protections for abortion – announced Wednesday that they’ll spend $45 million backing candidates who support abortion rights in elections next year ranging from the state house level to the White House. … The group says its top priority in 2020 is to defeat and unseat President Trump. Other priorities include helping Democrats retake control of the GOP-controlled Senate and holding the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. The group will target roughly 5 million voters across the country, with the spotlight on nine key swing states: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.”



Bevin looks to impeachment backlash to hold on in Kentucky - RCP: “[Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin] has pressed the pending impeachment of President Trump into his own Kentucky reelection effort. Standing outside the governor’s mansion on Friday, Bevin tied his fate to Trump’s by condemning impeachment as ‘an absolute travesty’ and calling on his Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Andy Beshear, to answer a ‘fundamental question’: Will Beshear support or oppose forcing the president from office? The Democrat doesn’t want to answer, and the ensuing drama in a 2019 race could draw a rough sketch of the electoral implications of impeachment in 2020.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I appreciate Ellen DeGeneres’ statement about her friendship with former President George W. Bush. How have we reached this point where we can’t be friends with, or at least be civil to, those who hold a different viewpoint? … The father of Christian Rock, Larry Norman, once told a joke about witnessing to people and the ‘religious’ terminology that is often used. In the story, the Christian becomes frustrated at the end of a conversation he’s been having with a friend because the friend doesn’t understand the terms justification, sanctification, or being saved. In frustration he shouts, ‘I’m trying to tell you the Good News!’ His friend asks, ‘What’s that?’ The Christian responds, ‘You’re going to Hell!’ To which his friend replies, ‘Well, what’s the bad news?’ The point of recounting that is to state that if we hold firm convictions, that’s fine, but we need to convey them in a loving and respectful way. Our actions speak louder than our words. If we’re not mindful of that, we risk offending the person, or worse, losing the opportunity for dialogue that we seek with the other person. I believe that in matters of faith especially, that would be a bad thing. As always, I wish you and your family God’s richest blessings!” – Paul Schnier, Shoreham, N.Y.



[Ed. note: Amen, Mr. Schnier! That goes for politics, too. Persuasion leads to consensus, which leads to durable reforms. Division leads to government by plurality, which leads to lurching. Blessings to you and yours, too.]



“I fully understand your point today about the legal (‘shoot someone on 5th Ave’) and political differences (‘posting TS documents on IG’) when viewing Congress' vested powers to impeach a sitting President. Hopefully this third time is a charm. What about this [Contributions and donations by foreign nationals.] I believe this is what your colleague Judge [Andrew Napolitano] has been referencing in his argument on recent articles and TV shows. … The difference between this and the Mueller/Russia case was that this bordered on bribery in ‘bribes, high crimes and misdemeanors.’ Mueller's case was weak and bordered on emotion. This is a stronger case with a self-admitted crime, No? An independent voter's perspective.” – Jai Suresh, Fremont, Calif.



[Ed. note: I hear you, Mr. Suresh. But, no matter which side you take here, the question of impeachment still isn’t about the law. The question is political, or at best, moral. It is what the members of the House (and the constituents they represent) say it is. Efforts to find specific criminal charges miss the point of the endeavor.]

EAU DE BIG BOY

AP: “An Ohio homeowner never envisioned becoming semi-famous because of a goat butting its way into her home and taking a nap in her bathroom. … The break-in happened Friday when an escaped male goat from a farm several miles away repeatedly butted against a sliding glass door... [Jennifer Keathley’s] 18-year-old son, Logan, discovered the billy goat in the bathroom when he returned home Friday afternoon from school to find the family’s agitated German Shepherd in the driveway, broken glass on the back porch and the house reeking. … Two Ashland County Sheriff’s deputies unsuccessfully tried to coax the goat, named Big Boy, out of the home with carrots, a dog bone and grass. They eventually grabbed him by the horns and dragged him outside… The Keathleys learned their home insurance policy covers damage from bears and deer but not goats. … Despite applications of carpet deodorant and urine neutralizer, she said the odor from Big Boy’s urine still lingers.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“Or more prosaically, the catastrophe that awaits everyone from a single false move, wrong turn, fatal encounter. Every life has such a moment. What distinguishes us is whether — and how — we ever come back.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the National Review on Aug. 17, 2007.

Campos-Duffy's advice for parents was sparked by her recent visit to Marquette University in Wisconsin where she was invited by Young America’s Foundation club (YAF) to speak about the importance of defending American capitalism.

LAURA INGRAHAM: RECANTED HATE CRIME PART OF 'P.C. CULTURE AND A VICTIMOLOGY CULTURE GONE TOTALLY AWRY'

She was confronted by campus protesters and she wrote about it in an op-ed published on Fox Business.

In the piece, Campos-Duffy recalled that she was prepared for her critics, but she was taken by surprise by a Chinese foreign exchange student, who stood up and ""taught all of us that night a lesson in the dangers of romanticizing socialism and communism.""

""After asking a thoughtful question, I asked him if he would explain to the students in the room how the Chinese social credit system worked,"" she wrote.

""He described how the Communist Chinese government tracks its citizens’ phones, internet use, attendance to Communist party events and other activities and uses this 'score' to determine your family’s financial fate, the quality of education your child receives, and whether you will be arrested or punished for thinking the wrong thoughts. I was alarmed by how many of the students in the room were unaware of this fact of life in Communist China.""

On ""Fox and Friends,"" Campos-Duffy said that she came away from that experience with the conviction that parents must step up to teach their children, when educators, politicians and public figures do not.

""What I found on college campuses is -- with the exception of a few ... conservative students -- so many kids are falling for the lies and the promises of 'free'... that are being sold today by [New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], by [Vermont Sen.] Bernie Sanders and by [Massachusetts Sen.] Elizabeth Warren,"" said Campos-Duffy.

""The question is what do you do about it? And my experience is that you have to start young -- you can't wait until your kids come home with the stories from their socialist professors at the university. If you're not having a conversation with your young kids at home then somebody else is,"" she concluded.

Campos-Duffy also previewed an important new episode of her Fox Nation show, ""Moms,"" where she interviews women of all different backgrounds about the challenges of motherhood.

""We actually travel to Texas to meet with real-life moms there, who are dealing with fertility issues, so it's a really heavy topic, but so much hope, so much love and compassion that was shared inside of that story... More people than we think are struggling with this, so its a topic that we really wanted to touch on,"" Campos-Duffy told ""Fox and Friends"" co-host Ainsley Earhardt.

In that episode, which will be available on Fox Nation on October 10, one mother shared her heartbreaking story of turning to in vitro fertilization after the death of her first child.

""We learned about mid-way through our pregnancy that she had some physical abnormalities that led them to believe that there may be genetic abnormalities as wel l... unfortunately when she was born she had a rare lung disease that she passed from, "" she said. ""In order to avoid that happening again and not have to make a choice with each pregnancy, we decided to do IVF -- which led us to our second daughter Avery, and she's 10 months old now.""

MINNEAPOLIS' LIBERAL MAYOR TRYING TO 'BULLY' PRESIDENT TRUMP OUT OF MINNESOTA, SAYS HEAD OF POLICE UNION

Warren's elevated profile is attracting new scrutiny of her policy ideas, including a 2% annual tax on the wealth of individuals with more than $50 million and a 3% tax on the wealth of those with over $1 billion. Senator Bernie Sanders I-Vt., has advanced a similar proposal.

On Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive,"" Wall Street Journal Assistant Editorial Page Editor James Freeman and a panel of experts debated if the Warren plan was feasible and at the least constitutional.

Lincoln Mitchell, who is an Adjunct Associate Professor of Political Science at Columbia University, said Warren's proposal highlights a critical concept about inequality.

HOUSE DEMS SUBPOENA PENTAGON, WHITE HOUSE BUDGET OFFICE IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

“The argument is a wealth tax as opposed to an income tax, and this is important because we often think about inequality in America in terms of income, but real inequality is in terms of wealth,"" said Mitchell.

However, Mitchell conceded that the idea may not be practical. “One thing I would say is that is it a hard tax to implement. How do you really measure somebody’s worth, particularly a very wealthy person? What’s that jewelry collection worth? What’s that rare car collection worth? So there are some impracticalities.”

Fox News contributor and columnist for The Hill, Liz Peek, dismissed the tax plan outright.

“There are a lot of reasons why this tax is unpopular or a lot of economists think it is a bad idea. Number one, it may be unconstitutional,"" said Peek. ""The way taxation is supposed to be laid out is it is supposed to be proportional across all states and this probably would not be.”

Mitchell disagreed with Peek's assessment, saying, “Taxes aimed at wealthier people… have stood up to constitutional scrutiny in the past.”

Peek was not finished in her takedown of Warren's proposal.

“Number two, it’s expropriation of people’s possessions and property,"" she said, adding, “generally speaking, it’s a terrible tax. It’s inefficient. That’s why most… countries that implemented it in the 90’s have taken it off the books. Sweden, for example, put it in place and saw enormous amounts of people and capital flee the country to get away from it and that’s sort of the expectation.”

“France had 42,000 millionaires leave between 2000 and 2014,"" said Republican New York City Council Member Joe Borelli. ""They lost Gerard Depardieu of all people, someone who is quintessentially French.”

“That woke them up,” joked Peek.

CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP

Lastly, Peek said the bottom line is that the idea is impractical. “It’s absolutely hideous to administer because a lot of wealthy people own private partnerships, they own private equity assets… it’s a full-employment act for accountants and lawyers because – as we know from the inheritance tax – those things can be extremely hard to measure.”

Mitchell accepted Peek's argument, but insisted the Americans should consider new ways to address wealth inequality. “This notion of taxing wealth as opposed to income and thinking of inequality in America in terms of wealth… to me, it is very important. I don’t know if this policy as it is presented now gets us there.”

The letter to Attorney General Bill Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray -- signed by GOP Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, Ted Cruz and John Cornyn of Texas, Mike Crapo of Idaho, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Kennedy of Louisiana and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee -- came as Democrats have sought to relitigate the Kavanaugh issue, with virtually all of the party's 2020 presidential contenders calling for the justice to be impeached.

The first criminal referral, the senators wrote, concerned the ""false allegation made by an individual who told the [Judiciary] Committee that he had direct knowledge that Judge Kavanaugh assaulted a close friend on a boat in the harbor at Newport, Rhode Island in 1985.""

The Twitter account belonging to that accuser apparently advocated for a military coup against the Trump administration. The accuser, who had contacted the office of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., recanted the sexual assault claim on the social media site days later, after an investigation by Senate Republicans.

NEW YORK TIMES UPDATES KAVANAUGH 'BOMBSHELL' WITH ONE MINOR DETAIL -- 'ACCUSER' HAS NO RECOLLECTION OF ALLEGED EPISODE

The second referral involved a claim from disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti and client Julie Swetnick, alleging that Kavanaugh participated in gang-rape trains.

""After a thorough investigation, the committee found no verifiable evidence to support any of the allegations made in the declaration,"" the senators wrote. ""The committee also found that both Mr. Avenatti and Ms. Swetnick had a long history of credibility issues and may have criminally conspired to mislead the committee and obstruct its investigation.""

EX-BOYFRIEND TELLS FOX NEWS THAT SWETNICK THREATENED TO KILL UNBORN CHILD, ALWAYS EXAGGERATED STORIES

The third referral specifically implicated Avenatti, who submitted a ""sworn statement by an unknown declarant claimed that Judge Kavanaugh had spiked the punch at house parties with Quaaludes and/or grain alcohol."" NBC News later reported that the apparent declarant had said Avenatti ""twisted her words.""

The final referral concerned a claim by Judy Munro-Leighton, who had sent an email to the Judiciary Committee indicating that she was ""the author of an unsigned letter containing highly graphic sexual-assault accusations against Judge Kavanaugh previously received by the office of Senator Kamala Harris."" But, when committee staff later interviewed her, ""she admitted that she falsely identified herself as the author of the letter and its allegations and had only claimed authorship 'as a way to grab attention.'""

The letter added: ""When asked by committee investigators if she had ever met Judge Kavanaugh, she said: 'Oh Lord, no.'""

'PART OF WHAT MOTIVATED' CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD WAS TO PUT POLITICAL 'ASTERISK' ON KAVANAUGH, LAWYER ADMITS

In the process of evaluating claims against Kavanaugh, the senators wrote that committee investigators ""collected 25 written statements and spoke with 45 individuals,"" and those investigations ""culminated in the nominee’s confirmation and the release of a 414-page committee report concluding that there was no credible evidence to support any of the allegations.""

The senators asked Wray and Barr to provide an update by Oct. 21. Specifically, the senators requested to know ""for each criminal referral made by the committee to the FBI, did the FBI open a criminal investigation? If so, which investigation(s) resulted in a referral to the Justice Department for prosecution? If not, why not?""

Additionally, the senators asked: ""For each case that was referred to the Justice Department for prosecution, which cases were rejected and which were accepted for prosecution?""

""The next Supreme Court nominee should not have to defend himself or herself against baseless and fabricated allegations, and committee staff should not have to spend valuable time investigating them,"" the senators concluded.

* On a related note, the Vermont senator said he knew about the heart attack for a few days before it was disclosed to the public, but Sanders added that he’s nevertheless comfortable with the way his campaign handled the matter. “No apologies,” he said.

* Joe Biden yesterday made an unequivocal statement in support for Donald Trump’s impeachment, a step he’d previously been reluctant to take.

* On a related note, the former vice president’s campaign sent a written complaint to New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet yesterday, questioning the newspaper’s decision to publish an op-ed from Peter Schweizer and pointing to what Team Biden sees as a larger pattern of “journalistic malpractice.”

* And speaking of Biden’s campaign, it also reached out to Facebook about taking down a Trump campaign attack ad that includes demonstrably false claims. The social-media giant refused.

* Despite having qualified for next week’s Democratic presidential primary debate, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) is now saying she may boycott the event in order to protest a process she believes is “rigged” against her and candidates like her.

* Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said this week that she would continue to forgo big-dollar fundraising events, even if she wins her party’s presidential nomination next year. The senator later clarified, however, that she’d headline high-dollar events for the Democratic Party, but not to benefit her own campaign directly.

* And Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas) was planning to retire at the end of this Congress, but she announced late yesterday that she’ll run for re-election one last time next year."

* A national Quinnipiac poll released yesterday found Elizabeth Warren holding onto her narrow lead over Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic nomination, 29% to 26%. Bernie Sanders was third with 16%, and no other candidate topped 5%.

* The same poll found Biden leading Donald Trump in a hypothetical general election match-up by 11 points (51% to 40%), Warren leading Trump by eight points (49% to 41%), and Sanders leading him by seven points (49% to 42%).

* Presidential hopeful Andrew Yang was at 3% in the Quinnipiac poll, which means he’s now the eighth candidate to qualify for the Democrats’ presidential primary debate in November.

* On a related note, we learned yesterday that MSNBC and the Washington Post will co-host the fifth Democratic presidential primary debate on Nov. 20 in Georgia. As NBC News’ report on this added, “The specific location, venue, format and moderators will be announced at a later date.”

* With just a few days remaining ahead of Louisiana’s first round of balloting in the state’s gubernatorial race, the latest Emerson poll found Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) leading the field with 48% – which is awfully close to the 50% threshold he’d need to avoid a runoff and serve a second term. Eddie Rispone (R) was second in the poll with 25%, followed by Ralph Abraham (R) at 19%.

* At home in Vermont yesterday, Bernie Sanders told reporters that in the wake of his heart attack that he’ll have to “change the nature of the campaign a bit.” The independent senator suggested the shift will mean holding fewer campaign events.

* Because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is nothing if not shameless, his re-election campaign yesterday began promoting a Politico article pointing to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao’s alleged favoritism for Kentucky. Chao, of course, is McConnell’s wife. “Mitch McConnell is a Kentucky Asset,” the senator’s team wrote in a tweet highlighting the report.

* Probate judge Steven Reed (D) made history yesterday, becoming the first African-American mayor of Montgomery, Alabama.

* And Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) has thrown her endorsement to Joe Biden, looking past her fellow California senator, Kamala Harris. Feinstein had previously indicated support for Biden in January, but that was before most of the Democratic candidates had formally launched their campaigns. Biden now has five endorsements from sitting U.S. senators, more than any other Democratic candidate."

""I must confess, I was dumb,"" the 2020 presidential candidate said outside his home in Burlington, Vt. ""Thank God, I have a lot of energy during this campaign. I've been doing, in some cases, three or four rallies a day, going all over the state, Iowa, New Hampshire, wherever. And yet I, in the last month or two, just was more fatigued than I usually have been.""

""I should have listened to those symptoms,"" the 78-year-old presidential hopeful said.

BERNIE SANDERS RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL, DOCTORS SAY HE SUFFERED HEART ATTACK

Sanders revealed that he never had a doctor in his Vermont hometown, ""let alone a cardiologist,"" because his primary physician is based in Washington, D.C.

""We're going to meet him,"" Sanders said moments before getting in a car with his wife, Jane, to attend the appointment with his new physician. ""I understand he's a very good cardiologist. Going to see him on a regular basis to get some checkups, and obviously, I'll be on-and-off in Vermont and so we're going to meet him today.""

Sanders insisted he was ""feeling good,"" adding that he doesn't think the heart attack, for which he had two stents inserted into his chest to help with blood flow, ""helps or hurts"" his chances of beating President Trump in 2020.

His campaign also downplayed any skepticism that his ailments would have a negative impact on his presidential run.

""Make no mistake, Sen. Bernie Sanders is as committed — more so, even more now than he always has been, if that's even possible,"" national campaign co-chair Nina Turner told the Associated Press in an interview.

Sanders is scheduled to attend the fourth Democratic presidential debate in Ohio next week. He said Tuesday that he ""certainly intends to be actively campaigning"" but will ""change the nature"" and frequency of rallies and events to ""make sure I have the strength to do what I have to do.""

“We were doing, you know, in some cases five or six meetings a day, three or four rallies and town meetings and meeting with groups of people,” Sanders said about his campaign prior to his heart attack. “I don’t think I’m going to do that.”

Even before Sanders was rushed to the hospital after complaints of chest pains during a campaign rally in Nevada last week, the candidate faced questions about his age. The 78-year-old is the oldest candidate in the race and would be the oldest person to be elected president, should he win.

Sanders said he still plans to release his medical records, promising to do so ""at the appropriate time.""

A spokesperson for Sanders did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.

""If there's any message that I hope we can get out there, is that I want people to pay attention to their symptoms,"" Sanders said. ""When you're hurting, when you're fatigued, when you have pain in your chest, listen to it.""

Sanders received another piece of bad news on Tuesday. His daughter-in-law, 46-year-old Rainè Riggs, died at a Pennsylvania hospital two days after being diagnosed with cancer, according to an obituary posted on the Lee & Martin Funeral Home Facebook page.

Riggs was married to Sanders' son Levi and the couple has three children.

Bernie Sanders is trying to allay speculation that he would be cutting back on his campaign appearances after suffering a heart attack last week.

The 78-year-old independent senator from Vermont emphasized at the beginning of a video he sent to supporters and posted on Twitter on Thursday that “I am feeling great. I am getting my endurance back and I look forward to getting out on the campaign trail as soon as possible.”

And to hammer home the point, the populist lawmaker, who’s making his second straight White House bid, concluded the video by highlighting that “I am feeling really good. I’m getting stronger every day. We’re going to be out there on the campaign trail. We’re going to be in the debate in Columbus, Ohio next week.”

SANDERS SAID HE MISSPOKE ON SLOWING PACE OF HIS CAMPAIGN

Sanders has been off the campaign trail since being hospitalized early last week after he experienced chest pains at an event in Nevada. He’s been resting at his Vermont home since being released from the hospital on Friday.

Sanders, who's the oldest candidate in either party running in the 2020 presidential campaign, told reporters outside his home earlier this week that he would be slowing the pace of his normally frenetic campaigning.

“We were doing in some cases five or six meetings a day, three or four rallies and town meetings and meeting with groups of people,” he explained. “I don't think I'm going to do that. But I certainly intend to be actively campaigning. I think we can change the nature of the campaign a bit. Make sure that I have the strength to do what I have to do.""

Those comments made headlines, sparking speculation about Sanders’ endurance.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

In an interview Wednesday with NBC News, Sanders said: ""I misspoke the other day. I said a word I should not have said and media drives me a little bit nuts to make a big deal about it.”

""We're going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign, I love doing rallies and I love doing town meetings,” he explained before adding that ""I want to start off slower and build up and build up and build up.""

In Wednesday’s interview, Sanders also pushed back against criticism that his campaign was not transparent about the heart attack. When he was hospitalized, his campaign initially said it was because of a blockage in the senator’s artery.

""That's nonsense,"" Sanders said. ""I don't know what people think campaigns are, you know we're dealing with all kinds of doctors and we wanted to have a sense of what the hell was going on…I think we acted absolutely appropriately."""

The shocking news came as Sanders was recovering from a heart attack he suffered last week, which forced him to temporarily suspend campaign events while he recuperated.

The 46-year-old Riggs reportedly died Saturday, two days after her diagnosis and the day Sanders returned to Vermont following his release from the hospital. She was suffering from neuroendocrine cancer, which causes rare tumors to sprout up on various parts of the body.

Riggs’ obituary says she worked as a neuropsychologist and frequently volunteered with pediatric hospice. She was married to Bernie's son Levi Sanders and met him while they both worked at a food shelter in Vermont. They had three children.

The obituary also states Riggs worked as the director of behavioral medicine at Dartmouth Medical School and was the owner of Riggs Geriatric Psychology.

Sanders received an outpouring of support on Twitter from media figures and his fellow political colleagues, including Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., fellow 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang, and Meghan McCain.

Bernie Sanders' controversial statement that ""there should be no billionaires.""

BERNIE SANDERS: 'BILLIONAIRES SHOULD NOT EXIST'

""Well, Mark, that’s easy for you to say, since you are worth an estimated $70 billion dollars and since – despite the best efforts of people like Bernie Sanders – we are not yet a socialist nation and you know that money won’t be confiscated from you,"" Lahren said in her Fox Nation daily commentary, ""Final Thoughts.""

Zuckerberg was speaking during a recent livestreamed question-and-answer session with Facebook employees when he made the surprising assertion.

Asked to respond to Sanders' declaration that billionaires should not exist, Zuckerberg – the fifth richest person in the world – offered his unexpected take.

ZUCKERBERG SIDES WITH BERNIE SANDERS ON BILLIONAIRES

“I understand where he’s coming from,” Zuckerberg said. “I don’t know if I have an exact threshold on what amount of money someone should have but on some level, no one deserves to have that much money.”

Lahren went after the billionaire, slamming him for his ""hypocritical"" support of Sanders and his call to prevent Americans from attaining ""billionaire"" status.

""Looks like slamming capitalism, while benefiting from capitalism, is quite lucrative ... I’m sure it is easy for you to sit in one of your 10 properties and ponder whether you deserve it...while basking in it all,"" she said.

FACEBOOK CEO THREATENS LAWSUIT AGAINST ELIZABETH WARREN

Later in the segment, Lahren applauded Zuckerberg's plan to donate 99 percent of his Facebook shares to charity, specifically the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative – which uses technology to solve challenges like eradicating disease and reforming the criminal justice system – but noted that his decision to do so represented the very premise on which capitalism was founded on.

""That’s fantastic,"" said Lahren, ""but in a way, this only makes my point. Zuckerberg was able to achieve and attain his billions by working hard – harder than most – taking chances, building a company and a mega-brand via innovation and capitalist principles,"" she said.

""Think Facebook could have been founded in Cuba or Venezuela? Think again,"" she continued, referring to countries ruled largely by socialism.

Later in the segment, Lahren doubled down on her praise of the current capitalist structure in the U.S. and warned against redistribution of wealth.

""Zuck chooses to donate huge sums of his money the way he sees fit — not by government dictate or mandate. Would he prefer to pledge that estimated $67 billion in Facebook stock to the U.S. government? Send it to the swamp so the bureaucrats could divvy it up the way they see fit? I don’t think so,"" the Fox Nation host said.

""Whether Zuck wants to admit it or not,"" she continued, ""he knows taxation, confiscation and over-regulation kill innovation. He also believes he knows how to spend his money better than the almighty government. He lives his life like a compassionate capitalist and still feels like he must bow down to wannabe socialists like Bernie Sanders. Ridiculous,"" said Lahren.

The Fox Nation host reiterated her point, expressing support for hard work and unlimited financial potential — and urged liberals to ""butt out.""

""I am sick of these liberals telling us what we deserve and don't deserve,"" she concluded. ""This is America, we deserve what we work hard to earn ... butt out.""

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HE WAS 'MORE FATIGUED' IN MONTHS LEADING UP TO HEART ATTACK BUT IGNORED SYMPTOMS

Sanders was at a campaign rally in Nevada last Tuesday when he began complaining of chest pains.

""Somebody said, do you want to do selfies and I said, 'My God, do I not want to do selfies. Let me get the hell out of here,'"" he recalled. The discomfort prompted Sanders to visit an urgent care facility.

""They did a few tests and the doctor there said, she said, 'You're having a heart event,' and it just struck me. I could not believe it,"" Sanders said.

After Sanders was released from a Nevada hospital on Friday, the campaign disclosed that the 78-year-old had suffered a heart attack. However, Sanders pushed back on claims that his campaign tried to hide or conceal his health ailments from voters.

""No I don't accept that,"" Sanders said. ""That's nonsense and I think that sometimes, you know, I don't know what people think campaigns are. We're dealing with all kinds of doctors and we wanted to have a sense of what the hell was going on really. So the first thing that we're trying to do is understand what's going on and not run to The New York Times and not have to report every 15 minutes. This is not a baseball game. So I think we acted absolutely appropriately.""

""No apologies,"" he added.

Watters claimed Warren would have to be chosen as her running mate in order for the former secretary of state to have a shot at the party nomination.

He said Clinton could convince Democratic voters by reminding them she beat Trump in the popular vote and in other categories other than the actual elector tally.

""I outraised him, I out-debated him, I could beat him again if I just go to Wisconsin,"" Watters said, imitating what Clinton would say.

Watters said Sanders would have to be guaranteed a cabinet nomination, in order for Clinton to gain the support of the Vermont senator's energized base.

Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, is threatening to boycott next week’s Democratic presidential debate amid accusations that the Democratic National Committee and the media are “rigging” the 2020 primary elections against dark horse candidates like herself.

Gabbard, who reached the qualification thresholds for next Tuesday’s debate in Ohio, called the qualifications “arbitrary” and said DNC leaders “are trying to hijack the entire election process.” She said she will decide in the next few days whether she will participate in the debate.

“The DNC and corporate media are trying to hijack the entire election process,” Gabbard said in a video posted on Twitter. “In order to bring attention to this serious threat to our democracy, and ensure your voice is heard, I am giving serious consideration to boycotting the next debate on October 15th.”

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Gabbard’s complaint about the DNC “rigging” the primary election dredges up similar objections from 2016 when the DNC was accused of favoring former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

“The 2016 Democratic Primary election was rigged by the DNC and their partners in the corporate media against Bernie Sanders,” Gabbard said. “In this 2020 election, the DNC and corporate media are rigging the election again, but this time against the American people in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada.”

Gabbard’s move to possibly boycott the debate is a double-edged sword for the candidate, as she would miss the opportunity to reach millions of voters tuning into the debate, while the boycott would draw a great deal of attention to her campaign. The Hawaii Democrat did not qualify for September’s DNC debate in Houston, but has met the criteria of 130,000 unique donors and hitting at least 2 percent in four approval polls to qualify for Tuesday’s debate.

Twelve candidates have qualified for Tuesday’s debate – leaving four who are still in the race on the sidelines.

“They are attempting to replace the roles of voters in the early states, using polling and other arbitrary methods which are not transparent or democratic, and holding so-called debates which are not debates at all but rather commercialized reality television meant to entertain, not inform or enlighten,” Gabbard said. “In short, the DNC and corporate media are trying to hijack the entire election process.”

To qualify for November’s debate, a candidate must reach 165,000 unique donors and reach 3 percent in four approved polls. So far only eight candidates have hit that mark, with Gabbard not being among them."

Councilman Adam Roof, who wrote the resolution which passed in a 10-2 vote, argued all residents of the city are impacted by decisions made at City Hall, and therefore should be allowed to vote regardless of citizenship status.

“The right to vote is more important now than ever before,"" Roof told WCAX-TV. ""All residents have the right, in my eyes, to participate in the local democratic process, and the highest level of participation in that process is being able to cast your vote,""

He said the resolution aligns with the city's 2014 Diversity and Equity Strategic Plan to create a more engaged community. More than 3,000 residents are ineligible to vote due to their status as refugees, the resolution said.

One resident spoke out against the measure, accusing the council of ""political pandering"" to voters.

""We have 40,000-plus registered voters,"" the unidentified resident said. ""How many of those are nonresident college students who vote on our property taxes, our legislators, our city leadership -- which includes all of you -- and much more, and then move away?""

Burlington, the hometown of Democratic socialist presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, has a population of approximately 42,000 people. It is also home to the University of Vermont, which has more than 10,000 undergraduate students.

Council President Kurt Wright said he voted against the legislation because he believes only American citizens should be able to vote.

“I think that’s important. I would not expect to move to another country and not become a citizen and expect to be voting in their elections,” said Wright, a Republican. “We voted on this just a few years ago and the citizens of Burlington voted significantly against it so I’m not supportive of this proposal.”

""To me, this is shaping up as a three-way race"" with Bernie Sanders among the Democrats, co-host Juan Williams said.

The new national poll showed Warren, a Massachusetts senator, holding a slight edge – but within the margin of error – over the former vice president in the race for their party’s 2020 nomination.

The poll, released Tuesday by Quinnipiac University, was the latest in a slew of national and early voting state surveys in recent weeks showing Warren has surged to a virtual tie with Biden in the primary battle.

Williams also addressed a report that donors were unhappy with Biden's campaign.

""It seems to me Biden may not be doing so great. By the way, all these donors, they're nervous Nellies all the time,"" Williams said. ""They're always nervous and they want Biden to be more combative. From your perspective, they want him to really go after Trump in a vicious way, and Biden is just not their guy right now.

Co-host Jedediah Bila criticized Biden's approach to his 2020 presidential run.

""He looks like a guy who's already lost. He's very defensive. He's on defense all the time. He's worried about his son's business dealings. He's worried about Elizabeth Warren,"" Bila said. ""The problem is that all the worries show in every interaction he has. When he gets on a debate stage, he doesn't look competent. He doesn't look like he's in control.""

Bila added, ""He's so unable to really prioritize what his stand on the issues is, because he's so worried about all these things."""

'WOLF OF WALL STREET' FILM COMPANY TO PAY $60M SETTLEMENT

Belfort’s early life and crimes were portrayed in the blockbuster Hollywood movie, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, “The Wolf of Wall Street.” Belfort served 22 months in prison between 2004 and 2006 for securities fraud totaling over $200 million. He was also ordered to give back $110 million to investors.

The film was based on a book written by Belfort. He said that becoming sober and writing the book were pivotal experiences on his road to rehabilitation.

“When I wrote the book it was like… self-therapy to look back and examine all your actions… I love the movie—obviously, some things were fictionalized to serve the narrative so to speak… There are some things that bothered me that I thought made me look worse than I was and other things that probably didn't look as bad as I was,” said Belfort on Fox Nation's ""No Interruption.""

The 2013 film reportedly made about $400 million worldwide and contributed to kicking off Belfort’s second career as a motivation speaker.

“In terms of what you did and what brought the charges and what brought the guilty plea -- do you have remorse for that?” asked Lahren.

“Of course, I'm remorseful about what happened,” answered Belfort.

“Do you think jail rehabilitated you in a way? Gave you a chance to reflect?” Lahren pressed.

“I deserved to go to jail… I definitely deserved to go to jail, it was definitely a positive experience,” said Belfort. “I thought the judge was very smart… he sentenced me to a long enough time to really like… I'll never forget—that was terrible. Yet not long enough to destroy my life, destroy my children.”

Later in the interview, Lahren asked Belfort to weigh in on the current 2020 Democratic field, as leading candidates like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren call for a crackdown on Wall Street and financial institutions.

“Wall Street has a really, really important function, right? When Wall Street runs amuck, it gets really ugly. What frightens me about a Bernie Sanders or an Elizabeth Warren is like they think that government is… the answer… The policies that they're talking about will literally destroy the fabric of the country,” Belfort said.

However, Belfort said that he’s confident that Trump will win in 2020.

“If I didn't, I wouldn't be able to sleep at night, OK? Because I think that this nation would be literally destroyed. If one of these people gets into office—a Warren or Sanders—destruction.”

Lastly, Lahren asked Belfort if he identified with Trump.

“He's a great salesman… I wish that he would say things in a way that p*** people off less because it doesn't help… but I can’t judge because he's president. I didn't become president, he did. I went to jail.”

Biden stays on top in the race with 32 percent support among primary voters, up 3 points since September. He’s followed by Elizabeth Warren at 22 percent -- that’s up 6 points and a new high for her. Bernie Sanders is at 17 percent, down 1 point since last month.

While Biden’s support has stayed between 29-35 percent since March, his current 10-point advantage is about half of his 19-point lead in June.

The rundown continues with Kamala Harris at 5 percent, Pete Buttigieg at 4 percent, Beto O’Rourke at 3 percent, and Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang each at 2 percent. Michael Bennet, Julian Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Tim Ryan, Tom Steyer, and Marianne Williamson receive 1 percent apiece.

Biden retains top billing with strong support among non-whites, voters over age 45, and moderates/conservatives. Warren has strengthened her position by increasing support among suburban voters, very liberals, and men.

When Democratic primary voters’ first and second choice preferences are considered together, Biden and Warren tie at 45 percent support, Sanders is at 34 percent, Harris 15 percent and Buttigieg 13 percent.

President Trump’s allegations about improper actions by Biden and his son have so far failed to chip away at Biden’s support in the primary race -- and Democratic primary voters continue to believe the former vice president is the candidate best equipped to beat Trump in 2020: 43 percent feel that way, up from 42 percent last month. Nineteen percent think Warren has the best chance to oust Trump and 15 percent say Sanders.

At the same time, the poll finds the three top Democratic candidates with sizable leads over the president in potential head-to-head matchups.

The poll, released Thursday, shows Biden (50-40 percent) and Warren (50-40 percent) both top Trump by 10 points, and Sanders is up by 9 (49-40 percent). This marks the first time all three Democrats have held a lead outside the poll’s margin of error. Last month, Biden was up by 14 points, Warren by 6 and Sanders by 8.

“If Warren continues to poll as strongly against Trump as the former vice president, it makes it increasingly difficult for the Biden team to keep making the argument he is the most electable candidate,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican Daron Shaw.

The impeachment inquiry hasn’t caused any real shifts in the ballot test, as Trump’s support in the two-way matchups has been between 37-42 percent all year. However, the poll finds an 8-point shift since last month in the number expecting Trump will be re-elected. In September, more thought he would win by a 6-point margin and now more expect he won’t by 2 points.

And while most Republican primary voters want to keep Trump as their party’s nominee, nearly one in five, 17 percent, would like to see someone else run.

“So far, Trump has been able to keep his Republican base on board,” says Shaw. “If the percentage opposing his re-nomination creeps into the 20s, that would be a troubling sign.”

Meanwhile, voters continue to believe Donald Trump is dishonest. Sixty-three percent say that -- far more than the 35 percent who think he is honest and trustworthy. By the way, that’s the same number who said Trump was honest before he won the 2016 election.

Vice President Mike Pence does a bit better than his boss, although not by much: 39 percent say he’s honest and 54 percent say dishonest.

On the other side, each of the top three Democratic candidates receives positive ratings on this measure. Sanders performs best with 59 percent saying he is honest and trustworthy (36 percent disagree). Fifty percent think Warren is honest vs. 44 percent dishonest, and for Biden voters split 48-47 percent.

Among Democrats, 87 percent think Sanders is honest and trustworthy, while 81 percent feel that way about Warren and 75 percent Biden. Seventy-three percent of Republicans say Trump is honest.

Currently, 51 percent of voters have a favorable opinion of Sanders, while 43 percent view him negatively. That puts him in positive territory by 8 points. More view Warren positively by 7 points (46 favorable vs. 39 unfavorable) and Biden by 6 (50 favorable vs. 44 unfavorable).

The ratings are closer to even for Buttigieg (+3 points), Yang (+3), Booker (-2), Harris (-3) and O’Rourke (-4). They each also have large numbers who have never heard of them or have no opinion of them. For example, 43 percent of voters are unable to rate Yang, while 36 percent can’t rate Buttigieg and 32 percent can’t rate Booker.

Voters view Trump more negatively than positively by 13 points (43-56). His personal favorable rating was underwater by 22 points in the days leading up to the 2016 election (38-60).

Twice as many primary voters say Trump’s allegations make them more likely to vote for Biden (21 percent more vs. 10 percent less), while twice as many say health concerns make them less (31 percent) rather than more likely (15 percent) to vote for Sanders in the primary.

Sanders is off the campaign trail since suffering a heart attack October 3. He’s 78 years old, while Biden is 76, Trump is 73, and Warren is 70.

Conducted October 6-8, 2019 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,003 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said she is committed to forgoing big-money fundraisers if she wins the Democratic nomination, no matter how much money President Trump pulls in from his supporters.

""I’m not going to go do the big-dollar fund-raisers. I’m just not going to do it,” Warren told CBS in an interview posted Tuesday. The 2020 hopeful said that her campaign was predicated on the notion ""that we can build this together. And that’s exactly what we’re doing.”

CBS reporter Zak Hudak had asked Warren whether she could guarantee her supporters she wouldn't utilize big-dollar fundraisers.

Warren claimed that without financial independence, candidates would continue serving wealthy interests after they were elected to office.

DEMS PUBLICLY TOUT SMALL DOLLAR DONATIONS WHILE QUIETLY COURTING BIG DOLLAR DONORS

""I will not be forced to make changes in how I raise money,” Warren said. “Look, for me, this is pretty straightforward. Either you think democracy works and electing a president is all about going behind closed doors with bazillionaires and corporate executives and lobbyists and scooping up as much money as possible.

""Or you think it’s about a grass-roots, let’s build this from the ground up.”

That answer appeared to represent a reversal for Warren after she expressed openness to big-dollar donors in a general election. Not doing so, she indicated, was ""unilateral disarmament.""

""We’ll be up against a Republican machine that will be hell-bent on keeping the White House,"" she told MSNBC in February. ""They will have PACs and Super PACs and too many special interest groups to count, and we will do what is necessary to match them financially. That means investing -- starting now -- in each and every one of our state parties, and in our national party too.”

It's unclear what was behind Warren's apparent reversal but her comments came just days after her campaign announced it had raised $24.6 million from more than half a million individual donors in the third quarter of this year. That was substantially higher than the $15.2 million raised by former Vice President Joe Biden but slightly lower than the $25.3 million raised by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

If Warren wins the Democratic nomination, she would likely face an incumbent candidate backed by a Republican Party that has recorded record-breaking fundraising numbers.

In the third quarter alone, the Republican National Committee and President Trump's campaign raised $125 million. Within just 24 hours in September, those two entities raked in an eye-popping $5 million -- an apparent backlash to the formal impeachment inquiry announced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. So far in 2019, those two organizations have raised $308 million.

TIME FOR A RE-PETE?

What’s so great about fourth place?



If you’re South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, quite a lot actually.



Readers have no doubt been watching Elizabeth Warren’s steady gains against front-runner Joe Biden in recent weeks. She is now just 2.4 points behind Biden in our Democratic 2020 Power Ranking. As Biden continues to struggle with the enhanced scrutiny on his family’s buck raking facilitated by Biden’s proximity to power, we expect his troubles to continue.



While Democrats are loath to publically agree with President Trump, the facts of the case of Trump’s likely impeachment reinforce Biden’s strongest negatives: That he has been around too long and is too much of a swamp creature.



We know Biden supporters are preparing to spend millions to prop up the former Delaware senator in his third presidential quest, but it is hard to imagine that Biden could persist for long in second place.



When electability is your cri de coeur it’s hard to keep voters around when you don’t look so electable.



This is good news for Warren, no doubt. But she had better be worried that it is good news come too soon. As Biden is currently experiencing, being the frontrunner is not all aviator sunglasses and waffle cones.



Warren has long enjoyed kid-glove treatment from the press, with relatively little scrutiny on her very ambitious policy proposals. She has also gotten a couple of mulligans on biographical boo-boos. That won’t last if she gets out in front. The steady diet of opposition research that will fill reporters’ inboxes will see to that.



So cast your eyes down the list. You can skip over poor Bernie Sanders who is struggling not just with his own health issues, but with the tragic loss of his daughter-in-law. The Vermont senator has said he will scale back his campaigning, and is already 10 points behind Warren and falling.



Buttigieg, though, has been climbing. Perhaps the beneficiary of the unraveling of California Sen. Kamala Harris’ misbegotten campaign or perhaps some Biden skeptics defecting, Buttigieg is a man on the move.



Certainly Sens. Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar are hoping that they would see their boats lifted by the melting of Biden’s iceberg, but Buttigieg may have the best case to make.



His fundraising haul in the third quarter says that he will have the resources to go the distance and his moderate-sounding appeal to voters would position him nicely to pick up the business-friendly Democratic donors who are terrified of either a Warren defeat or victory.



Whether Buttigieg can capitalize on the opportunity will depend on his ability to go toe-to-toe with Warren. In the first Buttigieg craze, he wasn’t able to translate interest into hard support. In a second go-around he’d have to play for keeps.



SANDERS TO SCALE BACK CAMPAIGN AFTER HEART SURGERY

WaPo: “[Bernie Sanders] visited a cardiologist Tuesday morning, and when he returned, he told reporters, ‘We’re gonna change the nature of the campaign a bit.’ ‘Probably not doing four rallies a day,’ said Sanders, who had adopted a more furious campaign schedule than many of his much younger opponents. Sanders, who has committed to releasing his medical records before the first primary votes but has not yet done so, said Tuesday he would provide the information at ‘the appropriate time.’ Former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — fellow septuagenarians who join Sanders at the top of most polls — have also committed to releasing their medical records.”



Daughter-in-law, 46, killed by rare cancer - USA Today: “The daughter-in-law of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has died, shortly after being diagnosed with cancer. Rainè Riggs was 46. The Lee & Martin Funeral Home in Burgettstown, Pennsylvania, says Riggs died Saturday, the day Sanders returned to Vermont after suffering a heart attack. Her obituary said she was diagnosed with neuroendocrine cancer. Riggs, a neuropsychologist, was married to Levi Sanders, who ran unsuccessfully for a New Hampshire congressional seat in 2018. Riggs' obituary says she met Levi Sanders while the two worked at an emergency food shelter in Vermont. The obituary said Riggs was the director of behavioral medicine at Dartmouth Medical School for several years, and she started the Palliative Care Department for Dartmouth Medical Center. She also owned Riggs Geriatric Psychology in Windsor, Vermont. Riggs and Sanders had three children.”



Dianne Feinstein endorses Biden, snubs Harris - Fox News: “Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., announced Tuesday she is endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary -- choosing her former longtime Senate colleague over Kamala Harris, her fellow California Democratic senator. Feinstein’s endorsement, the first major Democratic endorsement by a top legislator this campaign season, comes as Biden has been losing ground in the polls in the wake of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump and a series of high-profile gaffes while on the stump. But the longtime California senator praised the former vice president for his long tenure in Washington and his work on gun control. ‘I’ve worked closely with Vice President Biden and I’ve seen firsthand his legislative ability, his statesmanship, and most importantly his moral fortitude,’ Feinstein said in a statement.”



THE RULEBOOK: SUFFICIENT RESOURCES

“I believe it may be regarded as a position warranted by the history of mankind, that, IN THE USUAL PROGRESS OF THINGS, THE NECESSITIES OF A NATION, IN EVERY STAGE OF ITS EXISTENCE, WILL BE FOUND AT LEAST EQUAL TO ITS RESOURCES.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 30



TIME OUT: ‘YESTERDAY’ CAME SUDDENLY

On this day in 1965, The Beatles’ “Yesterday” began its month-long reign as the top single in the U.S. The song, Paul McCartney’s masterwork, started as a dream. The Telegraph [U.K.]: “As McCartney explained in 1980: ‘I woke up with a lovely tune in my head. I thought, 'That’s great, I wonder what that is?' There was an upright piano next to me, to the right of the bed by the window. I got out of bed, sat at the piano, found G, found F sharp minor 7th – and that leads you through then to B to E minor, and finally back to E. It all leads forward logically. I liked the melody a lot but because I’d dreamed it I couldn’t believe I’d written it. I thought, ‘No, I’ve never written like this before.’ But I had the tune, which was the most magic thing.’ McCartney was living in Wimpole Street, London, at the time, at the family home of Jane Asher, who he was dating at the time.”

TRUMP’S IMPEACHMENT PLAN: BURN DOWN THE HOUSE

Axios: “President Trump, while nervous about the historic stain of impeachment, is throwing everything he has into this fight: refusing all cooperation, running ads to profit politically, and torching every person who stands in opposition to him. When it all boils down, Trump really only trusts his own instincts. And his instincts here are the same as they were with the Mueller investigation: Fight like hell. No nuance or apology — not a hint of it. Turn the leader of the investigation (in this case, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff) into a conservative media villain. Condemn Trump enemies in the most incendiary and exaggerated language possible (treason, traitors, coup, etc.). Compared to the Mueller investigation, the Ukraine phone call appears to have more resonance with the general public. Republicans close to leadership and the White House tell Axios they're concerned by trend lines in a Washington Post poll showing 49% of Americans think Trump should be removed from office.”



Partisan lines holding - NBC News: “A majority of Americans say the allegations that President Donald Trump asked a foreign leader to investigate 2020 rival Joe Biden are serious and need to be fully investigated, and they also believe the president hasn’t been honest and truthful about his actions. Still, the public is divided – largely along partisan lines – on whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office, with 43 percent supporting his removal given what they know today, versus 49 percent who oppose it. … According to the poll, 47 percent of Americans believe the allegations that Trump requested Ukraine’s president to look into the Bidens are either ‘quite serious’ or ‘extremely serious.’ That includes 73 percent of Democrats, 55 percent of independents and even 21 percent of Republicans. By contrast, a combined 28 percent dismiss the allegations as either being not serious or false and without merit. Twenty-five percent of respondents say they don’t have an opinion or are unsure.”



Q Poll: Support for impeachment inquiry steady - Quinnipiac University: “After another week with impeachment in the news, registered voters nationwide are still divided on impeaching and removing President Trump from office, with 45 percent saying he should be impeached and removed and 49 percent opposing the idea, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. This compares to last week's poll, in which voters were evenly split on impeaching and removing the president 47 - 47 percent. In a poll released on September 25, before any major news about impeachment, voters were clearly against impeachment 37 - 57 percent. While nearly half of voters do not currently back impeachment, a majority of voters do still approve 53 - 43 percent of the impeachment inquiry being conducted by the U.S. House of Representatives in order to determine whether or not to bring impeachment charges against the president. A week ago, voters approved of the inquiry 52 - 45 percent.”



Gowdy joins Team Trump - Bloomberg: “Donald Trump has enlisted former Representative Trey Gowdy to work with the White House team combating the U.S. House’s impeachment inquiry into the president, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Gowdy, a former prosecutor from South Carolina, is not formally joining the White House staff, according to the people. He was at the White House on Tuesday, according to one person who saw him there, before an eight-page letter was issued to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declaring that Trump and the administration wouldn’t participate in the impeachment inquiry.”



What will become of Mick Mulvaney? - The Atlantic: “[Mick] Mulvaney’s uncertain status says something about Trump’s mind-set. In the face of this latest peril, and nearly 1,000 days into his tenure, he still hasn’t settled on how the West Wing should run. Confronting the impeachment threat is a West Wing staff that Trump has largely neutered. Aides have been left guessing about who’s coming and going, much less what they’re supposed to say about accusations that Trump pressured Ukraine to ferret out dirt on his potential 2020 rival Joe Biden. In the two weeks since the whistle-blower complaint was released to the public, the White House still hasn’t articulated a clear legal, political, or communications strategy needed to withstand impeachment and keep Trump’s Republican support from eroding.”



Watergate lessons for GOP - FiveThirtyEight: “One complicating factor here is that if Republicans were to abandon Trump, history does not suggest that Trump loyalists would easily forgive them for joining the Democrats’ impeachment effort. Even though most Americans did eventually support removing [Richard] Nixon from office, Republican voters were mostly not part of that consensus. Days before he resigned, a Gallup poll found that only 31 percent of Republicans thought Nixon should no longer be president. And some of those supporters deeply resented their representatives for their role in ousting Nixon, which may even have contributed to the Democratic landslide in the 1974 midterm elections.”



SENATE GOP CAMPAIGN ARM RAISES RECORD CASH

WashEx: “The committee tasked with electing Republican senators amid the impeachment battle will report raising $47.7 million so far this year, an amount that is already greater than ever raised before in the year prior to an election year. The National Republican Senatorial Committee is crucial to protecting vulnerable incumbents like Susan Collins of Maine, Cory Gardner of Colorado, and Martha McSally of Arizona. In the three-month period ending Sept. 30, the NRSC raised roughly $13.1 million, including approximately $5 million in September — and made the last payment on a $17 million debt left over from the midterm elections. The NRSC shared these figures with the Washington Examiner on Tuesday, ahead of its upcoming Federal Election Commission filing. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is trying maintain Republican control of the Senate. Currently there are 53 GOP senators in the conference.”



Planned Parenthood preps massive 2020 spending - Fox News: “Planned Parenthood, the behemoth nonprofit organization that provides reproductive health care and is the nation’s largest abortion provider, says it’s making a major investment in the 2020 elections. Planned Parenthood’s political wings – which fight for legal protections for abortion – announced Wednesday that they’ll spend $45 million backing candidates who support abortion rights in elections next year ranging from the state house level to the White House. … The group says its top priority in 2020 is to defeat and unseat President Trump. Other priorities include helping Democrats retake control of the GOP-controlled Senate and holding the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. The group will target roughly 5 million voters across the country, with the spotlight on nine key swing states: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.”



Bevin looks to impeachment backlash to hold on in Kentucky - RCP: “[Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin] has pressed the pending impeachment of President Trump into his own Kentucky reelection effort. Standing outside the governor’s mansion on Friday, Bevin tied his fate to Trump’s by condemning impeachment as ‘an absolute travesty’ and calling on his Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Andy Beshear, to answer a ‘fundamental question’: Will Beshear support or oppose forcing the president from office? The Democrat doesn’t want to answer, and the ensuing drama in a 2019 race could draw a rough sketch of the electoral implications of impeachment in 2020.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I appreciate Ellen DeGeneres’ statement about her friendship with former President George W. Bush. How have we reached this point where we can’t be friends with, or at least be civil to, those who hold a different viewpoint? … The father of Christian Rock, Larry Norman, once told a joke about witnessing to people and the ‘religious’ terminology that is often used. In the story, the Christian becomes frustrated at the end of a conversation he’s been having with a friend because the friend doesn’t understand the terms justification, sanctification, or being saved. In frustration he shouts, ‘I’m trying to tell you the Good News!’ His friend asks, ‘What’s that?’ The Christian responds, ‘You’re going to Hell!’ To which his friend replies, ‘Well, what’s the bad news?’ The point of recounting that is to state that if we hold firm convictions, that’s fine, but we need to convey them in a loving and respectful way. Our actions speak louder than our words. If we’re not mindful of that, we risk offending the person, or worse, losing the opportunity for dialogue that we seek with the other person. I believe that in matters of faith especially, that would be a bad thing. As always, I wish you and your family God’s richest blessings!” – Paul Schnier, Shoreham, N.Y.



[Ed. note: Amen, Mr. Schnier! That goes for politics, too. Persuasion leads to consensus, which leads to durable reforms. Division leads to government by plurality, which leads to lurching. Blessings to you and yours, too.]



“I fully understand your point today about the legal (‘shoot someone on 5th Ave’) and political differences (‘posting TS documents on IG’) when viewing Congress' vested powers to impeach a sitting President. Hopefully this third time is a charm. What about this [Contributions and donations by foreign nationals.] I believe this is what your colleague Judge [Andrew Napolitano] has been referencing in his argument on recent articles and TV shows. … The difference between this and the Mueller/Russia case was that this bordered on bribery in ‘bribes, high crimes and misdemeanors.’ Mueller's case was weak and bordered on emotion. This is a stronger case with a self-admitted crime, No? An independent voter's perspective.” – Jai Suresh, Fremont, Calif.



[Ed. note: I hear you, Mr. Suresh. But, no matter which side you take here, the question of impeachment still isn’t about the law. The question is political, or at best, moral. It is what the members of the House (and the constituents they represent) say it is. Efforts to find specific criminal charges miss the point of the endeavor.]

EAU DE BIG BOY

AP: “An Ohio homeowner never envisioned becoming semi-famous because of a goat butting its way into her home and taking a nap in her bathroom. … The break-in happened Friday when an escaped male goat from a farm several miles away repeatedly butted against a sliding glass door... [Jennifer Keathley’s] 18-year-old son, Logan, discovered the billy goat in the bathroom when he returned home Friday afternoon from school to find the family’s agitated German Shepherd in the driveway, broken glass on the back porch and the house reeking. … Two Ashland County Sheriff’s deputies unsuccessfully tried to coax the goat, named Big Boy, out of the home with carrots, a dog bone and grass. They eventually grabbed him by the horns and dragged him outside… The Keathleys learned their home insurance policy covers damage from bears and deer but not goats. … Despite applications of carpet deodorant and urine neutralizer, she said the odor from Big Boy’s urine still lingers.”

Sanders said Wednesday on ""The Story"" that as a Delaware senator, former Vice President Joe Biden urged congressional restraint in two past impeachment inquiries and had done so with Trump until recently.

""It's a fair question -- why today and why now?"" Sanders opened by saying, in reference to Biden telling a New Hampshire crowd earlier Wednesday he now backs impeaching Trump.

""I think the acts of the last 15 days are what moved Vice President Biden to this position. Fifteen days ago, Vice President Biden was in Wilmington, Delaware, and he gave a statement.

""He said if Donald Trump and the Trump administration did not cooperate with Congress' investigation that they constitutionally have the right to do, then this would be a tragedy of Donald Trump's own making.""

BIDEN, FOR FIRST TIME, CALLS FOR TRUMP TO BE IMPEACHED

The president has since indicated the administration will not cooperate with the House's ongoing impeachment inquiry, claiming it is illegitimate.

Sanders said that when Biden was in the U.S. Senate, he served during impeachment inquiries into ex-Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. Nixon resigned before he could be impeached, while Clinton was impeached by the House but a Senate vote did not garner enough support to remove him from office.

""There is a process and a system,"" she said.

""It has been a remarkable time in American politics and political history,"" Sanders added.

Sanders continued, saying a whistleblower complaint and accompanying Trump phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed an open invitation to a foreign government to interfere in U.S. elections.

Sanders rejected a question from host Martha MacCallum as to whether Biden's slippage in Democratic primary polls against Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., spurred him to support impeachment."

Appearing on ""America's Newsroom"" with host Sandra Smith, Sanders, now a Fox News contributor, said that this is a very difficult situation for the president.

""You have Turkey, who is a NATO ally. You have the Kurds, who have been an ally in the fight against ISIS. Unfortunately, those two allies hate each other and the president wants to be careful that we don't get stuck in the middle of another endless war,"" said Sanders.

""This is a sad tragedy of the Middle East. It's a never-ending tale of the conflict that exists there,"" she told Smith.

The ongoing military assault in Syria has left more than 100 Kurdish forces dead, Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan claimed Thursday morning. Turkey has long-threatened to attack the Kurdish fighters whom Ankara considers terrorists allied with a Kurdish insurgency in Turkey.

The Turkish leader is also warning the European Union Thursday not to call Ankara's incursion into Syria an ""invasion,"" and renewed his threat of ""opening the gates"" and letting Syrian refugees flood into Europe.

In a statement released by the White House, the president said, ""The United States does not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea. Turkey has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place—and we will hold them to this commitment.""

He also later told reporters that he would employ ""far more than sanctions"" against Turkey if the country fails to act in the most ""humane way"" possible and that he hoped Erdogan would act rationally.

When asked what would happen if Erdogan wiped out the Kurds, Trump threatened to ""wipe out"" Turkey's economy, saying he'd done it once before.

A standout moment of the June 27 Democratic primary debate was that of all the candidates on the stage raising their hands, signifying support for government health care plans including “undocumented” immigrants.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SHOULD GET HEALTH CARE, SAY DEMS IN NIGHT 2 DEBATE

Republicans and the White House have seized on that moment, with President Trump declaring it “the end of the race.”

But with the campaign definitely not over, and a number of frontrunners now backing the policy, more attention is turning to how much it could cost to give millions of illegal immigrants health insurance. On Thursday, the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), a policy group that advocates for lower levels of immigration overall, published a study finding that the cost could be up to $23 billion a year.

While candidates have not necessarily gone into detail about their plans, CIS cites an Atlantic survey that found that Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; and former Housing Secretary Julian Castro would all provide “full benefits” to those in the country illegally.

The CIS study estimated that 4.9 million illegal immigrants have incomes below 400 percent of the poverty line and also do not have insurance -- meaning they have incomes low enough to receive coverage via either Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act -- also known to many, particularly critics, as ObamaCare.

The study estimates that if all income-eligible, uninsured illegal immigrants received subsidies under the ACA, then the cost to insure would be $22.6 billion, but with “likely enrollment” of 46 percent, the total cost would be perhaps $10.4 billion a year. It predicts that the average cost of a subsidized premium would be $4,637.

If a mixed approach of ACA subsidies and Medicaid enrollment were used, the cost would dip to $19.6 billion with 100 percent enrollment, and $10.7 billion assuming “likely enrollment.”

These numbers could change significantly if a more overarching health care overhaul is passed by a future Democratic White House and Congress.

“Numbers aside, the fact that presidential candidates are advocating spending billions of dollars on people who are in the country illegally is significant in its own right,” the report concludes. “It suggests that allowing in large numbers of less-educated workers will inevitably generate significant political pressure to provide them access to social programs.”

Extending health care to illegal immigrants could, however, be only one part of the cost to taxpayers of more generous social policies being pushed by Democrats.

AOC PUSHES NATIONAL RENT CONTROL, WELFARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN LATEST MASSIVE PROPOSAL

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who was an early champion of left-favored policies now finding their way into 2020 Democratic platforms, recently introduced a new package of policies known as the “Just Society.”

Among those bills is “The Embrace Act,” which would allow illegal immigrants to claim the same welfare benefits as U.S. citizens and those in the country legally.

CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM

""Notwithstanding any other provision of law ... an individual who is an alien (without regard to the immigration status of that alien) may not be denied any federal public benefit solely on the basis of the individual’s immigration status,” the bill reads.

The bill defines a federal public benefit as: “any grant, contract, loan, professional license or commercial license provided by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States; and ... any retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, post-secondary education, food assistance, unemployment benefit,or any other similar benefit for which payments or assistance are provided to an individual, household, or family eligibility unit by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States.”"

GIULIANI ASSOCIATES NABBED FOR ALLEGED CAMPAIGN CRIMES

WSJ: “Two Soviet-born donors to a pro-Trump fundraising committee who helped Rudy Giuliani’s efforts to investigate Democrat Joe Biden were arrested late Wednesday on criminal charges of violating campaign finance rules, including funneling Russian money into President Trump’s campaign. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two Florida businessmen, have been under investigation by the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan, and are expected to appear in federal court in Virginia later on Thursday, the people said. Both men were born in former Soviet republics. Mr. Giuliani, President Trump’s private lawyer, identified the two men in May as his clients. Both men have donated to Republican campaigns including Mr. Trump’s, and in May 2018 gave $325,000 to the primary pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action… A Justice Department official said [Attorney General William Barr] was supportive of their work on the case, on which he was first briefed shortly after being confirmed as attorney general in February.”



Fox poll: Record support for Trump’s ouster - Fox News: “Just over half of voters want President Trump impeached and removed from office, according to a Fox News Poll released Wednesday. A new high of 51 percent wants Trump impeached and removed from office, another 4 percent want him impeached but not removed, and 40 percent oppose impeachment altogether. In July, 42 percent favored impeachment and removal, while 5 percent said impeach but don’t remove him, and 45 percent opposed impeachment.Since July, support for impeachment increased among voters of all stripes: up 11 points among Democrats, 5 points among Republicans and 3 among independents. Support also went up among some of Trump’s key constituencies, including white evangelical Christians (+5 points), white men without a college degree (+8), and rural whites (+10). Among voters in swing counties (where Hillary Clinton and Trump were within 10 points in 2016), support for impeachment increased to 52 percent, up from 42 percent in July.”



Pence to release transcripts of his Ukraine calls - AP: “Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday he is working with the White House counsel’s office to release transcripts of his own calls with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Pence said records of his two phone conversations would help exonerate President Donald Trump of any wrongdoing. Pence was asked about releasing his transcripts and told reporters, ‘I’d have no objection to that.’ He spoke after an event in Waukee, Iowa, where he addressed supporters about the president’s trade policy. Pence said he ‘never discussed the issue of the Bidens’ with Zelenskiy. And he again defended the president, insisting that a ‘plain reading’ of the rough transcript of Trump’s call with the Ukranian leader shows ‘there was no quid pro quo.’”



Pergram: Trump team’s stonewalling speeds up Democrats’ timetable - Fox News: “Next Tuesday is the deadline for most of the House’s requests. That coincides with the day the House returns to session. [Nancy] Pelosi will take the temperature of her caucus when lawmakers return. But in some respects, Pelosi already knows the temperature. Democrats are seething over the administration failing to meet congressional demands. They think they have a robust case against the president when it comes to obstruction of Congress. Pelosi could grant the administration more time to comply. That would let the issue marinate in public for a bit – and demonstrate that Democrats aren’t hasty to impeach. But after that, the House Judiciary Committee could begin drafting articles of impeachment. Pelosi doesn’t travel roads like this unless she already knows the outcome. She doesn’t lose votes on the floor – especially something of this magnitude.”



Trump’s Syria decision affects GOP backing on impeachment - WaPo: “President Trump’s decision to suddenly withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria has angered evangelical Christian leaders and Republican hawks, cleaving his political coalition at the very moment he is trying to fortify his standing to survive the intensifying impeachment inquiry in Congress. Instead of enjoying uncontested GOP support as he plunges into a constitutional showdown with House Democrats and prepares for a bruising reelection campaign, Trump is now fighting on two fronts within his party. … The past few days have tested the bounds of Trump’s Republican support at an unusually frenzied political crossroads that has brought uncertainty for elected officials. While GOP lawmakers have been skittish about directly engaging the subject at the heart of the impeachment debate — the president’s conduct with his Ukrainian counterpart — many have felt free to loudly condemn Trump’s Syria decision, underscoring the fluidity within GOP ranks.”



The Judge’s Ruling: With Syria, Trump lives up to his campaign promise - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains that President Trump removing U.S. troops from Syria complies with his duty to uphold the Constitution: “Trump ran for office promising to bring the troops home. He may have made the latest decision to do so without adequate warning to his military commanders, but his decision is utterly consistent with his promises, and it is utterly in compliance with the Constitution. Now is the time for Congress -- which is largely angry at the presidential use or nonuse of the military -- to repeal both AUMFs and the War Powers Resolution and reclaim its constitutional power as the sole entity in the federal government able to declare war. Until it does, these profoundly outdated, morally ambivalent and overtly unconstitutional statutes lie in the presidential desk drawer like a loaded gun.” More here.



THE RULEBOOK: CUE ‘I’M JUST A BILL’

“The President of the United States is to have power to return a bill, which shall have passed the two branches of the legislature, for reconsideration; and the bill so returned is to become a law, if, upon that reconsideration, it be approved by two thirds of both houses.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 69



TIME OUT: ‘WHY YOU SHOULD BE EATING MORE CHEDDAR’

WSJ: “For over 150 years cheddar was the most popular cheese in the U.S. It sustained colonists and Civil War soldiers, and was the foundation for the industrial innovation of processed ‘American’ cheese. Only recently was cheddar demoted to second place in overall consumption, usurped by that ubiquitous pizza-topper, mozzarella. Though English in origin, cheddar has been part of the American experience from the very start, and today some of this country’s best cheese makers are turning out better cheddar than ever before. Cheddaring, the stacking of blocks of drained curds to extract more whey, creates a sturdy curd suited to aging. … Commodity cheddar is a publicly traded product whose destiny is frozen food, pre-shredded packs and economy supermarket wedges; specialty cheddar, made on a small scale and sold primarily at cheese counters and gourmet stores, is often preserved in wax or clothbound (wrapped in cotton cloth and rubbed with oil or lard).”

BIDEN TRIES COUNTERPUNCHING

Politico: “After calling for Donald Trump’s impeachment for the first time, Joe Biden experienced something here he rarely sees on the campaign trail: a sustained standing ovation. …[T]he former vice president’s roll-out of a swaggering, fire-breathing approach and full embrace of impeachment signaled a dramatic departure from course — a change in direction necessitated by weeks of Trump’s siege warfare. … It was his most aggressive posture to date, presenting a case that Trump could not be trusted, while positioning himself as the fighter that America needs at this moment to face off against a ‘bully’ and a ‘coward.’ … He also took a veiled shot at Elizabeth Warren, who has overtaken Biden in recent national polls and whose campaign mantra is centered on her dozens of policy plans. … Biden’s shift toward a harsher tone and his evolution on impeachment was born out of circumstance, necessity and personal animus. It came after days of privately huddling with advisers.”



Sanders retracts statement about slowing down campaign - NBC News: “Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday tamped down speculation that he would slow his presidential campaign after he suffered a heart attack last week, saying he plans to compete as vigorously as ever for the 2020 Democratic nomination. The Vermont independent told NBC in an exclusive interview airing Wednesday night on ‘Nightly News’ and Thursday on the ‘Today’ show that his health scare has only strengthened his resolve, despite telling reporters a day earlier he planned to curtail his normally packed schedule. ‘I misspoke the other day. I said a word I should not have said and media drives me a little bit nuts to make a big deal about it,’ Sanders said during the interview alongside his wife, Jane Sanders. … He added, ‘I want to start off slower and build up and build up and build up.’”



Warren refreshes vow against high-dollar fundraisers - Politico: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she will continue to swear off high-dollar campaign fundraisers in the general election if she becomes the Democratic presidential nominee, extending her self-imposed ban on the events beyond the primary and reversing an earlier statement. ‘When Elizabeth is the Democratic nominee for president, she’s not going to change a thing in how she runs her campaign,’ campaign spokeswoman Kristen Orthman said in a statement Tuesday, which Warren later amplified in a Twitter thread. … That broad statement worried some Democrats, as the party’s presidential nominee traditionally has been a big fundraiser for other candidates and Democratic committees. But in a Wednesday statement, Orthman clarified that Warren's pledge would apply only to her presidential campaign, not to raising money for the Democratic Party or other candidates.”



TEAM TRUMP GOING ALL OUT FOR MINNESOTA, YOU BETCHA

NYT: “A Republican presidential candidate has not won the state of Minnesota since Richard M. Nixon’s victory there in 1972. But President Trump has long viewed it as the one that got away. Mr. Trump barely set foot in the state during his 2016 campaign, and his field organization on the ground was nonexistent… This time, the Trump campaign is determined not to let Minnesota go without trying. So on Thursday night, Mr. Trump will arrive in Minneapolis, one of the most Democratic congressional districts in the country, for his first political rally since House Democrats began an impeachment investigation that threatens to engulf his presidency. It is a rare rally for Mr. Trump in a state he did not win in 2016, and takes him to the heart of opposition territory… Meanwhile, Brad Parscale, the president’s campaign manager, is planning to pour tens of millions of dollars into the campaign’s Minnesota operation, compared with the $30,000 the Trump campaign spent on the state last cycle. The campaign already has 20 paid staff members in the state, and expects to expand to 100.”



LOUISIANA GOVERNOR RACE HEATS UP IN CLOSING DAYS

Politico: “The last televised primary debate in Louisiana saw Republicans Ralph Abraham and Eddie Rispone go after [Democratic Gov. John Bel] Edwards — but also each other, as they seek a second-place finish in an uncertain runoff. Rispone took the opportunity to post a question to Abraham, asking why he promised to donate his congressional salary but later stopped doing so, while Abraham criticized Rispone for his past support of Common Core. The two also argued back and forth about each other’s records, with Abraham accusing Rispone of running ‘distasteful’ attack ads, and Rispone calling Abraham’s line of attack on Common Core ‘an outright lie.’ The pair of Republicans did train their fire on Edwards, too. They hit him over the state’s economy and needled him on why he backed Hillary Clinton in 2016 — an attempt to nationalize the race, with President Donald Trump, who’s been tweeting proflicially about the race, planning an election-eve visit to Lake Charles on Friday night.”



McGrath raises $10.7 million in campaign to oust McConnell - WashTimes: “Democrat Amy McGrath raised a record $10.7 million in the last three months for her bit to topple Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the Senate race in Kentucky. Ms. McGrath, a Marine fighter pilot, is the leading Democratic candidate in the race to take on Mr. McConnell, a six-term senator who is immensely unpopular in his home state. The $10.7 million that Ms. McGrath raised in the third quarter came from 299,000 donors with an average individual contribution of $36. ‘Mitch McConnell has never faced an opponent like Amy McGrath. Not only does a new independent poll show the race tied, but more than a quarter-million grassroots donations — from all 120 Kentucky counties — have provided us a record-shattering first quarter of nearly $11 million to take down McConnell and his self-serving special interest allies. Change is coming,’ said McGrath campaign manager Mark Nickolas.”

“Maybe don’t ban the tomahawk chop next time?” – Nick Ayers’, a former aide to Vice President Mike Pence, reaction to the Atlanta Braves’ first-inning struggles on Wednesday night during Game 5 of the NLDS against the St. Louis Cardinals.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Chris! Woah, woah, woah! Can we please get an emergency podcast to discuss the new Fox News poll that has 51% of Americans supporting impeachment and removal? This seems crazy, yet not entirely surprising!” – Katie Hacker, Evington, Va.



[Ed. note: I don’t know if we can manage that one, Ms. Hacker, but how about a little Bleacher banter? It may be best here to look at our excellent pollsters’ work in context. If you check out FiveThirtyEight’s very helpful averages on the subject, you’ll see that support for impeachment has been on a sharp increase. On the day when the news broke that the President Trump had sought help from the Ukrainian president in getting dirt on the Bidens, opposition to impeachment ran 11 points ahead, 51 percent to 40 percent. That was in mid-September. Today, the average stands at 49 percent in favor of impeachment and 43 percent opposed. Support among Democrats and independents has jumped 10 points or more while Republicans increased a more modest, but still significant, 4 points on average. The takeaway from our poll and every other credible pollster is that the tide has turned decisively against the president. There is still a long way to go here and public opinion on this subject is obviously malleable. But if more than 80 percent of Democrats are already on board, it’s hard to see that number declining much any time soon. That means Team Trump’s urgent work is to convince increasingly skeptical independent voters that the president deserves to remain in office. It won’t be enough to count on the anger of core Republican supporters.]



“I've been following your continued response to readers who stubbornly insist on asking for a crime worthy of impeachment. Your response is that it's not a legal issue but a political issue. As a devotee of the U.S. Constitution, I really think that your reading of the ‘high crimes and misdemeanors’ standard should actually read ‘high crimes, misdemeanors, and anything else the U.S. House of Representatives feels adequate to the occasion’ would be more of a support for your position. But, alas, such language seems to be missing. Or am I reading the wrong U.S. Constitution? Please advise.” – Bill Panagakos, Littleton, Colo.



[Ed. note: It may be helpful here to look at the intent of the Framers in devising the vehicle. Here’s what Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 65 about the purpose of impeachment: “Those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.” The phrase “high crimes and misdemeanors” was a term of art long before the Constitution was drafted. As Hamilton alludes to in the passage above, the “high” in the term refers to the office more so than the offenses. The purpose of impeachment isn’t to prosecute federal officials for crimes, but rather to remove them from office for abusing their powers and breaching the public trust. The Framers were following in the footsteps of British politician and political philosopher, Edmund Burke. In his famous speech in 1786 seeking the impeachment of the governor general of India, Warren Hastings, for self-seeking, tyrannical treatment of the crown’s Indian subjects Burke declared “the principles of honor, the spirit of cavaliers to govern here; not the low principles of jurisprudence only.” Hastings’ scandal and trial were very much on the minds of Americans during the drafting and ratification of the Constitution and Burke’s view – that “principles of honor” were essential to consider – was the mainstream opinion on this side of the Atlantic. This is why the Senate, not the Supreme Court or some bicameral commission, was chosen to sit in judgment. Here’s Hamilton again: “The prosecution of them, for this reason, will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused. In many cases it will connect itself with the pre-existing factions, and will enlist all their animosities, partialities, influence, and interest on one side or on the other; and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties, than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.” Sound familiar? The Senate, then indirectly elected by state legislatures, with its members serving six year terms, was seen as the best home for dispassionate, fair-minded evaluations of the facts at hand without the unpleasant thought of unelected judges removing an elected president. The House, more easily incited to partisan passion and more responsive to the immediate will of the electorate, can prosecute, but the upper chamber runs the show. Whether or not you agree with their assessment, if a majority of the members of the House believe that the president has abused his office for personal gain and should be removed, they would be entirely within the American understanding of an impeachable offense. Just as it would be within that tradition for the Senate to reject their claim if its members so choose. This is how the system is supposed to work. I imagine that Democrats will end up correlating their articles with existing criminal offenses, like the solicitation of campaign help from foreign countries and obstruction, but that’s just window dressing. Appeals to honor and ethics are enough.]



“Re: your report on Trey Gowdy joining Team Trump. Is he betting all his chips on a series of events that would get him a Supreme Court nomination?” – John Lee, Walnut Creek, Calif.



[Ed. note: I wouldn’t get too far ahead of myself on this one. Gowdy’s friend and longtime fellow South Carolina Congressman Mick Mulvaney is the White House chief of staff. Gowdy is arguably the best suited man in America to go up against House Democrats in this matter. He has a strong reputation among Republicans but still enjoys some credibility among his former Democratic colleagues for his successful navigation of efforts by Trump loyalists to torch the FBI. And if anything, running point on a matter this explosively controversial and rankly partisan would diminish, rather than improve, his chances of being picked for the Supreme Court.]



“Chris and Brianna, Please tell me you took editorial liberty in quoting Federalist No. 30 and that Alexander Hamilton did not write in all caps. My image of the esteemed first Secretary of the Treasury will be forever marred if he was a precedent Twitter troll.” – Dan Burch, Turlock, Calif.



[Ed. note: Capitalization is a funny thing. We’ve only really had standard practices for the past century or so. Certainly back in 1787, it was highly irregular across the English-speaking world. If you look at our founding documents you’ll see that in those days, for example, it was conventional to capitalize nouns in the way modern German speakers do. Consider the American creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” As you can see, the capitalization of nouns isn’t even standard. Why “Rights” but not “men?” “Liberty” but not “truths?” What comes through is that capitalization was a form of emphasis, not grammatical rules. The capitalized words after the start of the sentence – “Creator,” “Rights,” “Life,” “Liberty” and “Happiness” – actually make for a kind of semaphore for the actual meaning of the sentence. The essence is there in those five key words. So yes, I’m sorry to break it to you that ALL CAPS was a thing before Twitter. And you can just imagine Hamilton, eyes and pen aflame responding to the opponents of the Constitution: “IN THE USUAL PROGRESS OF THINGS, THE NECESSITIES OF A NATION, IN EVERY STAGE OF ITS EXISTENCE, WILL BE FOUND AT LEAST EQUAL TO ITS RESOURCES.” There’s no record of whether Patrick Henry wrote back “u mad bro?”]

WHAT I LEARNED IN CHICK-FIL-A TRAINING IS…

WBNS: “A Chick-fil-A employee went above and beyond to help a customer having a bad day. Shauna Hall was getting out of her van when she dropped her phone in the parking lot of a Chick-fil-A in Stafford, Virginia. The phone fell into a storm drain. … That’s when Seth, a digital marketing director with Chick-fil-A, said he would help. After cleaning his finger after slicing it trying to remove the manhole cover to the drain, Seth went into the storm drain and retrieved Hall’s phone. It didn’t break in the fall and wasn’t wet. ‘As he was about to climb out of the hole he asked me to snap a picture so he could show his girlfriend what he did at work today,’ Hall said. Seth’s shift had just ended, yet he didn’t hesitate to stay and help a customer in need.”

* A day after saying he intended to scale back his campaign schedule in the wake of his heart attack, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) told NBC News yesterday he “misspoke” and intends to “get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign.”

* On a related note, the Vermont senator said he knew about the heart attack for a few days before it was disclosed to the public, but Sanders added that he’s nevertheless comfortable with the way his campaign handled the matter. “No apologies,” he said.

* Joe Biden yesterday made an unequivocal statement in support for Donald Trump’s impeachment, a step he’d previously been reluctant to take.

* On a related note, the former vice president’s campaign sent a written complaint to New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet yesterday, questioning the newspaper’s decision to publish an op-ed from Peter Schweizer and pointing to what Team Biden sees as a larger pattern of “journalistic malpractice.”

* And speaking of Biden’s campaign, it also reached out to Facebook about taking down a Trump campaign attack ad that includes demonstrably false claims. The social-media giant refused.

* Despite having qualified for next week’s Democratic presidential primary debate, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) is now saying she may boycott the event in order to protest a process she believes is “rigged” against her and candidates like her.

* Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said this week that she would continue to forgo big-dollar fundraising events, even if she wins her party’s presidential nomination next year. The senator later clarified, however, that she’d headline high-dollar events for the Democratic Party, but not to benefit her own campaign directly.

* And Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas) was planning to retire at the end of this Congress, but she announced late yesterday that she’ll run for re-election one last time next year."

* Louisiana will hold its first round of balloting tomorrow in its gubernatorial race, and Donald Trump will visit the state tonight to rally the Republican troops. Incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) is expected to outpace his GOP rivals, and if Edwards tops the 50% threshold tomorrow, there will be no second round of voting next month.

* Speaking of presidential travel, Trump was in Minneapolis last night for an unusually long campaign rally, at which he attacked all kinds of foes, targeting Joe Biden with particular zeal.

* Former Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) was planning a comeback next year, but now that he appears to be “Congressman-1” in the indictment of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman – Rudy Giuliani’s associates who were arrested this week – the Texan’s political future is again in doubt.

* On a related note, many of the Republicans who received contributions from Parnas and Fruman are scrambling to either give the money back or donate it to charity.

* While most national Democratic presidential primary polls show Joe Biden’s lead over Elizabeth Warren disappearing, Fox News’ latest national poll shows the former vice president leading the Massachusetts senator, 32% to 22%. Bernie Sanders is third in the poll with 17%. (Also of interest, Beto O’Rourke reached 3% in the Fox poll, which moves him a little closer to qualifying for the party’s November primary debate.)

* As for the general election, Fox’s poll found Biden and Warren leading Trump by 10 points each, while Sanders leads the president in a hypothetical match-up by nine points.

* Forty-five years ago, Rep. Larry Hogan Sr. (R-Md.) was the first Republican on the House Judiciary Committee to vote to impeach Richard Nixon. Yesterday, his son, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan Jr. (R), announced his support for Congress’ impeachment inquiry into Trump.

* And in a bit of a surprise, House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) announced yesterday that she’ll retire at the end of this Congress. Her district, which Hillary Clinton carried by 20 points, is expected to remain in Democratic hands."

Bernie Sanders is trying to allay speculation that he would be cutting back on his campaign appearances after suffering a heart attack last week.

The 78-year-old independent senator from Vermont emphasized at the beginning of a video he sent to supporters and posted on Twitter on Thursday that “I am feeling great. I am getting my endurance back and I look forward to getting out on the campaign trail as soon as possible.”

And to hammer home the point, the populist lawmaker, who’s making his second straight White House bid, concluded the video by highlighting that “I am feeling really good. I’m getting stronger every day. We’re going to be out there on the campaign trail. We’re going to be in the debate in Columbus, Ohio next week.”

SANDERS SAID HE MISSPOKE ON SLOWING PACE OF HIS CAMPAIGN

Sanders has been off the campaign trail since being hospitalized early last week after he experienced chest pains at an event in Nevada. He’s been resting at his Vermont home since being released from the hospital on Friday.

Sanders, who's the oldest candidate in either party running in the 2020 presidential campaign, told reporters outside his home earlier this week that he would be slowing the pace of his normally frenetic campaigning.

“We were doing in some cases five or six meetings a day, three or four rallies and town meetings and meeting with groups of people,” he explained. “I don't think I'm going to do that. But I certainly intend to be actively campaigning. I think we can change the nature of the campaign a bit. Make sure that I have the strength to do what I have to do.""

Those comments made headlines, sparking speculation about Sanders’ endurance.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

In an interview Wednesday with NBC News, Sanders said: ""I misspoke the other day. I said a word I should not have said and media drives me a little bit nuts to make a big deal about it.”

""We're going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign, I love doing rallies and I love doing town meetings,” he explained before adding that ""I want to start off slower and build up and build up and build up.""

In Wednesday’s interview, Sanders also pushed back against criticism that his campaign was not transparent about the heart attack. When he was hospitalized, his campaign initially said it was because of a blockage in the senator’s artery.

""That's nonsense,"" Sanders said. ""I don't know what people think campaigns are, you know we're dealing with all kinds of doctors and we wanted to have a sense of what the hell was going on…I think we acted absolutely appropriately."""

Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, both of whom have called for a crackdown on Wall Street and financial institutions.

Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren asked Belfort to weigh in on the current 2020 Democratic field, as many of the leading candidates have long criticized the financial industry.

""If one of these people gets into office, it will be a Warren or Sanders destruction.” — Jordan Belfort, Wolf of Wall Street

“Wall Street has a really, really important function, right? When Wall Street runs amok, it gets really ugly,"" said Belfort. ""What frightens me about a Bernie Sanders or an Elizabeth Warren is like they think that government is… the answer… but the policies that they're talking about will literally destroy the fabric of the country,” Belfort said.

TOMI LAHREN SITS DOWN WITH FORMER NFL STAR ARIAN FOSTER, ASKS WHY HE KNELT FOR NATIONAL ANTHEM

However, Belfort said that he believed that Trump will emerge with a victory in 2020.

“If I didn't, I wouldn't be able to sleep at night, OK? Because I think that this nation would be literally destroyed,"" he said. ""If one of these people gets into office—a Warren or Sanders—destruction.”

“He's a great salesman,"" Belfort continued, praising the president.

""I wish that he would say things in a way that p*** people off less because it doesn't help… but I can’t judge because he's president. I didn't become president, he did. I went to jail.”

Later in the episode, Belfort opened up about his notorious financial rise, devastating downfall, and how his time in prison helped reinvent his future.

“Of course, I'm remorseful about what happened,"" said Belfort, responding to Lahren, who questioned whether he regretted his past actions.

“I deserved to go to jail,"" Belfort continued. ""I definitely deserved to go to jail, it was a positive experience,” he recalled. “I thought the judge was very smart… he sentenced me to a long enough time to really [make sure]… I'll never forget—that was terrible. Yet not long enough to destroy my life, destroy my children.”

Belfort was portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in the blockbuster Hollywood movie, “The Wolf of Wall Street,” which shed light on his early life and white-collar crimes that led to his eventual time in prison.

After serving 22 months between 2004 and 2006 for securities fraud totaling over $200 million, Belfort was also ordered to return $110 million to investors.

""The judge was very smart… he sentenced me to a long enough time to really [make sure]… I'll never forget that was terrible, Yet not long enough to destroy my life, destroy my children.” — Jordan Belfort, Wolf of Wall Street

Following his time in prison, Belfort worked on his sobriety and began to write his book -- which would serve as a basis for the film. Belfort described becoming sober and writing the book as pivotal experiences in his path to rehabilitation.

“When I wrote the book it was like… self-therapy to look back and examine all your actions… I love the movie—obviously, some things were fictionalized to serve the narrative so to speak… There are some things that bothered me that I thought made me look worse than I was and other things that probably didn't look as bad as I was,” Belfort recalled.

The 2013 film reportedly made an estimated $400 million worldwide and gained Belfort widespread recognition, kicking off his second career as a motivational speaker.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., as his daughter-in-law, Rainè Riggs, died of cancer shortly after she was diagnosed.

The shocking news came as Sanders was recovering from a heart attack he suffered last week, which forced him to temporarily suspend campaign events while he recuperated.

The 46-year-old Riggs reportedly died Saturday, two days after her diagnosis and the day Sanders returned to Vermont following his release from the hospital. She was suffering from neuroendocrine cancer, which causes rare tumors to sprout up on various parts of the body.

BERNIE SANDERS RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL, DOCTORS SAY HE SUFFERED HEART ATTACK

Riggs’ obituary says she worked as a neuropsychologist and frequently volunteered with pediatric hospice. She was married to Bernie's son Levi Sanders and met him while they both worked at a food shelter in Vermont. They had three children.

The obituary also states Riggs worked as the director of behavioral medicine at Dartmouth Medical School and was the owner of Riggs Geriatric Psychology.

Sanders received an outpouring of support on Twitter from media figures and his fellow political colleagues, including Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., fellow 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang, and Meghan McCain.

Bernie Sanders' controversial statement that ""there should be no billionaires.""

BERNIE SANDERS: 'BILLIONAIRES SHOULD NOT EXIST'

""Well, Mark, that’s easy for you to say, since you are worth an estimated $70 billion dollars and since – despite the best efforts of people like Bernie Sanders – we are not yet a socialist nation and you know that money won’t be confiscated from you,"" Lahren said in her Fox Nation daily commentary, ""Final Thoughts.""

Zuckerberg was speaking during a recent livestreamed question-and-answer session with Facebook employees when he made the surprising assertion.

Asked to respond to Sanders' declaration that billionaires should not exist, Zuckerberg – the fifth richest person in the world – offered his unexpected take.

ZUCKERBERG SIDES WITH BERNIE SANDERS ON BILLIONAIRES

“I understand where he’s coming from,” Zuckerberg said. “I don’t know if I have an exact threshold on what amount of money someone should have but on some level, no one deserves to have that much money.”

Lahren went after the billionaire, slamming him for his ""hypocritical"" support of Sanders and his call to prevent Americans from attaining ""billionaire"" status.

""Looks like slamming capitalism, while benefiting from capitalism, is quite lucrative ... I’m sure it is easy for you to sit in one of your 10 properties and ponder whether you deserve it...while basking in it all,"" she said.

FACEBOOK CEO THREATENS LAWSUIT AGAINST ELIZABETH WARREN

Later in the segment, Lahren applauded Zuckerberg's plan to donate 99 percent of his Facebook shares to charity, specifically the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative – which uses technology to solve challenges like eradicating disease and reforming the criminal justice system – but noted that his decision to do so represented the very premise on which capitalism was founded on.

""That’s fantastic,"" said Lahren, ""but in a way, this only makes my point. Zuckerberg was able to achieve and attain his billions by working hard – harder than most – taking chances, building a company and a mega-brand via innovation and capitalist principles,"" she said.

FACEBOOK CEO MEETS WITH TRUMP, KEY SENATORS

""Think Facebook could have been founded in Cuba or Venezuela? Think again,"" she continued, referring to countries ruled largely by socialism.

Later in the segment, Lahren doubled down on her praise of the current capitalist structure in the U.S. and warned against redistribution of wealth.

""Zuck chooses to donate huge sums of his money the way he sees fit — not by government dictate or mandate. Would he prefer to pledge that estimated $67 billion in Facebook stock to the U.S. government? Send it to the swamp so the bureaucrats could divvy it up the way they see fit? I don’t think so,"" the Fox Nation host said.

BARR ASKS FACEBOOK CEO TO STOP END-TO-END ENCRYPTION PROGRAMS

""Whether Zuck wants to admit it or not,"" she continued, ""he knows taxation, confiscation and over-regulation kill innovation. He also believes he knows how to spend his money better than the almighty government. He lives his life like a compassionate capitalist and still feels like he must bow down to wannabe socialists like Bernie Sanders. Ridiculous,"" said Lahren.

The Fox Nation host reiterated her point, expressing support for hard work and unlimited financial potential — and urged liberals to ""butt out.""

""I am sick of these liberals telling us what we deserve and don't deserve,"" she concluded. ""This is America, we deserve what we work hard to earn ... butt out.""

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HE WAS 'MORE FATIGUED' IN MONTHS LEADING UP TO HEART ATTACK BUT IGNORED SYMPTOMS

Sanders was at a campaign rally in Nevada last Tuesday when he began complaining of chest pains.

""Somebody said, do you want to do selfies and I said, 'My God, do I not want to do selfies. Let me get the hell out of here,'"" he recalled. The discomfort prompted Sanders to visit an urgent care facility.

""They did a few tests and the doctor there said, she said, 'You're having a heart event,' and it just struck me. I could not believe it,"" Sanders said.

After Sanders was released from a Nevada hospital on Friday, the campaign disclosed that the 78-year-old had suffered a heart attack. However, Sanders pushed back on claims that his campaign tried to hide or conceal his health ailments from voters.

""No I don't accept that,"" Sanders said. ""That's nonsense and I think that sometimes, you know, I don't know what people think campaigns are. We're dealing with all kinds of doctors and we wanted to have a sense of what the hell was going on really. So the first thing that we're trying to do is understand what's going on and not run to The New York Times and not have to report every 15 minutes. This is not a baseball game. So I think we acted absolutely appropriately.""

""No apologies,"" he added.

Sanders told reporters Tuesday outside his home in Burlington, Vt., that he ""certainly intends to be actively campaigning"" but will ""change the nature"" and frequency of rallies and events to ""make sure I have the strength to do what I have to do.""

“We were doing, you know, in some cases five or six meetings a day, three or four rallies and town meetings and meeting with groups of people,” Sanders said about his campaign prior to his heart attack. “I don’t think I’m going to do that.”

Sanders said he ""misspoke"" when he suggested he would slow his pace on the campaign trail, but his wife, Jane O'Meara Sanders, said Wednesday that her husband has postponed all campaign events until next Tuesday when he will head to Ohio for the fourth Democratic debate."

""If she does get in, here's what she's looking at: She's looking at Joe, who looks like toast right now -- she's looking at Bernie who has to coast because of his health,"" he said of 2020 hopefuls former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

""Her only opponent is Liz Warren.""

Watters claimed Warren would have to be chosen as her running mate in order for the former secretary of state to have a shot at the party nomination.

He said Clinton could convince Democratic voters by reminding them she beat Trump in the popular vote and in other categories other than the actual elector tally.

""I outraised him, I out-debated him, I could beat him again if I just go to Wisconsin,"" Watters said, imitating what Clinton would say.

Watters said Sanders would have to be guaranteed a cabinet nomination, in order for Clinton to gain the support of the Vermont senator's energized base.

Watters also called out what he claimed was a potential double standard, saying Trump would be vilified in the media if House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., subpoenaed a single email -- and the president ""acid-washed"" it and claimed it was about golf.

He said Clinton has gone without much media scrutiny for her own email scandal."

Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, is threatening to boycott next week’s Democratic presidential debate amid accusations that the Democratic National Committee and the media are “rigging” the 2020 primary elections against dark horse candidates like herself.

Gabbard, who reached the qualification thresholds for next Tuesday’s debate in Ohio, called the qualifications “arbitrary” and said DNC leaders “are trying to hijack the entire election process.” She said she will decide in the next few days whether she will participate in the debate.

“The DNC and corporate media are trying to hijack the entire election process,” Gabbard said in a video posted on Twitter. “In order to bring attention to this serious threat to our democracy, and ensure your voice is heard, I am giving serious consideration to boycotting the next debate on October 15th.”

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Gabbard’s complaint about the DNC “rigging” the primary election dredges up similar objections from 2016 when the DNC was accused of favoring former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

“The 2016 Democratic Primary election was rigged by the DNC and their partners in the corporate media against Bernie Sanders,” Gabbard said. “In this 2020 election, the DNC and corporate media are rigging the election again, but this time against the American people in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada.”

Gabbard’s move to possibly boycott the debate is a double-edged sword for the candidate, as she would miss the opportunity to reach millions of voters tuning into the debate, while the boycott would draw a great deal of attention to her campaign. The Hawaii Democrat did not qualify for September’s DNC debate in Houston, but has met the criteria of 130,000 unique donors and hitting at least 2 percent in four approval polls to qualify for Tuesday’s debate.

Twelve candidates have qualified for Tuesday’s debate – leaving four who are still in the race on the sidelines.

“They are attempting to replace the roles of voters in the early states, using polling and other arbitrary methods which are not transparent or democratic, and holding so-called debates which are not debates at all but rather commercialized reality television meant to entertain, not inform or enlighten,” Gabbard said. “In short, the DNC and corporate media are trying to hijack the entire election process.”

To qualify for November’s debate, a candidate must reach 165,000 unique donors and reach 3 percent in four approved polls. So far only eight candidates have hit that mark, with Gabbard not being among them."

""I'm a little surprised because there has been so much in the press about how Warren is charging,"" he said.

Biden stays on top in the race with 32 percent support among primary voters, up 3 points since September. He’s followed by Elizabeth Warren at 22 percent -- that’s up 6 points and a new high for her. Bernie Sanders is at 17 percent, down 1 point since last month.

While Biden’s support has stayed between 29-35 percent since March, his current 10-point advantage is about half of his 19-point lead in June.

The rundown continues with Kamala Harris at 5 percent, Pete Buttigieg at 4 percent, Beto O’Rourke at 3 percent, and Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang each at 2 percent. Michael Bennet, Julian Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Tim Ryan, Tom Steyer, and Marianne Williamson receive 1 percent apiece.

Biden retains top billing with strong support among non-whites, voters over age 45, and moderates/conservatives. Warren has strengthened her position by increasing support among suburban voters, very liberals, and men.

When Democratic primary voters’ first and second choice preferences are considered together, Biden and Warren tie at 45 percent support, Sanders is at 34 percent, Harris 15 percent and Buttigieg 13 percent.

President Trump’s allegations about improper actions by Biden and his son have so far failed to chip away at Biden’s support in the primary race -- and Democratic primary voters continue to believe the former vice president is the candidate best equipped to beat Trump in 2020: 43 percent feel that way, up from 42 percent last month. Nineteen percent think Warren has the best chance to oust Trump and 15 percent say Sanders.

At the same time, the poll finds the three top Democratic candidates with sizable leads over the president in potential head-to-head matchups.

The poll, released Thursday, shows Biden (50-40 percent) and Warren (50-40 percent) both top Trump by 10 points, and Sanders is up by 9 (49-40 percent). This marks the first time all three Democrats have held a lead outside the poll’s margin of error. Last month, Biden was up by 14 points, Warren by 6 and Sanders by 8.

“If Warren continues to poll as strongly against Trump as the former vice president, it makes it increasingly difficult for the Biden team to keep making the argument he is the most electable candidate,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican Daron Shaw.

The impeachment inquiry hasn’t caused any real shifts in the ballot test, as Trump’s support in the two-way matchups has been between 37-42 percent all year. However, the poll finds an 8-point shift since last month in the number expecting Trump will be re-elected. In September, more thought he would win by a 6-point margin and now more expect he won’t by 2 points.

And while most Republican primary voters want to keep Trump as their party’s nominee, nearly one in five, 17 percent, would like to see someone else run.

“So far, Trump has been able to keep his Republican base on board,” says Shaw. “If the percentage opposing his re-nomination creeps into the 20s, that would be a troubling sign.”

Meanwhile, voters continue to believe Donald Trump is dishonest. Sixty-three percent say that -- far more than the 35 percent who think he is honest and trustworthy. By the way, that’s the same number who said Trump was honest before he won the 2016 election.

Vice President Mike Pence does a bit better than his boss, although not by much: 39 percent say he’s honest and 54 percent say dishonest.

On the other side, each of the top three Democratic candidates receives positive ratings on this measure. Sanders performs best with 59 percent saying he is honest and trustworthy (36 percent disagree). Fifty percent think Warren is honest vs. 44 percent dishonest, and for Biden voters split 48-47 percent.

Among Democrats, 87 percent think Sanders is honest and trustworthy, while 81 percent feel that way about Warren and 75 percent Biden. Seventy-three percent of Republicans say Trump is honest.

Currently, 51 percent of voters have a favorable opinion of Sanders, while 43 percent view him negatively. That puts him in positive territory by 8 points. More view Warren positively by 7 points (46 favorable vs. 39 unfavorable) and Biden by 6 (50 favorable vs. 44 unfavorable).

The ratings are closer to even for Buttigieg (+3 points), Yang (+3), Booker (-2), Harris (-3) and O’Rourke (-4). They each also have large numbers who have never heard of them or have no opinion of them. For example, 43 percent of voters are unable to rate Yang, while 36 percent can’t rate Buttigieg and 32 percent can’t rate Booker.

Voters view Trump more negatively than positively by 13 points (43-56). His personal favorable rating was underwater by 22 points in the days leading up to the 2016 election (38-60).

Twice as many primary voters say Trump’s allegations make them more likely to vote for Biden (21 percent more vs. 10 percent less), while twice as many say health concerns make them less (31 percent) rather than more likely (15 percent) to vote for Sanders in the primary.

Sanders is off the campaign trail since suffering a heart attack October 3. He’s 78 years old, while Biden is 76, Trump is 73, and Warren is 70.

""If there is an upset in Iowa, or even a close vote, and New Hampshire and it appears that Elizabeth Warren is the one that can beat Donald Trump, a lot of that vote will switch because a lot of the pro-Biden vote or the pro-any of the Democrats votes are based on anti-Trump,"" Sharpton said.

Homelessness in Los Angeles County and across Western states is skyrocketing. In 2019 so far, the number of homeless residents in Los Angeles has risen 12 percent from 2018, according to county statistics.

“We need a FEMA-like, Red Cross-like, National Guard-like [solution],"" said Rev. Andy Bales, the CEO of L.A.’s largest homeless shelter, Union Rescue Mission. ""Army Corps of Engineers needs to come and we need to figure out immediately how to get 44,000 people off the streets.""

Candidate plans that are more forward-looking, like five to 10 years down the road with millions of dollars in investment in affordable housing units, can be good in theory and are necessary, these advocates say, but don’t address “chronic” homelessness, or those who have lived out on the streets for six months or more in the past year.

HOMELESS MAN RANDOMLY PICKS UP 6-YEAR-OLD, SLAMS HIM ON CONCRETE: REPORT

“We’ve been doing $600,000 to $700,000 per person, per unit, and it’s planned over the next 10 years and that will not get it done,” Bales says. He added that only one candidate has reached out to him on how to remedy the situation.

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary under President Obama Julian Castro and Beto O’ Rourke have actually visited homeless encampments on Skid Row, a notoriously expansive homeless encampment in downtown Los Angeles.

O’Rourke released a plan this week similar to Castro’s and Sen. Bernie Sanders’ plans, saying he wants to triple funding for homeless assistance grants through HUD providing $50 billion over the next 10 years, fully funding housing choice vouchers, capping rent increases, and pumping investment in dilapidated public housing units.

But for those who study the issue of homelessness, they say the problem should be coming up more in candidate rhetoric and dialogue as they campaign. It’s not so much to just have a job to maintain housing, they say, because rent prices have become so unsustainable.

“I think it’s becoming an intractable issue because we don’t have the investment and broader solutions to homelessness, which is why I think many of the presidential candidates are focused on affordable housing….it’s still something that’s just emerging and most of the candidates have not yet addressed,"" said Christopher Herring, a UCLA PhD student.

Herring said affordable housing is the main way to go, but there needs to be more steps done to prevent people from becoming homeless in the first place and notes that with Castro and Sanders’ plans, respectively, much of the dollar figures they’re proposing will be spent quickly and frivolously unless backed up by creating and maintaining affordable housing quickly and cost-efficiently.

""To put it another way, that expansion of the billions of dollars for homelessness in Castro and Sanders plans will be pissed away quickly and a waste of taxpayer money if not backed up by more robust structural reform in the production and preservation of affordable housing.""

TOMI LAHREN: CA DEMOCRATS IGNORING HOMELESS 'EPIDEMIC' IN FAVOR OF TRUMP IMPEACHMENT PUSH

California’s Democratic primary will be early in 2020, moving up to March from June, making the state in play again for candidates vying for the nomination with 500 delegates up for grabs.

Voters in the state have homelessness high on their list of issues. Some in Los Angeles county say it even trumps traffic and the environment in what needs to be fixed first in the city.

But ultimately, homeless people have very little, if any political power as a constituency, which could be why voters haven’t heard about the problem in states other than California.

“For the most part, the people who are experiencing homelessness are not voting, at least they’re not voting en masse, they don’t have a strong political voice, they don’t have political champions, and elected officials who are sensitive to what their constituents want or else they’re going to get voted out of office, it’s not a constituency they have to pay a lot of attention to,” said Adam Murray, executive director of LA’s Inner City Law Center.

California senator and presidential candidate Kamala Harris is supporting a bill in the Senate to provide $13 billion in emergency relief to areas affected by chronic homelessness over the next five years. But Republicans are unlikely to bring it up for a vote, citing the huge price tag.

Harris has blamed the Trump administration for cutting off funding to support what local government needs around affordable housing.

President Trump, on the other hand, has spoken about the issue on Twitter and at his rallies numerous times, largely in irreverent tones.

At a rally in Cincinnati in August, he said, ""What they are doing to our beautiful California is a disgrace to our country...It's a shame. The world is looking at it. Look at Los Angeles with the tents and the horrible, horrible conditions. Look at San Francisco, look at some of your other cities.""

Herring says California needs a federal response like what Trump is suggesting, saying, ""Trump has drawn attention to this and it’s woken up the Democratic candidates to putting forward and putting pressure on them to make real solutions.”"

""It's a fair question -- why today and why now?"" Sanders opened by saying, in reference to Biden telling a New Hampshire crowd earlier Wednesday he now backs impeaching Trump.

""I think the acts of the last 15 days are what moved Vice President Biden to this position. Fifteen days ago, Vice President Biden was in Wilmington, Delaware, and he gave a statement.

Nixon resigned before he could be impeached, while Clinton was impeached by the House but a Senate vote did not garner enough support to remove him from office.

The Turkish leader is also warning the European Union Thursday not to call Ankara's incursion into Syria an ""invasion,"" and renewed his threat of ""opening the gates"" and letting Syrian refugees flood into Europe.

In a statement released by the White House, the president said, ""The United States does not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea. Turkey has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place—and we will hold them to this commitment.""

He also later told reporters that he would employ ""far more than sanctions"" against Turkey if the country fails to act in the most ""humane way"" possible and that he hoped Erdogan would act rationally.

Fox News: “Together Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren capture the support of more than half of Democratic primary voters, according to the latest Fox News national poll on the 2020 election. Biden stays on top in the race with 32 percent support among primary voters, up 3 points since September. He’s followed by Elizabeth Warren at 22 percent -- that’s up 6 points and a new high for her.

The rundown continues with Kamala Harris at 5 percent, Pete Buttigieg at 4 percent, Beto O’Rourke at 3 percent, and Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang each at 2 percent. Michael Bennet, Julian Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Tim Ryan, Tom Steyer, and Marianne Williamson receive 1 percent apiece.”



Biden’s firewall still strong - WaPo: “[Contrary] to the expectations of analysts, the fears of supporters and the hopes of rivals, Biden maintains a sizable loyal following. Nowhere is that more evident than in the African American community, recent interviews suggest, especially in states like South Carolina, which holds a crucial early primary. Martha Beck, a retired high school teacher from Charleston … gushed about Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) but said Sanders is ‘too old and grumpy and he just shouts at people all the time.’ And she doesn’t think the same country that elected [Donald] Trump would put Warren, or any other woman, in the White House four years later.”



Will any Dem dare mention the swampy stuff? - NYT: “It’s the one question about impeachment that no Democratic presidential candidate wants to answer head on. Should Joe Biden’s son Hunter have been allowed to sit on the board of a foreign company while his father served as vice president? In the past few weeks, Mr. Biden and his campaign team have spent significant amounts of time and energy denouncing any whiff of impropriety between his son’s work and his service as vice president. … So far, none of the Democratic primary candidates have taken a hard swing at Mr. Biden, focusing instead on the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. But a few are, quite delicately, trying to raise some concerns. … In past debates, candidates who have taken on Mr. Biden’s personal characteristics, like his age, have faced blowback. The questions surrounding his son may be even more sensitive… Echoing an attack introduced and continually leveraged — in false ways — by Mr. Trump could risk raising Democrats’ ire.”



Jane Sanders takes starring role in husband’s campaign - NYT: “When it comes time to make critical decisions regarding his presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders often relies on a committee of two: himself and his wife, Jane Sanders. … When doctors confirmed to her on Thursday that Mr. Sanders had suffered a heart attack, she said, it was her decision to wait until he was discharged the next day to release that information. And when it was time to say publicly that Mr. Sanders would be easing the pace of his campaigning after his heart attack, Ms. Sanders … stood beside him to explain the reason: His closest advisers, ‘especially me,’ had told him to slow down. … In a rare interview on Wednesday at their home in Burlington, Ms. Sanders said it would be ‘egotistical’ to call herself Mr. Sanders’s top adviser but allowed that she was ‘very much a close adviser.’ Above all, she said, she was ‘his wife.’”



Voter intensity on both sides through the roof - Gallup: “A year before the 2020 presidential election, roughly seven in 10 Democrats and Republicans say they have given ‘quite a lot of thought’ to the election. About half of political independents have done so. The lack of a Republican-Democratic difference in thought given to the election is notable because Republicans usually have an advantage over Democrats, including in each of the past seven final presidential pre-election surveys, as well as in most surveys conducted throughout presidential election years historically. The current results are based on combined data from interviews with more than 2,400 U.S. adults aged 18 and older, conducted between Aug. 15 and Sept. 30, 2019. Gallup has measured thought given to the election since 1952, and it has shown a relationship to actual voter turnout among all Americans in past elections.”

“It seldom happens in the negotiation of treaties, of whatever nature, but that perfect SECRECY and immediate DESPATCH are sometimes requisite.

TIME OUT: ‘A STATUE OF FLORENTINE BRONZE’

Paris Review: “In the late summer of 1866, a black equestrian stuntwoman made her Paris debut and galvanized the city. She was known only as ‘Sarah the African,’ and history has left us few traces of her: just some battered posters, inky clippings, and burlesque scripts. Sarah was, in the words of the men who wrote about her, ‘the finest horsewoman of the King of Morocco,’ ‘an Ethiopian,’ or ‘a statue of Florentine bronze.’ A ‘negress’ who performed as neither slave nor clown, whose name evoked Sarah Baartman, the Khoikhoi woman dissected by Georges Cuvier just a few decades before in Paris, and Selika, the queen heroine of Meyerbeer’s hit posthumous opera, L’Africaine. She was a woman named for a whole continent. … On her debut in September she was billed above Méphistophélès the bareback horse, above a race of forty horses all mounted by women, above the rubber horseman, William Meyer, and even above Mlle Adèle, who made her Sidy-Laraby dance with no reins.”

GIULIANI’S WOES MOUNT

ABC News: “The business relationship between President Donald Trump's private lawyer Rudy Giuliani and the men charged Thursday in a campaign finance scheme is a subject of the ongoing criminal investigation being conducted by federal authorities in New York, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The investigation became public after the FBI had to quickly move to arrest Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman before they boarded a flight out of the country from Washington Dulles Airport with one-way tickets. They have been named as witnesses in the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Trump. The investigation is being conducted by the FBI's New York field office and prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, the same U.S. Attorney's office Giuliani ran before he became mayor of New York.”



Former Ambassador to Ukraine cites Giuliani pressure campaign - AP: “Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told lawmakers Friday that President Donald Trump pressured the State Department to oust her from her position. Yovanovitch said in an opening statement obtained by The Associated Press that she was ‘abruptly’ recalled in May and told the president had lost confidence in her. She said she was told by an official that there was a ‘concerted campaign against me’ and that Trump had pressured officials to remove her for almost a year. ‘Although I understand that I served at the pleasure of the president, I was nevertheless incredulous that the U.S. government chose to remove an ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives,’ Yovanovitch wrote in the statement.”



Report: Trump pushed Tillerson to help a Giuliani client - WaPo: “President Trump sought to enlist then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in the fall of 2017 to work with Rudolph W. Giuliani to help stop the prosecution of a Turkish Iranian gold trader represented by the former New York mayor, according to people with knowledge of the request. Trump urged Tillerson in an Oval Office meeting to try to craft a diplomatic ‘deal’ to stop the U.S. case against Reza Zarrab on corruption charges in exchange for concessions from Turkey. The request shocked the then-secretary of state, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations involving the president. At the time, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was personally lobbying Trump to get the charges dropped. Trump, in turn, repeatedly raised the topic with Tillerson — including directly in the Oval Office meeting, according to people with knowledge of the episode.”



Pete Session’s political revival threatened by Ukraine role - NYT: “Former Representative Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican who is seeking a return to Congress, was caught in the fallout of the Ukraine scandal on Thursday when he was referred to in the indictment of two presidential allies accused of campaign finance allegations. Mr. Sessions, who served 11 terms in Congress until he was swept out last year, is described as ‘Congressman-1’ in the indictment of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were arrested and charged on Thursday with illegally funneling foreign money to American political candidates and campaigns. The two men are associates of Rudolph W. Giuliani… Mr. Sessions’s appearance in the indictment, which was filed just a week after he announced he would run for Congress in 2020, was an early and potentially damaging blow to his campaign. Mr. Sessions is not named in the indictment, nor is he accused of any wrongdoing. On Thursday, he issued a statement that denied any wrongdoing and said he had no knowledge of the scheme detailed by federal prosecutors.”



Continetti: We are all Ukrainians - Free Beacon: “From Varsity Blues to Jeffrey Epstein, from China and the NBA to Ukraine and Hunter Biden, Americans are taking a crash course on the ways in which powerful people manipulate the system for personal advantage and globalization merges political cultures as well as economies. What has been uncovered as impeachment rolls on does nothing to spur confidence in the integrity of our system. America is exceptional, but our elites are not. Today we are all Ukrainians.”



TRUMP LEGAL TEAM TRASHES GOWDY

Yahoo: “The president’s decision to bulk up his legal team with former South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy amid a widening impeachment inquiry is drawing criticism from one of his high-profile supporters. On Wednesday morning, the day after news leaked that Gowdy was set to serve as outside counsel to the president, Victoria Toensing, a veteran Washington lawyer who has been working with Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, expressed concern and disbelief that the onetime advocate for congressional oversight would be coming onboard. ‘Trey Gowdy doesn’t know s***,’ she said. … ‘He screwed up the Benghazi hearings, and he came out with the advice to Trump, ‘Well, if you’ve done nothing wrong, just talk to Bob Mueller.’’ Toensing and her husband, Joe diGenova, work with Giuliani though they are not officially on Trump’s legal team.”



And he can’t even join until January - WashEx: “Former Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy cannot join President Trump's legal team until early next year, the president announced Thursday. Speaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump said, ‘Trey Gowdy is a terrific guy. I think there’s a problem with, he can’t start for another couple of months because of lobbying rules and regulations.’ It was only a day after Jay Sekulow, counsel to the president, announced Gowdy had joined the team to assist with the response to the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry. … Gowdy, 55, is a former federal prosecutor who retired from Congress on Jan. 3 after representing the 4th Congressional District of South Carolina for four terms. He then rejoined his old white-collar law firm, Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough. Despite his return to the legal profession, federal law prevents Gowdy from taking on Trump as a client in the impeachment fight until Jan. 3, 2020.”



DEMS DIVIDED ON TIMING OF IMPEACHMENT VOTE

Politico: “House Democrats are grappling with whether to take more steps to formalize their impeachment inquiry and silence a chief Republican criticism of their efforts, with competing factions beginning to emerge. President Donald Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill have hammered Speaker Nancy Pelosi for not holding a vote authorizing the House’s impeachment proceedings — arguing that without a vote, the entire process is illegitimate. Pelosi has refused to cave, dismissing Trump’s demand last week and insisting it is not required under the Constitution or House rules. And allies close to the speaker say her position hasn’t changed, describing the idea as the latest ‘Republican canard’ in a series of stall tactics the GOP will employ to protect Trump. … Yet some Democratic lawmakers and aides have begun to say privately — and, to a lesser extent, publicly — that the House should just vote to formalize the inquiry, robbing the GOP of its main talking point. The debate is threatening to cleave Democrats’ unified front as the White House makes the arcane procedural arguments the centerpiece of its impeachment defense.”



House members get an earful from voters back home - Politico: “The ‘Make America Great Again’ hats were in the front row Thursday night at freshman Rep. Anthony Brindisi’s first town hall event since Speaker Nancy Pelosi blessed an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. But for all the criticism the centrist Democrat faced from pro-Trump voters, the sharper questions came from his own supporters about why he is one of just seven in his caucus who has refused to endorse the impeachment push. … Swing-district Democrats doggedly avoided the impeachment debate when they first got to Washington. Now they can’t avoid it. … But at dozens of town halls over the two-week recess, Brindisi and other vulnerable freshmen had to fend for themselves — serving as the party’s on-the-ground voices on impeachment. Whether they can deliver a message that resonates could determine Democrats’ chances of winning over the public and holding on to their seats and the House majority in 2020.”



Independents’ support for impeachment jumps 10 points - NPR: “A slim majority of Americans now approve of the Democratic House-led impeachment inquiry into President Trump, a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds. Fifty-two percent say they approve of the inquiry, while 43% disapprove. That's a slight increase in support from two weeks ago, when 49% approved and 46% disapproved. The numbers are in line with other polls that have been released this week also showing majority support or an increase in support for the inquiry. The uptick in support in the NPR poll comes mostly from a swing among independents. In late September, more independents disapproved of the inquiry than approved, by a 50-44% margin. Now, in a reversal, more independents approve of the inquiry than disapprove, by a 54-41% margin, a net change of 19 points. On the questions of whether Trump should be impeached or removed from office, Americans are split — 49-47% in favor of impeachment and 48-48% on whether the Senate should vote to remove him.”



ROMNEY STEPS UP HIS ROLE FOR GOP

Politico: “President Donald Trump wants to sideline Mitt Romney — but the Utah senator isn’t having it. Even as he faces a barrage of attacks from the president and his allies, Romney is mapping out plans to play a central role in 2020 — headlining party events, shelling out cash from his campaign war chest, and hitting up his donor network for vulnerable senators on the ballot next year.Later this month, Romney will take his most aggressive step yet to insert himself into the 2020 campaign when he hosts a New York City fundraiser for Maine Sen. Susan Collins, Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner and Michigan Senate hopeful John James. All are establishment-aligned figures confronting tough races in swing states. Behind the scenes, Romney’s team has also begun directing his donors to help GOP candidates in Senate battlegrounds. Romney aides say he's always intended to help in competitive Senate races and that his desire to do so has never been influenced by Trump’s efforts to ostracize him.”



Dems eye Chelsea Clinton for New York House seat - NYT: “Ms. [Nita] Lowey’s announcement set off a wave of speculation about other potential contenders, including Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, as well as a state assemblyman, David Buchwald. Last year, when asked if she envisioned running for elected office, Chelsea Clinton told The Journal News, which covers the Hudson Valley, that ‘if someone were to step down or retire,’ she would ‘have to think if it’s the right choice for me.’ Ms. Clinton did not mention any particular office, although she is clearly familiar with Ms. Lowey’s district: Her parents’ house in Chappaqua, N.Y., is in the district. Ms. Clinton herself does not live in Westchester, but congressional candidates are not required to live in the district they represent. A representative for Ms. Clinton did not return a request for comment. Mr. Buchwald said he would make an announcement within a few days.”



Ocasio-Cortez draws credible primary challenger - Fox News: “A prominent New York City Democrat filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) Thursday to launch a primary challenge for the House of Representatives seat currently held by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y. City Council member Fernando Cabrera said he believes a moderate Democrat such as himself could beat the socialist Ocasio-Cortez. He plans to target her far-left views and highlight his belief that she is a ‘no show’ in the district. ‘Only a Democrat is going to be able to defeat her, and it’s going to be a moderate Democrat,’ Cabrera, who represents a Bronx City Council district, told Politico. ‘She’s a no-show in the district. She hasn’t brought about anything except division within the party.’ ‘Socialism doesn’t work,’ Cabrera added.”



Pompeo ally steps aside in Kansas Senate race - The Wichita [Kan.] Eagle: “A Kansas business leader with longtime ties to Mike Pompeo will not run for U.S. Senate after weighing a bid for months — renewing speculation about whether the secretary of state will enter the race. Alan Cobb, the president and CEO of the Kansas Chamber of Commerce, in the past has said he would defer to Pompeo if the chief diplomat decided to mount a campaign. Cobb, a former Koch Industries lobbyist, advised Pompeo in 2014 during a congressional primary battle against former Rep. Todd Tiahrt. He made no mention of Pompeo in a lengthy statement Thursday announcing his decision. Cobb said that ‘after months of serious deliberation, analysis, and careful and prayerful consideration with friends, colleagues and my family, I have decided that the best place for me to pursue my passion is to remain as the President and CEO of the Kansas Chamber.’”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I need your help. I don’t get what is going on with the Syria/Turkey situation. I understand the following: Trump has proclaimed that he is pulling troops from Syria after what has been a long involvement (partnering) with the Kurds. But, that doesn’t happen overnight, right? Once Trump announced the pulling of troops, Turkey is waiting on the sideline frothing at the chance to attack. They then attack, even with threats from Trump that they better not or there will once again be sanctions. Now the number of Kurds killed are rolling in, but are our troops still there? If they are, what are they doing? Is there something that Trump picked up on that is going on with the Kurds? The conspiracist side of me thinks he sniffed something out. My husband is an Iowa farmer and I work in crop insurance. We don’t have many ties to the military but sure understand how government a lot of the time just doesn’t make sense. Any insight would be appreciated.” – E’Lise Bracker, Underwood, Iowa



[Ed. note: No conspiracy here, Ms. Bracker. The number of U.S. troops in the disputed area was very small – measured in dozens. They were not a credible threat in terms of actually combating Turkey’s forces but rather something of a marker. By having the troops there, we were telling the Turks to stay out and leave our Kurdish allies alone. It was a small-scale version of the U.S. forces in South Korea: To fight, the Turks would have had to kill Americans, thereby bring our military down on their heads. Upon the president’s order, the U.S. troops were quickly out of the Turks’ zone of aggression. The Americans went to Iraq and other U.S. spots in the region, clearing the way for the Turks to start pummeling their ancient Kurdish enemies.]



“I am a huge fan of the Halftime Report and never miss it! Your struggle to remain fairly balanced is appreciated, especially by this reader who also struggles mightily to find truth and facts amid the bias and innuendo currently being passed off as ‘news.’ But I am confused by most of the polls' questions (especially the polls you quote) that seem to ask a compound question: Do you favor impeachment and removal of President Trump? I was under the impression that these are two distinct question. That impeachment is like a grand jury investigation, i.e. a procedure (in the House) designed to decide whether there are grounds for a trial (by the Senate) to decide if removal is warranted or not. Am I wrong? Please explain! And keep up the good work!!!” – Tom Scherer, Udon Thani, Thailand



[Ed. note: This is an excellent question, Mr. Scherer! Different pollsters do indeed ask these questions in different ways. The complexity of the situation is partly to blame. An “impeachment inquiry” is not a thing. It’s like a couple being “pre-engaged.” But some pollsters have been asking about it, which tends to screw things up. Getting respondents to differentiate between an “impeachment inquiry” and “impeachment” is quite a lot of hair-splitting for civilians. Our poll does it the right way (obvi) and asks whether voters support impeachment, impeachment and removal or no impeachment. Those are the three constitutional possibilities. In our poll, 4 percent of respondents said they wanted the president impeached but not removed. That adds up to 55 percent favoring impeachment and 51 percent favoring removal.]



“All my teams have long gone home for the winter. So now we have your traditional Nine in the form of the quite surprising Cardinals playing your hometown Nationals (who should be the Senators and in the American League with Walter Johnson throwing flames, but oh, well). Where do your loyalties lie?” – Mary Carol Miller, Greenwood, Miss.



[Ed. note: Hometown!? Washington, D.C.!? My place of residence, certainly. And I do love living here. But c’mon, Doc! My hometown is Wheeling, W.Va. and the Cardinals, whose order I lustily joined as a boy when my family moved to St. Louis for four years, are my baseball team. I admire the Nats’ pluck and am grateful for the chance they are affording me to watch the National League Championship Series in person. But I love the Cardinals and am absolutely over the moon with this year’s squad. What a bunch! The infield alone may be the greatest since my glory days of fandom in the mid-1980s. Matt Carpenter is an absolute rock for the team and the personification of professionalism, Paul DeJong is a clutch player (whoever heard of a slugger shortstop?) who seems like he was born to be a Cardinal, Kolten Wong surfs second base like the pros ride waves at Honoli’i in his hometown and Paul Goldschmidt has shown in his tenacity, play and quality of his character that he is truly in the right uniform. And Yadi is nothing less than a national treasure. So suffice it to say: Viva el Birdos!]



“How ‘bout them Redbirds! We miss you on Twitter where we could delight in the pure joy emanating from Cardinals gifs, memes, and tweets after a playoff series win…but the mailbag will have to do!” – Jack Whiteman, St. Louis

‘THIS IS A NUDGE TO PICK UP THE FUDGE’

AP: “Officials in a southwest Missouri city are planting small flags in piles of abandoned dog poop as part of a campaign to get residents to clean up after their pets downtown. The Police Department in Springfield, Mo., posted photos of the flags in use on its Facebook page Wednesday. The flags contain messages such as, ‘Is this your turd? ‘Cuz that's absurd’ and ‘This is a nudge to pick up the fudge.’ The campaign started this week and the department noted on Facebook that leaving behind a pet's mess in many cases violates a city ordinance. The city's Environmental Services said the flags are made of bamboo and recycled paper and downtown crews will pick them up if they have to clean up pet waste.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“The whole debate arouses dismay, and not just because of the overreaching claims of both sides. One has an instinctive feeling that religion has a place in American public life, and that both sides misunderstand it—that between sectarianism and secularism lies something else.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the New Republic on April 9, 1984.

227,Paul Steinhauser,"MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Two long-shot candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination who failed to make next week’s debate stage are taking aim at the showdowns.

“This won’t be decided by the debates. What I hear from folks time and time again is nothing meaningful came out of these debates and they’re often disconnected from peoples’ lives,” Montana Gov. Steve Bullock said Friday.

Bullock spoke with reporters from Fox News, NBC News, and NPR after headlining the ""Politics and Eggs"" speaking series, a must-stop for White House hopefuls in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire.

BULLOCK ACCUSES STEYER OF BUYING HIS WAY ONTO DEBATE STAGE

Bullock, who launched his campaign in the late spring, qualified for the second round of debates but didn’t reach the Democratic National Committee’s polling and fundraising criteria to make the cut for last month’s showdown or Tuesday’s debate, which will be held in Ohio.

The DNC’s raising the thresholds again for candidates to make the stage for November’s fifth round showdown, which will be held in Atlanta.

Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet is in a similar situation. He jumped into the race relatively late and qualified for the first two rounds of debates, but didn’t make the stage last month and won’t be in the debate spotlight next week.

“I had to make a decision on the debate stage, whether I was going to keep laundering money through Facebook to try to stay on a debate stage that was pre-season football, that wasn’t going to make a difference in the standings, or whether I was going to talk to voters directly in Iowa and New Hampshire,” Bennet explained in an interview on Tuesday with Fox News and NHTalkRadio.com.

“I decided I was going to talk to voters directly in Iowa and New Hampshire at a time when they were going to start paying attention to this race,” he emphasized.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Twelve candidates have qualified for Tuesday’s showdown. Bullock, Bennet, and four other contenders in the still extremely large but shrinking field of Democratic White House hopefuls failed to make the cut.

Most of the lower-tier candidates have fired away for months at the DNC for their debate criteria, arguing it’s unfair and winnows the field of candidates before voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina – the first four states in the primary and caucus presidential nominating calendar, get to cast their ballots.

A slightly more diplomatic Bullock said on Thursday that “the DNC was well-intentioned but I don’t think the best example is for campaigns to be spending $50 or $60 to get each individual donor…. I don’t think that’s the best way to pick a candidate or nominee.”

Pushing back against the criticism, DNC Chair Tom Perez told Fox News last month that the process has been “eminently fair” and added “we’re going “to continue to be transparent.”

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard - who failed to qualify for last month’s debate but made the stage for next week’s showdown - announced on Thursday that she may boycott next Tuesday’s debate.

GABBARD THREATENS TO BOYCOTT DEBATE TO PROTEST DNC

The congresswoman from Hawaii accused the DNC and its national media debate partners of “rigging” the primary battle against many of the lower-tier candidates and political outsiders running for the nomination.

“I am seriously considering boycotting October 15 debate to bring attention to DNC/corporate media’s effort to rig 2020 primary,” she tweeted.

Even though he’s not making the stage, Bullock says he’s marching on. He told Fox News he has enough campaign cash to survive until the first votes in the early voting states in February.

“We’re still 120 days out from any voter expressing preference. I still think there’s a lot of time for this,” he stressed.

And Bennet took aim at the top-tier contenders for the nomination, such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

“I think the support for the leaders in the race is very, very soft, maybe as soft as it’s ever been at this stage of the race,” he predicted."
228,Paul Steinhauser,"Joe Biden took to Twitter Thursday to declare, “President Trump picked a fight with the wrong guy.”

That’s the same line the former vice president used a day earlier – to a rousing standing ovation – as Biden, for the first time, unequivocally called for the impeachment of Trump.

While the president has been front-and-center in the Ukraine controversy that sparked House Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump, Biden’s another key player, and with the impeachment push overshadowing the 2020 White House race, the Democrat has grabbed outsized attention over his rivals for the presidential nomination.

It’s a double-edged sword for the former vice president, with Trump’s allegations against Biden’s own Ukraine connection also in the spotlight.

Biden on Wednesday launched a forceful attack on the president – coming from a candidate who in recent weeks was anything but aggressive in calling for Trump’s impeachment, unlike most of his 2020 rivals.

“We all laughed when he said he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it. It’s no joke,” Biden emphasized during two speeches in New Hampshire. “He’s shooting holes in the Constitution, and we cannot let him get away with it.”

Biden’s announcement came one day after the White House vowed not to play ball with the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, but it also came as the former vice president lost his polling status as the unrivaled front-runner. Biden’s neck-and-neck with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for the top spot in most of the recent national and early-voting-state surveys, although he held a lead in the latest Fox News Poll.

FOR FIRST TIME, BIDEN CALLS FOR TRUMP IMPEACHMENT

And, Biden was left in the dust in the race for campaign cash, with both Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont each topping him by roughly $10 million in the July-September third quarter of fundraising.

With those setbacks in mind, the unveiling of the more aggressive, in-your-face approach by Biden has been seen as considerably timely.

“It gets his sea legs under him,” noted Larry Rasky, a longtime Biden friend, adviser and fundraiser. “It gives everybody more energy.”

Rasky, who’s not directly involved in Biden’s 2020 campaign, predicted, “it’s definitely going to help fundraising.”

He added that donors “are happy to see Biden taking on the fight with intensity.”

Biden, in his speeches, taunted the president, claiming “he’s afraid of just how badly I will beat him next November.”

Veteran Democratic consultant and communications strategist Lynda Tran noted that such swagger would resonate with voters. She also said the Ukraine controversy put the spotlight on foreign relations, a wheelhouse for the former vice president.

“His remarks yesterday came across as an ‘enough is enough’ call to action and reminder to the American electorate of the fighter and statesman they have long known,” said Tran, who ran communications for the Obama-era grassroots group Organizing for America and was a founding partner of the communications firm 270 Strategies.

The impeachment inquiry was sparked by Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter over their dealings in the eastern European country. Fueled by whistleblower complaints and a transcript of the call released by the White House, Democrats argued the president was asking a foreign country to interfere in a U.S. election.

Adding to the controversy was the fact that before that phone call, millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine was put on hold. Despite allegations that Trump was using that money as leverage, Trump has insisted repeatedly that he did nothing wrong. He said there was no ""quid pro quo"" and on numerous occasions has described his conversation with the Ukrainian leader as “perfect.”

BIDEN CAMPAIGN SLAMS NY TIMES FOR OP-ED ON FORMER VP'S UKRAINE TIES

The president and allies instead have tried to put the spotlight on Biden and his son.

Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – who had faced widespread accusations of overlooking corruption in his own office – later was dismissed.

Biden, defending his actions in Ukraine, said, “there’s no truth to [Trump's] charges and attacks against me and my son. Zero.”

Biden also accused the president of throwing “lies and distortions and smears” at him and his son, “because he thinks he’ll undermine my candidacy for the nomination as well as the presidency if I am the nominee.”

While the Fox News national poll released Wednesday indicated that a majority said the president should be impeached and removed from office, Biden has faced warning signs of his own.

MAJORITY BACK TRUMP IMPEACHMENT IN LATEST FOX NEWS POLL

Thirty-six percent questioned in the survey said they found the Trump allegations against Biden extremely or very troubling. That included 34 percent of independents and even 24 percent of Democrats.

Longtime Republican strategist Colin Reed highlighted that “the discussion involving Ukraine is going to involve a continued focus on why Hunter Biden was being paid $50,000 a month to sit on the board of an energy company with him having absolutely no expertise in that area.”

Reed emphasized, “I think that crony capitalism does not sit well with voters in the center, right or left.”

And, Biden’s increased criticism aimed at the president likely will incite further attacks from Trump.

While the former vice president was speaking in New Hampshire, the president took to Twitter to return fire.

“So pathetic to see Sleepy Joe Biden, who with his son, Hunter, and to the detriment of the American Taxpayer, has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars, calling for my impeachment - and I did nothing wrong. Joe’s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!” Trump wrote."

A standout moment of the June 27 Democratic primary debate was that of all the candidates on the stage raising their hands, signifying support for government health care plans including “undocumented” immigrants.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SHOULD GET HEALTH CARE, SAY DEMS IN NIGHT 2 DEBATE

Republicans and the White House have seized on that moment, with President Trump declaring it “the end of the race.”

But with the campaign definitely not over, and a number of frontrunners now backing the policy, more attention is turning to how much it could cost to give millions of illegal immigrants health insurance. On Thursday, the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), a policy group that advocates for lower levels of immigration overall, published a study finding that the cost could be up to $23 billion a year.

While candidates have not necessarily gone into detail about their plans, CIS cites an Atlantic survey that found that Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; and former Housing Secretary Julian Castro would all provide “full benefits” to those in the country illegally.

The CIS study estimated that 4.9 million illegal immigrants have incomes below 400 percent of the poverty line and also do not have insurance -- meaning they have incomes low enough to receive coverage via either Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act -- also known to many, particularly critics, as ObamaCare.

The study estimates that if all income-eligible, uninsured illegal immigrants received subsidies under the ACA, then the cost to insure would be $22.6 billion, but with “likely enrollment” of 46 percent, the total cost would be perhaps $10.4 billion a year. It predicts that the average cost of a subsidized premium would be $4,637.

If a mixed approach of ACA subsidies and Medicaid enrollment were used, the cost would dip to $19.6 billion with 100 percent enrollment, and $10.7 billion assuming “likely enrollment.”

These numbers could change significantly if a more overarching health care overhaul is passed by a future Democratic White House and Congress.

“Numbers aside, the fact that presidential candidates are advocating spending billions of dollars on people who are in the country illegally is significant in its own right,” the report concludes. “It suggests that allowing in large numbers of less-educated workers will inevitably generate significant political pressure to provide them access to social programs.”

Extending health care to illegal immigrants could, however, be only one part of the cost to taxpayers of more generous social policies being pushed by Democrats.

AOC PUSHES NATIONAL RENT CONTROL, WELFARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN LATEST MASSIVE PROPOSAL

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who was an early champion of left-favored policies now finding their way into 2020 Democratic platforms, recently introduced a new package of policies known as the “Just Society.”

Among those bills is “The Embrace Act,” which would allow illegal immigrants to claim the same welfare benefits as U.S. citizens and those in the country legally.

""Notwithstanding any other provision of law ... an individual who is an alien (without regard to the immigration status of that alien) may not be denied any federal public benefit solely on the basis of the individual’s immigration status,” the bill reads.

The bill defines a federal public benefit as: “any grant, contract, loan, professional license or commercial license provided by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States; and ... any retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, post-secondary education, food assistance, unemployment benefit,or any other similar benefit for which payments or assistance are provided to an individual, household, or family eligibility unit by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States.”"

GIULIANI ASSOCIATES NABBED FOR ALLEGED CAMPAIGN CRIMES

WSJ: “Two Soviet-born donors to a pro-Trump fundraising committee who helped Rudy Giuliani’s efforts to investigate Democrat Joe Biden were arrested late Wednesday on criminal charges of violating campaign finance rules, including funneling Russian money into President Trump’s campaign. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two Florida businessmen, have been under investigation by the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan, and are expected to appear in federal court in Virginia later on Thursday, the people said. Both men were born in former Soviet republics. Mr. Giuliani, President Trump’s private lawyer, identified the two men in May as his clients. Both men have donated to Republican campaigns including Mr. Trump’s, and in May 2018 gave $325,000 to the primary pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action… A Justice Department official said [Attorney General William Barr] was supportive of their work on the case, on which he was first briefed shortly after being confirmed as attorney general in February.”



Fox poll: Record support for Trump’s ouster - Fox News: “Just over half of voters want President Trump impeached and removed from office, according to a Fox News Poll released Wednesday. A new high of 51 percent wants Trump impeached and removed from office, another 4 percent want him impeached but not removed, and 40 percent oppose impeachment altogether. In July, 42 percent favored impeachment and removal, while 5 percent said impeach but don’t remove him, and 45 percent opposed impeachment.Since July, support for impeachment increased among voters of all stripes: up 11 points among Democrats, 5 points among Republicans and 3 among independents. Support also went up among some of Trump’s key constituencies, including white evangelical Christians (+5 points), white men without a college degree (+8), and rural whites (+10). Among voters in swing counties (where Hillary Clinton and Trump were within 10 points in 2016), support for impeachment increased to 52 percent, up from 42 percent in July.”



Pence to release transcripts of his Ukraine calls - AP: “Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday he is working with the White House counsel’s office to release transcripts of his own calls with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Pence said records of his two phone conversations would help exonerate President Donald Trump of any wrongdoing. Pence was asked about releasing his transcripts and told reporters, ‘I’d have no objection to that.’ He spoke after an event in Waukee, Iowa, where he addressed supporters about the president’s trade policy. Pence said he ‘never discussed the issue of the Bidens’ with Zelenskiy. And he again defended the president, insisting that a ‘plain reading’ of the rough transcript of Trump’s call with the Ukranian leader shows ‘there was no quid pro quo.’”



Pergram: Trump team’s stonewalling speeds up Democrats’ timetable - Fox News: “Next Tuesday is the deadline for most of the House’s requests. That coincides with the day the House returns to session. [Nancy] Pelosi will take the temperature of her caucus when lawmakers return. But in some respects, Pelosi already knows the temperature. Democrats are seething over the administration failing to meet congressional demands. They think they have a robust case against the president when it comes to obstruction of Congress. Pelosi could grant the administration more time to comply. That would let the issue marinate in public for a bit – and demonstrate that Democrats aren’t hasty to impeach. But after that, the House Judiciary Committee could begin drafting articles of impeachment. Pelosi doesn’t travel roads like this unless she already knows the outcome. She doesn’t lose votes on the floor – especially something of this magnitude.”



Trump’s Syria decision affects GOP backing on impeachment - WaPo: “President Trump’s decision to suddenly withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria has angered evangelical Christian leaders and Republican hawks, cleaving his political coalition at the very moment he is trying to fortify his standing to survive the intensifying impeachment inquiry in Congress. Instead of enjoying uncontested GOP support as he plunges into a constitutional showdown with House Democrats and prepares for a bruising reelection campaign, Trump is now fighting on two fronts within his party. … The past few days have tested the bounds of Trump’s Republican support at an unusually frenzied political crossroads that has brought uncertainty for elected officials. While GOP lawmakers have been skittish about directly engaging the subject at the heart of the impeachment debate — the president’s conduct with his Ukrainian counterpart — many have felt free to loudly condemn Trump’s Syria decision, underscoring the fluidity within GOP ranks.”



The Judge’s Ruling: With Syria, Trump lives up to his campaign promise - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains that President Trump removing U.S. troops from Syria complies with his duty to uphold the Constitution: “Trump ran for office promising to bring the troops home. He may have made the latest decision to do so without adequate warning to his military commanders, but his decision is utterly consistent with his promises, and it is utterly in compliance with the Constitution. Now is the time for Congress -- which is largely angry at the presidential use or nonuse of the military -- to repeal both AUMFs and the War Powers Resolution and reclaim its constitutional power as the sole entity in the federal government able to declare war. Until it does, these profoundly outdated, morally ambivalent and overtly unconstitutional statutes lie in the presidential desk drawer like a loaded gun.” More here.



THE RULEBOOK: CUE ‘I’M JUST A BILL’

“The President of the United States is to have power to return a bill, which shall have passed the two branches of the legislature, for reconsideration; and the bill so returned is to become a law, if, upon that reconsideration, it be approved by two thirds of both houses.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 69



TIME OUT: ‘WHY YOU SHOULD BE EATING MORE CHEDDAR’

WSJ: “For over 150 years cheddar was the most popular cheese in the U.S. It sustained colonists and Civil War soldiers, and was the foundation for the industrial innovation of processed ‘American’ cheese. Only recently was cheddar demoted to second place in overall consumption, usurped by that ubiquitous pizza-topper, mozzarella. Though English in origin, cheddar has been part of the American experience from the very start, and today some of this country’s best cheese makers are turning out better cheddar than ever before. Cheddaring, the stacking of blocks of drained curds to extract more whey, creates a sturdy curd suited to aging. … Commodity cheddar is a publicly traded product whose destiny is frozen food, pre-shredded packs and economy supermarket wedges; specialty cheddar, made on a small scale and sold primarily at cheese counters and gourmet stores, is often preserved in wax or clothbound (wrapped in cotton cloth and rubbed with oil or lard).”

BIDEN TRIES COUNTERPUNCHING

Politico: “After calling for Donald Trump’s impeachment for the first time, Joe Biden experienced something here he rarely sees on the campaign trail: a sustained standing ovation. …[T]he former vice president’s roll-out of a swaggering, fire-breathing approach and full embrace of impeachment signaled a dramatic departure from course — a change in direction necessitated by weeks of Trump’s siege warfare. … It was his most aggressive posture to date, presenting a case that Trump could not be trusted, while positioning himself as the fighter that America needs at this moment to face off against a ‘bully’ and a ‘coward.’ … He also took a veiled shot at Elizabeth Warren, who has overtaken Biden in recent national polls and whose campaign mantra is centered on her dozens of policy plans. … Biden’s shift toward a harsher tone and his evolution on impeachment was born out of circumstance, necessity and personal animus. It came after days of privately huddling with advisers.”



Sanders retracts statement about slowing down campaign - NBC News: “Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday tamped down speculation that he would slow his presidential campaign after he suffered a heart attack last week, saying he plans to compete as vigorously as ever for the 2020 Democratic nomination. The Vermont independent told NBC in an exclusive interview airing Wednesday night on ‘Nightly News’ and Thursday on the ‘Today’ show that his health scare has only strengthened his resolve, despite telling reporters a day earlier he planned to curtail his normally packed schedule. ‘I misspoke the other day. I said a word I should not have said and media drives me a little bit nuts to make a big deal about it,’ Sanders said during the interview alongside his wife, Jane Sanders. … He added, ‘I want to start off slower and build up and build up and build up.’”



Warren refreshes vow against high-dollar fundraisers - Politico: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she will continue to swear off high-dollar campaign fundraisers in the general election if she becomes the Democratic presidential nominee, extending her self-imposed ban on the events beyond the primary and reversing an earlier statement. ‘When Elizabeth is the Democratic nominee for president, she’s not going to change a thing in how she runs her campaign,’ campaign spokeswoman Kristen Orthman said in a statement Tuesday, which Warren later amplified in a Twitter thread. … That broad statement worried some Democrats, as the party’s presidential nominee traditionally has been a big fundraiser for other candidates and Democratic committees. But in a Wednesday statement, Orthman clarified that Warren's pledge would apply only to her presidential campaign, not to raising money for the Democratic Party or other candidates.”



TEAM TRUMP GOING ALL OUT FOR MINNESOTA, YOU BETCHA

NYT: “A Republican presidential candidate has not won the state of Minnesota since Richard M. Nixon’s victory there in 1972. But President Trump has long viewed it as the one that got away. Mr. Trump barely set foot in the state during his 2016 campaign, and his field organization on the ground was nonexistent… This time, the Trump campaign is determined not to let Minnesota go without trying. So on Thursday night, Mr. Trump will arrive in Minneapolis, one of the most Democratic congressional districts in the country, for his first political rally since House Democrats began an impeachment investigation that threatens to engulf his presidency. It is a rare rally for Mr. Trump in a state he did not win in 2016, and takes him to the heart of opposition territory… Meanwhile, Brad Parscale, the president’s campaign manager, is planning to pour tens of millions of dollars into the campaign’s Minnesota operation, compared with the $30,000 the Trump campaign spent on the state last cycle. The campaign already has 20 paid staff members in the state, and expects to expand to 100.”



LOUISIANA GOVERNOR RACE HEATS UP IN CLOSING DAYS

Politico: “The last televised primary debate in Louisiana saw Republicans Ralph Abraham and Eddie Rispone go after [Democratic Gov. John Bel] Edwards — but also each other, as they seek a second-place finish in an uncertain runoff. Rispone took the opportunity to post a question to Abraham, asking why he promised to donate his congressional salary but later stopped doing so, while Abraham criticized Rispone for his past support of Common Core. The two also argued back and forth about each other’s records, with Abraham accusing Rispone of running ‘distasteful’ attack ads, and Rispone calling Abraham’s line of attack on Common Core ‘an outright lie.’ The pair of Republicans did train their fire on Edwards, too. They hit him over the state’s economy and needled him on why he backed Hillary Clinton in 2016 — an attempt to nationalize the race, with President Donald Trump, who’s been tweeting proflicially about the race, planning an election-eve visit to Lake Charles on Friday night.”



McGrath raises $10.7 million in campaign to oust McConnell - WashTimes: “Democrat Amy McGrath raised a record $10.7 million in the last three months for her bit to topple Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the Senate race in Kentucky. Ms. McGrath, a Marine fighter pilot, is the leading Democratic candidate in the race to take on Mr. McConnell, a six-term senator who is immensely unpopular in his home state. The $10.7 million that Ms. McGrath raised in the third quarter came from 299,000 donors with an average individual contribution of $36. ‘Mitch McConnell has never faced an opponent like Amy McGrath. Not only does a new independent poll show the race tied, but more than a quarter-million grassroots donations — from all 120 Kentucky counties — have provided us a record-shattering first quarter of nearly $11 million to take down McConnell and his self-serving special interest allies. Change is coming,’ said McGrath campaign manager Mark Nickolas.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Chris! Woah, woah, woah! Can we please get an emergency podcast to discuss the new Fox News poll that has 51% of Americans supporting impeachment and removal? This seems crazy, yet not entirely surprising!” – Katie Hacker, Evington, Va.



[Ed. note: I don’t know if we can manage that one, Ms. Hacker, but how about a little Bleacher banter? It may be best here to look at our excellent pollsters’ work in context. If you check out FiveThirtyEight’s very helpful averages on the subject, you’ll see that support for impeachment has been on a sharp increase. On the day when the news broke that the President Trump had sought help from the Ukrainian president in getting dirt on the Bidens, opposition to impeachment ran 11 points ahead, 51 percent to 40 percent. That was in mid-September. Today, the average stands at 49 percent in favor of impeachment and 43 percent opposed. Support among Democrats and independents has jumped 10 points or more while Republicans increased a more modest, but still significant, 4 points on average. The takeaway from our poll and every other credible pollster is that the tide has turned decisively against the president. There is still a long way to go here and public opinion on this subject is obviously malleable. But if more than 80 percent of Democrats are already on board, it’s hard to see that number declining much any time soon. That means Team Trump’s urgent work is to convince increasingly skeptical independent voters that the president deserves to remain in office. It won’t be enough to count on the anger of core Republican supporters.]



“I've been following your continued response to readers who stubbornly insist on asking for a crime worthy of impeachment. Your response is that it's not a legal issue but a political issue. As a devotee of the U.S. Constitution, I really think that your reading of the ‘high crimes and misdemeanors’ standard should actually read ‘high crimes, misdemeanors, and anything else the U.S. House of Representatives feels adequate to the occasion’ would be more of a support for your position. But, alas, such language seems to be missing. Or am I reading the wrong U.S. Constitution? Please advise.” – Bill Panagakos, Littleton, Colo.



[Ed. note: It may be helpful here to look at the intent of the Framers in devising the vehicle. Here’s what Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 65 about the purpose of impeachment: “Those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.” The phrase “high crimes and misdemeanors” was a term of art long before the Constitution was drafted. As Hamilton alludes to in the passage above, the “high” in the term refers to the office more so than the offenses. The purpose of impeachment isn’t to prosecute federal officials for crimes, but rather to remove them from office for abusing their powers and breaching the public trust. The Framers were following in the footsteps of British politician and political philosopher, Edmund Burke. In his famous speech in 1786 seeking the impeachment of the governor general of India, Warren Hastings, for self-seeking, tyrannical treatment of the crown’s Indian subjects Burke declared “the principles of honor, the spirit of cavaliers to govern here; not the low principles of jurisprudence only.” Hastings’ scandal and trial were very much on the minds of Americans during the drafting and ratification of the Constitution and Burke’s view – that “principles of honor” were essential to consider – was the mainstream opinion on this side of the Atlantic. This is why the Senate, not the Supreme Court or some bicameral commission, was chosen to sit in judgment. Here’s Hamilton again: “The prosecution of them, for this reason, will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused. In many cases it will connect itself with the pre-existing factions, and will enlist all their animosities, partialities, influence, and interest on one side or on the other; and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties, than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.” Sound familiar? The Senate, then indirectly elected by state legislatures, with its members serving six year terms, was seen as the best home for dispassionate, fair-minded evaluations of the facts at hand without the unpleasant thought of unelected judges removing an elected president. The House, more easily incited to partisan passion and more responsive to the immediate will of the electorate, can prosecute, but the upper chamber runs the show. Whether or not you agree with their assessment, if a majority of the members of the House believe that the president has abused his office for personal gain and should be removed, they would be entirely within the American understanding of an impeachable offense. Just as it would be within that tradition for the Senate to reject their claim if its members so choose. This is how the system is supposed to work. I imagine that Democrats will end up correlating their articles with existing criminal offenses, like the solicitation of campaign help from foreign countries and obstruction, but that’s just window dressing. Appeals to honor and ethics are enough.]



“Re: your report on Trey Gowdy joining Team Trump. Is he betting all his chips on a series of events that would get him a Supreme Court nomination?” – John Lee, Walnut Creek, Calif.



[Ed. note: I wouldn’t get too far ahead of myself on this one. Gowdy’s friend and longtime fellow South Carolina Congressman Mick Mulvaney is the White House chief of staff. Gowdy is arguably the best suited man in America to go up against House Democrats in this matter. He has a strong reputation among Republicans but still enjoys some credibility among his former Democratic colleagues for his successful navigation of efforts by Trump loyalists to torch the FBI. And if anything, running point on a matter this explosively controversial and rankly partisan would diminish, rather than improve, his chances of being picked for the Supreme Court.]



“Chris and Brianna, Please tell me you took editorial liberty in quoting Federalist No. 30 and that Alexander Hamilton did not write in all caps. My image of the esteemed first Secretary of the Treasury will be forever marred if he was a precedent Twitter troll.” – Dan Burch, Turlock, Calif.



[Ed. note: Capitalization is a funny thing. We’ve only really had standard practices for the past century or so. Certainly back in 1787, it was highly irregular across the English-speaking world. If you look at our founding documents you’ll see that in those days, for example, it was conventional to capitalize nouns in the way modern German speakers do. Consider the American creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” As you can see, the capitalization of nouns isn’t even standard. Why “Rights” but not “men?” “Liberty” but not “truths?” What comes through is that capitalization was a form of emphasis, not grammatical rules. The capitalized words after the start of the sentence – “Creator,” “Rights,” “Life,” “Liberty” and “Happiness” – actually make for a kind of semaphore for the actual meaning of the sentence. The essence is there in those five key words. So yes, I’m sorry to break it to you that ALL CAPS was a thing before Twitter. And you can just imagine Hamilton, eyes and pen aflame responding to the opponents of the Constitution: “IN THE USUAL PROGRESS OF THINGS, THE NECESSITIES OF A NATION, IN EVERY STAGE OF ITS EXISTENCE, WILL BE FOUND AT LEAST EQUAL TO ITS RESOURCES.” There’s no record of whether Patrick Henry wrote back “u mad bro?”]

WHAT I LEARNED IN CHICK-FIL-A TRAINING IS…

WBNS: “A Chick-fil-A employee went above and beyond to help a customer having a bad day. Shauna Hall was getting out of her van when she dropped her phone in the parking lot of a Chick-fil-A in Stafford, Virginia. The phone fell into a storm drain. … That’s when Seth, a digital marketing director with Chick-fil-A, said he would help. After cleaning his finger after slicing it trying to remove the manhole cover to the drain, Seth went into the storm drain and retrieved Hall’s phone. It didn’t break in the fall and wasn’t wet. ‘As he was about to climb out of the hole he asked me to snap a picture so he could show his girlfriend what he did at work today,’ Hall said. Seth’s shift had just ended, yet he didn’t hesitate to stay and help a customer in need.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“Behind the [Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial], guarding him, is an arc of short quotations chiseled in granite. This is in keeping with that glorious feature of Washington’s monumental core — the homage to words (rather than images of conquest and glory, as in so many other capitals), as befits a nation founded on an idea.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) Aug. 26, 2011.

* Louisiana will hold its first round of balloting tomorrow in its gubernatorial race, and Donald Trump will visit the state tonight to rally the Republican troops. Incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) is expected to outpace his GOP rivals, and if Edwards tops the 50% threshold tomorrow, there will be no second round of voting next month.

* Speaking of presidential travel, Trump was in Minneapolis last night for an unusually long campaign rally, at which he attacked all kinds of foes, targeting Joe Biden with particular zeal.

* Former Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) was planning a comeback next year, but now that he appears to be “Congressman-1” in the indictment of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman – Rudy Giuliani’s associates who were arrested this week – the Texan’s political future is again in doubt.

* On a related note, many of the Republicans who received contributions from Parnas and Fruman are scrambling to either give the money back or donate it to charity.

* While most national Democratic presidential primary polls show Joe Biden’s lead over Elizabeth Warren disappearing, Fox News’ latest national poll shows the former vice president leading the Massachusetts senator, 32% to 22%. Bernie Sanders is third in the poll with 17%. (Also of interest, Beto O’Rourke reached 3% in the Fox poll, which moves him a little closer to qualifying for the party’s November primary debate.)

* As for the general election, Fox’s poll found Biden and Warren leading Trump by 10 points each, while Sanders leads the president in a hypothetical match-up by nine points.

* Forty-five years ago, Rep. Larry Hogan Sr. (R-Md.) was the first Republican on the House Judiciary Committee to vote to impeach Richard Nixon. Yesterday, his son, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan Jr. (R), announced his support for Congress’ impeachment inquiry into Trump.

* And in a bit of a surprise, House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) announced yesterday that she’ll retire at the end of this Congress. Her district, which Hillary Clinton carried by 20 points, is expected to remain in Democratic hands."

Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, both of whom have called for a crackdown on Wall Street and financial institutions.

Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren asked Belfort to weigh in on the current 2020 Democratic field, as many of the leading candidates have long criticized the financial industry.

""If one of these people gets into office, it will be a Warren or Sanders destruction.” — Jordan Belfort, Wolf of Wall Street

“Wall Street has a really, really important function, right? When Wall Street runs amok, it gets really ugly,"" said Belfort. ""What frightens me about a Bernie Sanders or an Elizabeth Warren is like they think that government is… the answer… but the policies that they're talking about will literally destroy the fabric of the country,” Belfort said.

However, Belfort said that he believed that Trump will emerge with a victory in 2020.

“If I didn't, I wouldn't be able to sleep at night, OK? Because I think that this nation would be literally destroyed,"" he said. ""If one of these people gets into office—a Warren or Sanders—destruction.”

“He's a great salesman,"" Belfort continued, praising the president.

""I wish that he would say things in a way that p*** people off less because it doesn't help… but I can’t judge because he's president. I didn't become president, he did. I went to jail.”

Later in the episode, Belfort opened up about his notorious financial rise, devastating downfall, and how his time in prison helped reinvent his future.

“Of course, I'm remorseful about what happened,"" said Belfort, responding to Lahren, who questioned whether he regretted his past actions.

“I deserved to go to jail,"" Belfort continued. ""I definitely deserved to go to jail, it was a positive experience,” he recalled. “I thought the judge was very smart… he sentenced me to a long enough time to really [make sure]… I'll never forget—that was terrible. Yet not long enough to destroy my life, destroy my children.”

Belfort was portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in the blockbuster Hollywood movie, “The Wolf of Wall Street,” which shed light on his early life and white-collar crimes that led to his eventual time in prison.

After serving 22 months between 2004 and 2006 for securities fraud totaling over $200 million, Belfort was also ordered to return $110 million to investors.

""The judge was very smart… he sentenced me to a long enough time to really [make sure]… I'll never forget that was terrible, Yet not long enough to destroy my life, destroy my children.” — Jordan Belfort, Wolf of Wall Street

Following his time in prison, Belfort worked on his sobriety and began to write his book -- which would serve as a basis for the film. Belfort described becoming sober and writing the book as pivotal experiences in his path to rehabilitation.

“When I wrote the book it was like… self-therapy to look back and examine all your actions… I love the movie—obviously, some things were fictionalized to serve the narrative so to speak… There are some things that bothered me that I thought made me look worse than I was and other things that probably didn't look as bad as I was,” Belfort recalled.

The 2013 film reportedly made an estimated $400 million worldwide and gained Belfort widespread recognition, kicking off his second career as a motivational speaker.

On Friday night's show he seemed to view radio jock Howard Stern as a kindred spirit.

""That's why you and I are the last sane people because we're liberals but we don't go for all the bulls--- on the far left."" — Bill Maher to Howard Stern

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING DEMOCRATIC 2020 DEBATE

Maher also took aim at Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, the foreign-born associates of Rudy Giuliani who were arrested this week on campaign finance charges before allegedly attempting to flee the U.S.

""This is the great irony of the Trump presidency,"" Maher said. ""Foreign criminals must be kept out of the country at all costs, unless they're here to steal our elections.""

On the Trump impeachment inquiry, and Republicans' reluctance to cooperate with Democrat-led House committees, Maher quipped: ""The president of the United States is going to be impeached because he treats subpoenas like parking tickets.""

Maher also made the case that Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders were too ""far left"" to win the general election, and touted Sen. Amy Klobuchar as a ""dark horse"" who could potentially top the party's ticket.

Maher spoke to Klobuchar in a one-on-one interview. He argued that Klobuchar was ""plenty liberal"" but could actually beat President Trump.

""Obviously this is a fight between two wings of the party, which is almost every election. There is a center in the Democrat, a center-left wing. You're plenty liberal. You're plenty progressive,"" Maher told Klobuchar. ""And then there is a far-left which I think would be represented by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.""

Klobuchar would not address Warren and Sanders directly but clearly dismissed their platforms and pushed her center-left agenda.

""I want to win big and if someone is looking to kick one hundred forty nine million Americans off their current health insurance in four years then I'm not your candidate,"" Klobuchar said. ""If you want to use a bunch of hardworking people's money to send rich people's kids to college for free and I'm not your candidate. And just because people say ideas are bold doesn't mean they're bold. They may be bad.""

Maher also slammed former Vice President Joe Biden, saying he may be too old for the presidency, and that Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., wasn't doing well in the polls -- despite the media attention she's received after debate performances.

Klobuchar ripped Trump on his Ukraine phone call before making a case for her candidacy, saying ""she could bring in moderate Republicans"" and ""win big."" She is currently polling at 2 percent in the latest national Fox News Poll.

In an awkward moment, Maher emphasized that Klobuchar being a woman might help her chances as well.

""I'm saying it's a lot easier to be on the center side of things, as Obama was, if you are not a white man,"" Maher tried to clarify. ""If you're a white straight man.""

Klobuchar responded: ""I want to make clear and I am excited to be one of several women in this race. But I'm not just running on that.""

""I think your moment is to come,"" Maher said."

""I'm a little surprised because there has been so much in the press about how Warren is charging,"" he said.

In addition, Fox News contributor Charlie Hurt said Biden continues to nonetheless hold a strong position as a candidate in the ""non-socialist, less insane lane"" of the primary contest.

He projected the Democrats' eventual nominee will come from that side of the party.

He added that she was the ""most disingenuous person in politics ... after Hillary,"" a reference to his father's former opponent, Hillary Clinton.

Harris responded with an apparent attack on his father. ""You wouldn’t know a joke if one raised you,"" she tweeted.

Trump Jr. shot back with a comment on her poll numbers. ""Based on your tanking poll numbers, what’s definitely a joke is your entire campaign Yikes!"" he tweeted.

According to a Fox News poll from Oct. 6-8, Harris grabbed 15 percent of national Democratic primary voters' support, placing her fourth behind former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

Harris saw a bump in polling over the summer after she took Biden to task over his controversial comments about race. But since then, she's seen drops in multiple polls,

Harris recently faced criticism for calling on Twitter to suspend President Trump's account. The senator sent a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, accusing the president of violating the company's terms of service.

""I believe the president's recent tweets rise to the level that Twitter should consider suspending his account,"" she said. ""When this kind of abuse is being spewed from the most powerful office in the United States, the stakes are too high to do nothing."""

Appearing on MSNBC, Sharpton said that Biden had support among black voters in South Carolina but that was based on the fact he served in former President Barack Obama's administration.

""A lot of Biden's support in South Carolina is African-American voters,"" Sharpton said, referring to one of the early primary states. ""But a lot of that is based on -- he was Barack Obama's vice president.""

""If there is an upset in Iowa, or even a close vote, and New Hampshire and it appears that Elizabeth Warren is the one that can beat Donald Trump, a lot of that vote will switch because a lot of the pro-Biden vote or the pro-any of the Democrats votes are based on anti-Trump,"" Sharpton said.

AL SHARPTON BLASTS DEMOCRATS HE CLAIMS DO NOT DO ENOUGH ON RACE ISSUES: 'WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR NEW SLAVE MASTERS'

Sharpton's comments came as polling showed Warren beating Biden in key states before the 2020 Democratic nomination. Polling also continued showing those two dominating the field of potential Democratic candidates.

Together, Biden and Warren have captured the support of more than half of Democratic primary voters, according to the latest Fox News national poll on the 2020 election.

Biden is on top in the race with 32 percent support among primary voters, up 3 points since September. He’s followed by Warren at 22 percent -- up 6 points and a new high for her. Bernie Sanders is at 17 percent, down 1 point since last month.

NANCY PELOSI SAYS TRUMP'S RALLY COMMENTS ABOUT BIDEN 'BEYOND THE PALE,' RIPS SENATE REPUBLICANS' 'COWARDICE' ON IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

The question of recusal was raised by Rep. Thomas Masie, R-Ky., who asked if senators running for president “have a conflict of interest regarding possible impeachment of an opponent.”

House Democrats last month launched an impeachment inquiry into the circumstances surrounding President Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Democrats allege that Trump was using U.S. military aid to push Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s conduct in the country. Trump has said there was no quid pro quo and that he wanted only to root out corruption.

But as the inquiry consumes Washington and the 2020 campaign trail, it is possible the Democrat-controlled House votes to impeach the president in the coming months.

That would then set up an impeachment trial in the Senate, where a host of 2020 candidates -- including Sens. Klobuchar; Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; Kamala Harris, D-Calif.; Cory Booker, D-N.J.; and Michael Bennet, D-Colo.

It raises the question of whether they would benefit if their potential 2020 general election rival were removed from office -- and if so, if they should therefore recuse themselves from any trial.

“Shouldn’t they recuse themselves if it came to the Senate?” Massie asked. “Wouldn’t anyone so positioned against a defendant be barred from serving as a judge or jury in a court of law?”

Booker was asked on Friday if he would ever recuse himself, and he gave a short, simple answer: “No.”

In her answer, Klobuchar went into greater detail.

“I was elected as a U.S. senator for the state of Minnesota and my job will be to be a juror in the case and...I very strongly believe that this impeachment proceeding must go forward,” she said. “I don't know what counts that the House will come up with and what they will bring over to us but my job will be to look at the evidence and make a decision.”

Other senators have not addressed the question directly, but have no given any sign that they would recuse themselves. On Wednesday, Harris sent a letter with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., to every Trump cabinet official demanding they cooperate with ongoing investigations and preserve relevent evidence."

Homelessness in Los Angeles County and across Western states is skyrocketing. In 2019 so far, the number of homeless residents in Los Angeles has risen 12 percent from 2018, according to county statistics.

“We need a FEMA-like, Red Cross-like, National Guard-like [solution],"" said Rev. Andy Bales, the CEO of L.A.’s largest homeless shelter, Union Rescue Mission. ""Army Corps of Engineers needs to come and we need to figure out immediately how to get 44,000 people off the streets.""

Candidate plans that are more forward-looking, like five to 10 years down the road with millions of dollars in investment in affordable housing units, can be good in theory and are necessary, these advocates say, but don’t address “chronic” homelessness, or those who have lived out on the streets for six months or more in the past year.

HOMELESS MAN RANDOMLY PICKS UP 6-YEAR-OLD, SLAMS HIM ON CONCRETE: REPORT

“We’ve been doing $600,000 to $700,000 per person, per unit, and it’s planned over the next 10 years and that will not get it done,” Bales says. He added that only one candidate has reached out to him on how to remedy the situation.

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary under President Obama Julian Castro and Beto O’ Rourke have actually visited homeless encampments on Skid Row, a notoriously expansive homeless encampment in downtown Los Angeles.

O’Rourke released a plan this week similar to Castro’s and Sen. Bernie Sanders’ plans, saying he wants to triple funding for homeless assistance grants through HUD providing $50 billion over the next 10 years, fully funding housing choice vouchers, capping rent increases, and pumping investment in dilapidated public housing units.

But for those who study the issue of homelessness, they say the problem should be coming up more in candidate rhetoric and dialogue as they campaign. It’s not so much to just have a job to maintain housing, they say, because rent prices have become so unsustainable.

“I think it’s becoming an intractable issue because we don’t have the investment and broader solutions to homelessness, which is why I think many of the presidential candidates are focused on affordable housing….it’s still something that’s just emerging and most of the candidates have not yet addressed,"" said Christopher Herring, a UCLA PhD student.

Herring said affordable housing is the main way to go, but there needs to be more steps done to prevent people from becoming homeless in the first place and notes that with Castro and Sanders’ plans, respectively, much of the dollar figures they’re proposing will be spent quickly and frivolously unless backed up by creating and maintaining affordable housing quickly and cost-efficiently.

""To put it another way, that expansion of the billions of dollars for homelessness in Castro and Sanders plans will be pissed away quickly and a waste of taxpayer money if not backed up by more robust structural reform in the production and preservation of affordable housing.""

TOMI LAHREN: CA DEMOCRATS IGNORING HOMELESS 'EPIDEMIC' IN FAVOR OF TRUMP IMPEACHMENT PUSH

California’s Democratic primary will be early in 2020, moving up to March from June, making the state in play again for candidates vying for the nomination with 500 delegates up for grabs.

Voters in the state have homelessness high on their list of issues. Some in Los Angeles county say it even trumps traffic and the environment in what needs to be fixed first in the city.

But ultimately, homeless people have very little, if any political power as a constituency, which could be why voters haven’t heard about the problem in states other than California.

“For the most part, the people who are experiencing homelessness are not voting, at least they’re not voting en masse, they don’t have a strong political voice, they don’t have political champions, and elected officials who are sensitive to what their constituents want or else they’re going to get voted out of office, it’s not a constituency they have to pay a lot of attention to,” said Adam Murray, executive director of LA’s Inner City Law Center.

California senator and presidential candidate Kamala Harris is supporting a bill in the Senate to provide $13 billion in emergency relief to areas affected by chronic homelessness over the next five years. But Republicans are unlikely to bring it up for a vote, citing the huge price tag.

Harris has blamed the Trump administration for cutting off funding to support what local government needs around affordable housing.

President Trump, on the other hand, has spoken about the issue on Twitter and at his rallies numerous times, largely in irreverent tones.

At a rally in Cincinnati in August, he said, ""What they are doing to our beautiful California is a disgrace to our country...It's a shame. The world is looking at it. Look at Los Angeles with the tents and the horrible, horrible conditions. Look at San Francisco, look at some of your other cities.""

Herring says California needs a federal response like what Trump is suggesting, saying, ""Trump has drawn attention to this and it’s woken up the Democratic candidates to putting forward and putting pressure on them to make real solutions.”"

While Biden’s support has stayed between 29-35 percent since March, his current 10-point advantage is about half of his 19-point lead in June. The rundown continues with Kamala Harris at 5 percent, Pete Buttigieg at 4 percent, Beto O’Rourke at 3 percent, and Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang each at 2 percent. Michael Bennet, Julian Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Tim Ryan, Tom Steyer, and Marianne Williamson receive 1 percent apiece.”



Biden’s firewall still strong - WaPo: “[Contrary] to the expectations of analysts, the fears of supporters and the hopes of rivals, Biden maintains a sizable loyal following. Nowhere is that more evident than in the African American community, recent interviews suggest, especially in states like South Carolina, which holds a crucial early primary. Martha Beck, a retired high school teacher from Charleston … gushed about Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) but said Sanders is ‘too old and grumpy and he just shouts at people all the time.’ And she doesn’t think the same country that elected [Donald] Trump would put Warren, or any other woman, in the White House four years later.”



Will any Dem dare mention the swampy stuff? - NYT: “It’s the one question about impeachment that no Democratic presidential candidate wants to answer head on. Should Joe Biden’s son Hunter have been allowed to sit on the board of a foreign company while his father served as vice president? In the past few weeks, Mr. Biden and his campaign team have spent significant amounts of time and energy denouncing any whiff of impropriety between his son’s work and his service as vice president. … So far, none of the Democratic primary candidates have taken a hard swing at Mr. Biden, focusing instead on the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. But a few are, quite delicately, trying to raise some concerns. … In past debates, candidates who have taken on Mr. Biden’s personal characteristics, like his age, have faced blowback. The questions surrounding his son may be even more sensitive… Echoing an attack introduced and continually leveraged — in false ways — by Mr. Trump could risk raising Democrats’ ire.”



Jane Sanders takes starring role in husband’s campaign - NYT: “When it comes time to make critical decisions regarding his presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders often relies on a committee of two: himself and his wife, Jane Sanders. … When doctors confirmed to her on Thursday that Mr. Sanders had suffered a heart attack, she said, it was her decision to wait until he was discharged the next day to release that information. And when it was time to say publicly that Mr. Sanders would be easing the pace of his campaigning after his heart attack, Ms. Sanders … stood beside him to explain the reason: His closest advisers, ‘especially me,’ had told him to slow down. … In a rare interview on Wednesday at their home in Burlington, Ms. Sanders said it would be ‘egotistical’ to call herself Mr. Sanders’s top adviser but allowed that she was ‘very much a close adviser.’ Above all, she said, she was ‘his wife.’”



Voter intensity on both sides through the roof - Gallup: “A year before the 2020 presidential election, roughly seven in 10 Democrats and Republicans say they have given ‘quite a lot of thought’ to the election. About half of political independents have done so. The lack of a Republican-Democratic difference in thought given to the election is notable because Republicans usually have an advantage over Democrats, including in each of the past seven final presidential pre-election surveys, as well as in most surveys conducted throughout presidential election years historically. The current results are based on combined data from interviews with more than 2,400 U.S. adults aged 18 and older, conducted between Aug. 15 and Sept. 30, 2019. Gallup has measured thought given to the election since 1952, and it has shown a relationship to actual voter turnout among all Americans in past elections.”

“It seldom happens in the negotiation of treaties, of whatever nature, but that perfect SECRECY and immediate DESPATCH are sometimes requisite.

TIME OUT: ‘A STATUE OF FLORENTINE BRONZE’

Paris Review: “In the late summer of 1866, a black equestrian stuntwoman made her Paris debut and galvanized the city. She was known only as ‘Sarah the African,’ and history has left us few traces of her: just some battered posters, inky clippings, and burlesque scripts. Sarah was, in the words of the men who wrote about her, ‘the finest horsewoman of the King of Morocco,’ ‘an Ethiopian,’ or ‘a statue of Florentine bronze.’ A ‘negress’ who performed as neither slave nor clown, whose name evoked Sarah Baartman, the Khoikhoi woman dissected by Georges Cuvier just a few decades before in Paris, and Selika, the queen heroine of Meyerbeer’s hit posthumous opera, L’Africaine. She was a woman named for a whole continent. … On her debut in September she was billed above Méphistophélès the bareback horse, above a race of forty horses all mounted by women, above the rubber horseman, William Meyer, and even above Mlle Adèle, who made her Sidy-Laraby dance with no reins.”

GIULIANI’S WOES MOUNT

ABC News: “The business relationship between President Donald Trump's private lawyer Rudy Giuliani and the men charged Thursday in a campaign finance scheme is a subject of the ongoing criminal investigation being conducted by federal authorities in New York, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The investigation became public after the FBI had to quickly move to arrest Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman before they boarded a flight out of the country from Washington Dulles Airport with one-way tickets. They have been named as witnesses in the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Trump. The investigation is being conducted by the FBI's New York field office and prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, the same U.S. Attorney's office Giuliani ran before he became mayor of New York.”



Former Ambassador to Ukraine cites Giuliani pressure campaign - AP: “Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told lawmakers Friday that President Donald Trump pressured the State Department to oust her from her position. Yovanovitch said in an opening statement obtained by The Associated Press that she was ‘abruptly’ recalled in May and told the president had lost confidence in her. She said she was told by an official that there was a ‘concerted campaign against me’ and that Trump had pressured officials to remove her for almost a year. ‘Although I understand that I served at the pleasure of the president, I was nevertheless incredulous that the U.S. government chose to remove an ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives,’ Yovanovitch wrote in the statement.”



Report: Trump pushed Tillerson to help a Giuliani client - WaPo: “President Trump sought to enlist then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in the fall of 2017 to work with Rudolph W. Giuliani to help stop the prosecution of a Turkish Iranian gold trader represented by the former New York mayor, according to people with knowledge of the request. Trump urged Tillerson in an Oval Office meeting to try to craft a diplomatic ‘deal’ to stop the U.S. case against Reza Zarrab on corruption charges in exchange for concessions from Turkey. The request shocked the then-secretary of state, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations involving the president. At the time, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was personally lobbying Trump to get the charges dropped. Trump, in turn, repeatedly raised the topic with Tillerson — including directly in the Oval Office meeting, according to people with knowledge of the episode.”



Pete Session’s political revival threatened by Ukraine role - NYT: “Former Representative Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican who is seeking a return to Congress, was caught in the fallout of the Ukraine scandal on Thursday when he was referred to in the indictment of two presidential allies accused of campaign finance allegations. Mr. Sessions, who served 11 terms in Congress until he was swept out last year, is described as ‘Congressman-1’ in the indictment of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were arrested and charged on Thursday with illegally funneling foreign money to American political candidates and campaigns. The two men are associates of Rudolph W. Giuliani… Mr. Sessions’s appearance in the indictment, which was filed just a week after he announced he would run for Congress in 2020, was an early and potentially damaging blow to his campaign. Mr. Sessions is not named in the indictment, nor is he accused of any wrongdoing. On Thursday, he issued a statement that denied any wrongdoing and said he had no knowledge of the scheme detailed by federal prosecutors.”



Continetti: We are all Ukrainians - Free Beacon: “From Varsity Blues to Jeffrey Epstein, from China and the NBA to Ukraine and Hunter Biden, Americans are taking a crash course on the ways in which powerful people manipulate the system for personal advantage and globalization merges political cultures as well as economies. What has been uncovered as impeachment rolls on does nothing to spur confidence in the integrity of our system. America is exceptional, but our elites are not. Today we are all Ukrainians.”



TRUMP LEGAL TEAM TRASHES GOWDY

Yahoo: “The president’s decision to bulk up his legal team with former South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy amid a widening impeachment inquiry is drawing criticism from one of his high-profile supporters. On Wednesday morning, the day after news leaked that Gowdy was set to serve as outside counsel to the president, Victoria Toensing, a veteran Washington lawyer who has been working with Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, expressed concern and disbelief that the onetime advocate for congressional oversight would be coming onboard. ‘Trey Gowdy doesn’t know s***,’ she said. … ‘He screwed up the Benghazi hearings, and he came out with the advice to Trump, ‘Well, if you’ve done nothing wrong, just talk to Bob Mueller.’’ Toensing and her husband, Joe diGenova, work with Giuliani though they are not officially on Trump’s legal team.”



And he can’t even join until January - WashEx: “Former Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy cannot join President Trump's legal team until early next year, the president announced Thursday. Speaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump said, ‘Trey Gowdy is a terrific guy. I think there’s a problem with, he can’t start for another couple of months because of lobbying rules and regulations.’ It was only a day after Jay Sekulow, counsel to the president, announced Gowdy had joined the team to assist with the response to the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry. … Gowdy, 55, is a former federal prosecutor who retired from Congress on Jan. 3 after representing the 4th Congressional District of South Carolina for four terms. He then rejoined his old white-collar law firm, Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough. Despite his return to the legal profession, federal law prevents Gowdy from taking on Trump as a client in the impeachment fight until Jan. 3, 2020.”



DEMS DIVIDED ON TIMING OF IMPEACHMENT VOTE

Politico: “House Democrats are grappling with whether to take more steps to formalize their impeachment inquiry and silence a chief Republican criticism of their efforts, with competing factions beginning to emerge. President Donald Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill have hammered Speaker Nancy Pelosi for not holding a vote authorizing the House’s impeachment proceedings — arguing that without a vote, the entire process is illegitimate. Pelosi has refused to cave, dismissing Trump’s demand last week and insisting it is not required under the Constitution or House rules. And allies close to the speaker say her position hasn’t changed, describing the idea as the latest ‘Republican canard’ in a series of stall tactics the GOP will employ to protect Trump. … Yet some Democratic lawmakers and aides have begun to say privately — and, to a lesser extent, publicly — that the House should just vote to formalize the inquiry, robbing the GOP of its main talking point. The debate is threatening to cleave Democrats’ unified front as the White House makes the arcane procedural arguments the centerpiece of its impeachment defense.”



House members get an earful from voters back home - Politico: “The ‘Make America Great Again’ hats were in the front row Thursday night at freshman Rep. Anthony Brindisi’s first town hall event since Speaker Nancy Pelosi blessed an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. But for all the criticism the centrist Democrat faced from pro-Trump voters, the sharper questions came from his own supporters about why he is one of just seven in his caucus who has refused to endorse the impeachment push. … Swing-district Democrats doggedly avoided the impeachment debate when they first got to Washington. Now they can’t avoid it. … But at dozens of town halls over the two-week recess, Brindisi and other vulnerable freshmen had to fend for themselves — serving as the party’s on-the-ground voices on impeachment. Whether they can deliver a message that resonates could determine Democrats’ chances of winning over the public and holding on to their seats and the House majority in 2020.”



Independents’ support for impeachment jumps 10 points - NPR: “A slim majority of Americans now approve of the Democratic House-led impeachment inquiry into President Trump, a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds. Fifty-two percent say they approve of the inquiry, while 43% disapprove. That's a slight increase in support from two weeks ago, when 49% approved and 46% disapproved. The numbers are in line with other polls that have been released this week also showing majority support or an increase in support for the inquiry. The uptick in support in the NPR poll comes mostly from a swing among independents. In late September, more independents disapproved of the inquiry than approved, by a 50-44% margin. Now, in a reversal, more independents approve of the inquiry than disapprove, by a 54-41% margin, a net change of 19 points. On the questions of whether Trump should be impeached or removed from office, Americans are split — 49-47% in favor of impeachment and 48-48% on whether the Senate should vote to remove him.”



ROMNEY STEPS UP HIS ROLE FOR GOP

Politico: “President Donald Trump wants to sideline Mitt Romney — but the Utah senator isn’t having it. Even as he faces a barrage of attacks from the president and his allies, Romney is mapping out plans to play a central role in 2020 — headlining party events, shelling out cash from his campaign war chest, and hitting up his donor network for vulnerable senators on the ballot next year.Later this month, Romney will take his most aggressive step yet to insert himself into the 2020 campaign when he hosts a New York City fundraiser for Maine Sen. Susan Collins, Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner and Michigan Senate hopeful John James. All are establishment-aligned figures confronting tough races in swing states. Behind the scenes, Romney’s team has also begun directing his donors to help GOP candidates in Senate battlegrounds. Romney aides say he's always intended to help in competitive Senate races and that his desire to do so has never been influenced by Trump’s efforts to ostracize him.”



Dems eye Chelsea Clinton for New York House seat - NYT: “Ms. [Nita] Lowey’s announcement set off a wave of speculation about other potential contenders, including Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, as well as a state assemblyman, David Buchwald. Last year, when asked if she envisioned running for elected office, Chelsea Clinton told The Journal News, which covers the Hudson Valley, that ‘if someone were to step down or retire,’ she would ‘have to think if it’s the right choice for me.’ Ms. Clinton did not mention any particular office, although she is clearly familiar with Ms. Lowey’s district: Her parents’ house in Chappaqua, N.Y., is in the district. Ms. Clinton herself does not live in Westchester, but congressional candidates are not required to live in the district they represent. A representative for Ms. Clinton did not return a request for comment. Mr. Buchwald said he would make an announcement within a few days.”



Ocasio-Cortez draws credible primary challenger - Fox News: “A prominent New York City Democrat filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) Thursday to launch a primary challenge for the House of Representatives seat currently held by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y. City Council member Fernando Cabrera said he believes a moderate Democrat such as himself could beat the socialist Ocasio-Cortez. He plans to target her far-left views and highlight his belief that she is a ‘no show’ in the district. ‘Only a Democrat is going to be able to defeat her, and it’s going to be a moderate Democrat,’ Cabrera, who represents a Bronx City Council district, told Politico. ‘She’s a no-show in the district. She hasn’t brought about anything except division within the party.’ ‘Socialism doesn’t work,’ Cabrera added.”



Pompeo ally steps aside in Kansas Senate race - The Wichita [Kan.] Eagle: “A Kansas business leader with longtime ties to Mike Pompeo will not run for U.S. Senate after weighing a bid for months — renewing speculation about whether the secretary of state will enter the race. Alan Cobb, the president and CEO of the Kansas Chamber of Commerce, in the past has said he would defer to Pompeo if the chief diplomat decided to mount a campaign. Cobb, a former Koch Industries lobbyist, advised Pompeo in 2014 during a congressional primary battle against former Rep. Todd Tiahrt. He made no mention of Pompeo in a lengthy statement Thursday announcing his decision. Cobb said that ‘after months of serious deliberation, analysis, and careful and prayerful consideration with friends, colleagues and my family, I have decided that the best place for me to pursue my passion is to remain as the President and CEO of the Kansas Chamber.’”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I need your help. I don’t get what is going on with the Syria/Turkey situation. I understand the following: Trump has proclaimed that he is pulling troops from Syria after what has been a long involvement (partnering) with the Kurds. But, that doesn’t happen overnight, right? Once Trump announced the pulling of troops, Turkey is waiting on the sideline frothing at the chance to attack. They then attack, even with threats from Trump that they better not or there will once again be sanctions. Now the number of Kurds killed are rolling in, but are our troops still there? If they are, what are they doing? Is there something that Trump picked up on that is going on with the Kurds? The conspiracist side of me thinks he sniffed something out. My husband is an Iowa farmer and I work in crop insurance. We don’t have many ties to the military but sure understand how government a lot of the time just doesn’t make sense. Any insight would be appreciated.” – E’Lise Bracker, Underwood, Iowa



[Ed. note: No conspiracy here, Ms. Bracker. The number of U.S. troops in the disputed area was very small – measured in dozens. They were not a credible threat in terms of actually combating Turkey’s forces but rather something of a marker. By having the troops there, we were telling the Turks to stay out and leave our Kurdish allies alone. It was a small-scale version of the U.S. forces in South Korea: To fight, the Turks would have had to kill Americans, thereby bring our military down on their heads. Upon the president’s order, the U.S. troops were quickly out of the Turks’ zone of aggression. The Americans went to Iraq and other U.S. spots in the region, clearing the way for the Turks to start pummeling their ancient Kurdish enemies.]



“I am a huge fan of the Halftime Report and never miss it! Your struggle to remain fairly balanced is appreciated, especially by this reader who also struggles mightily to find truth and facts amid the bias and innuendo currently being passed off as ‘news.’ But I am confused by most of the polls' questions (especially the polls you quote) that seem to ask a compound question: Do you favor impeachment and removal of President Trump? I was under the impression that these are two distinct question. That impeachment is like a grand jury investigation, i.e. a procedure (in the House) designed to decide whether there are grounds for a trial (by the Senate) to decide if removal is warranted or not. Am I wrong? Please explain! And keep up the good work!!!” – Tom Scherer, Udon Thani, Thailand



[Ed. note: This is an excellent question, Mr. Scherer! Different pollsters do indeed ask these questions in different ways. The complexity of the situation is partly to blame. An “impeachment inquiry” is not a thing. It’s like a couple being “pre-engaged.” But some pollsters have been asking about it, which tends to screw things up. Getting respondents to differentiate between an “impeachment inquiry” and “impeachment” is quite a lot of hair-splitting for civilians. Our poll does it the right way (obvi) and asks whether voters support impeachment, impeachment and removal or no impeachment. Those are the three constitutional possibilities. In our poll, 4 percent of respondents said they wanted the president impeached but not removed. That adds up to 55 percent favoring impeachment and 51 percent favoring removal.]



“All my teams have long gone home for the winter. So now we have your traditional Nine in the form of the quite surprising Cardinals playing your hometown Nationals (who should be the Senators and in the American League with Walter Johnson throwing flames, but oh, well). Where do your loyalties lie?” – Mary Carol Miller, Greenwood, Miss.



[Ed. note: Hometown!? Washington, D.C.!? My place of residence, certainly. And I do love living here. But c’mon, Doc! My hometown is Wheeling, W.Va. and the Cardinals, whose order I lustily joined as a boy when my family moved to St. Louis for four years, are my baseball team. I admire the Nats’ pluck and am grateful for the chance they are affording me to watch the National League Championship Series in person. But I love the Cardinals and am absolutely over the moon with this year’s squad. What a bunch! The infield alone may be the greatest since my glory days of fandom in the mid-1980s. Matt Carpenter is an absolute rock for the team and the personification of professionalism, Paul DeJong is a clutch player (whoever heard of a slugger shortstop?) who seems like he was born to be a Cardinal, Kolten Wong surfs second base like the pros ride waves at Honoli’i in his hometown and Paul Goldschmidt has shown in his tenacity, play and quality of his character that he is truly in the right uniform. And Yadi is nothing less than a national treasure. So suffice it to say: Viva el Birdos!]



“How ‘bout them Redbirds! We miss you on Twitter where we could delight in the pure joy emanating from Cardinals gifs, memes, and tweets after a playoff series win…but the mailbag will have to do!” – Jack Whiteman, St. Louis

‘THIS IS A NUDGE TO PICK UP THE FUDGE’

AP: “Officials in a southwest Missouri city are planting small flags in piles of abandoned dog poop as part of a campaign to get residents to clean up after their pets downtown. The Police Department in Springfield, Mo., posted photos of the flags in use on its Facebook page Wednesday. The flags contain messages such as, ‘Is this your turd? ‘Cuz that's absurd’ and ‘This is a nudge to pick up the fudge.’ The campaign started this week and the department noted on Facebook that leaving behind a pet's mess in many cases violates a city ordinance. The city's Environmental Services said the flags are made of bamboo and recycled paper and downtown crews will pick them up if they have to clean up pet waste.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“The whole debate arouses dismay, and not just because of the overreaching claims of both sides. One has an instinctive feeling that religion has a place in American public life, and that both sides misunderstand it—that between sectarianism and secularism lies something else.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the New Republic on April 9, 1984.

240,Paul Steinhauser,"MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Two long-shot candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination who failed to make next week’s debate stage are taking aim at the showdowns.

What I hear from folks time and time again is nothing … [+4076 chars]",Two long-shot candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination who failed to make next week’s debate stage are taking aim at the showdowns.,2019-10-11,Fox News,"Bullock, long-shot 2020 Dem, insists nomination ‘won’t be decided by the debates’",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lower-tier-2020-dems-argue-nomination-wont-be-decided-by-the-debates,"MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Two long-shot candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination who failed to make next week’s debate stage are taking aim at the showdowns.

“This won’t be decided by the debates. What I hear from folks time and time again is nothing meaningful came out of these debates and they’re often disconnected from peoples’ lives,” Montana Gov. Steve Bullock said Friday.

Bullock spoke with reporters from Fox News, NBC News, and NPR after headlining the ""Politics and Eggs"" speaking series, a must-stop for White House hopefuls in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire.

BULLOCK ACCUSES STEYER OF BUYING HIS WAY ONTO DEBATE STAGE

Bullock, who launched his campaign in the late spring, qualified for the second round of debates but didn’t reach the Democratic National Committee’s polling and fundraising criteria to make the cut for last month’s showdown or Tuesday’s debate, which will be held in Ohio.

The DNC’s raising the thresholds again for candidates to make the stage for November’s fifth round showdown, which will be held in Atlanta.

Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet is in a similar situation. He jumped into the race relatively late and qualified for the first two rounds of debates, but didn’t make the stage last month and won’t be in the debate spotlight next week.

“I had to make a decision on the debate stage, whether I was going to keep laundering money through Facebook to try to stay on a debate stage that was pre-season football, that wasn’t going to make a difference in the standings, or whether I was going to talk to voters directly in Iowa and New Hampshire,” Bennet explained in an interview on Tuesday with Fox News and NHTalkRadio.com.

“I decided I was going to talk to voters directly in Iowa and New Hampshire at a time when they were going to start paying attention to this race,” he emphasized.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Twelve candidates have qualified for Tuesday’s showdown. Bullock, Bennet, and four other contenders in the still extremely large but shrinking field of Democratic White House hopefuls failed to make the cut.

Most of the lower-tier candidates have fired away for months at the DNC for their debate criteria, arguing it’s unfair and winnows the field of candidates before voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina – the first four states in the primary and caucus presidential nominating calendar, get to cast their ballots.

A slightly more diplomatic Bullock said on Thursday that “the DNC was well-intentioned but I don’t think the best example is for campaigns to be spending $50 or $60 to get each individual donor…. I don’t think that’s the best way to pick a candidate or nominee.”

Pushing back against the criticism, DNC Chair Tom Perez told Fox News last month that the process has been “eminently fair” and added “we’re going “to continue to be transparent.”

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard - who failed to qualify for last month’s debate but made the stage for next week’s showdown - announced on Thursday that she may boycott next Tuesday’s debate.

GABBARD THREATENS TO BOYCOTT DEBATE TO PROTEST DNC

The congresswoman from Hawaii accused the DNC and its national media debate partners of “rigging” the primary battle against many of the lower-tier candidates and political outsiders running for the nomination.

“I am seriously considering boycotting October 15 debate to bring attention to DNC/corporate media’s effort to rig 2020 primary,” she tweeted.

Even though he’s not making the stage, Bullock says he’s marching on. He told Fox News he has enough campaign cash to survive until the first votes in the early voting states in February.

“We’re still 120 days out from any voter expressing preference. I still think there’s a lot of time for this,” he stressed.

And Bennet took aim at the top-tier contenders for the nomination, such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

“I think the support for the leaders in the race is very, very soft, maybe as soft as it’s ever been at this stage of the race,” he predicted."

While the president has been front-and-center in the Ukraine controversy that sparked House Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump, Biden’s another key player, and with the impeachment push overshadowing the 2020 White House race, the Democrat has grabbed outsized attention over his rivals for the presidential nomination.

BIDEN, WARREN, GAIN GROUND IN NEW FOX NEWS POLL

It’s a double-edged sword for the former vice president, with Trump’s allegations against Biden’s own Ukraine connection also in the spotlight.

Biden on Wednesday launched a forceful attack on the president – coming from a candidate who in recent weeks was anything but aggressive in calling for Trump’s impeachment, unlike most of his 2020 rivals.

“We all laughed when he said he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it. It’s no joke,” Biden emphasized during two speeches in New Hampshire. “He’s shooting holes in the Constitution, and we cannot let him get away with it.”

Biden’s announcement came one day after the White House vowed not to play ball with the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, but it also came as the former vice president lost his polling status as the unrivaled front-runner. Biden’s neck-and-neck with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for the top spot in most of the recent national and early-voting-state surveys, although he held a lead in the latest Fox News Poll.

FOR FIRST TIME, BIDEN CALLS FOR TRUMP IMPEACHMENT

And, Biden was left in the dust in the race for campaign cash, with both Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont each topping him by roughly $10 million in the July-September third quarter of fundraising.

With those setbacks in mind, the unveiling of the more aggressive, in-your-face approach by Biden has been seen as considerably timely.

“It gets his sea legs under him,” noted Larry Rasky, a longtime Biden friend, adviser and fundraiser. “It gives everybody more energy.”

Rasky, who’s not directly involved in Biden’s 2020 campaign, predicted, “it’s definitely going to help fundraising.”

He added that donors “are happy to see Biden taking on the fight with intensity.”

Biden, in his speeches, taunted the president, claiming “he’s afraid of just how badly I will beat him next November.”

Veteran Democratic consultant and communications strategist Lynda Tran noted that such swagger would resonate with voters. She also said the Ukraine controversy put the spotlight on foreign relations, a wheelhouse for the former vice president.

“His remarks yesterday came across as an ‘enough is enough’ call to action and reminder to the American electorate of the fighter and statesman they have long known,” said Tran, who ran communications for the Obama-era grassroots group Organizing for America and was a founding partner of the communications firm 270 Strategies.

The impeachment inquiry was sparked by Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter over their dealings in the eastern European country. Fueled by whistleblower complaints and a transcript of the call released by the White House, Democrats argued the president was asking a foreign country to interfere in a U.S. election.

Adding to the controversy was the fact that before that phone call, millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine was put on hold. Despite allegations that Trump was using that money as leverage, Trump has insisted repeatedly that he did nothing wrong. He said there was no ""quid pro quo"" and on numerous occasions has described his conversation with the Ukrainian leader as “perfect.”

BIDEN CAMPAIGN SLAMS NY TIMES FOR OP-ED ON FORMER VP'S UKRAINE TIES

The president and allies instead have tried to put the spotlight on Biden and his son.

Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – who had faced widespread accusations of overlooking corruption in his own office – later was dismissed.

Biden, defending his actions in Ukraine, said, “there’s no truth to [Trump's] charges and attacks against me and my son. Zero.”

Biden also accused the president of throwing “lies and distortions and smears” at him and his son, “because he thinks he’ll undermine my candidacy for the nomination as well as the presidency if I am the nominee.”

While the Fox News national poll released Wednesday indicated that a majority said the president should be impeached and removed from office, Biden has faced warning signs of his own.

MAJORITY BACK TRUMP IMPEACHMENT IN LATEST FOX NEWS POLL

Thirty-six percent questioned in the survey said they found the Trump allegations against Biden extremely or very troubling. That included 34 percent of independents and even 24 percent of Democrats.

Longtime Republican strategist Colin Reed highlighted that “the discussion involving Ukraine is going to involve a continued focus on why Hunter Biden was being paid $50,000 a month to sit on the board of an energy company with him having absolutely no expertise in that area.”

Reed emphasized, “I think that crony capitalism does not sit well with voters in the center, right or left.”

And, Biden’s increased criticism aimed at the president likely will incite further attacks from Trump.

While the former vice president was speaking in New Hampshire, the president took to Twitter to return fire.

“So pathetic to see Sleepy Joe Biden, who with his son, Hunter, and to the detriment of the American Taxpayer, has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars, calling for my impeachment - and I did nothing wrong. Joe’s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!” Trump wrote."

The Riverside County Sheriff's Department said they were working to identify the victim. The second person who died in the so-called Sandalwood Fire has been identified as 89-year-old Lois Arvikson. Her son Don Turner said she had called him to say she was evacuating, but he never heard from her again.

The blaze broke out mid-afternoon Thursday when the driver of a commercial trash truck dumped a smoldering load to prevent the vehicle from catching fire. Dry grass quickly ignited and winds gusting to 50 mph blew the fire into the Villa Calimesa Mobile Home Park.

As of Saturday morning, fire officials said the Sandalwood blaze had burned 823 acres and was 25 percent contained. The Saddleridge Fire, in the city's San Fernando Valley area, had burned 7,552 acres and was 19 percent contained.

One man who tried to fight the Saddleridge blaze died of a heart attack, and one firefighter reported a minor eye injury. The fire's cause is under investigation, and authorities warned that the threat of flare-ups remained.

On Saturday afternoon, evacuation orders were lifted in all of Los Angeles County and in parts of Riverside County. Shortly before 5 p.m., the Los Angeles Police Department said in a tweet: ""We thank members of the community for promptly heeding the evacuation orders and their patience as we worked to contain the fire.""

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti urged residents to be cautious returning home to neighborhoods where fire crews could still be operating.

Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said the bulk of the fire at the city's edge had moved away from homes and into rugged hillsides and canyons where firefighters were making steady progress slowing its advance. Television footage showed plumes of smoke rising from the area but no walls of towering flame, as a water-dropping helicopter moved in to dump another cascade on the blaze.

Firefighters worked under sunny skies, but air quality was poor as smoke dispersed over much of greater Los Angeles. Air quality officials urged people to limit outdoor activities.

The forecast called for low humidity — in the 10 percent range — with light wind and an occasional gust up to 15 mph.

Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a state of emergency Friday at 5 p.m. local time for Los Angeles, Riverside and Ventura counties due to the effects of several fires, including the Saddleridge, Eagle, Sandalwood, Reche, and Wolf fires. The Los Angeles Fire Department said Friday evening the fire was only 13 percent contained. The blaze first erupted around 9 p.m. Thursday along the northern tier of the San Fernando Valley. Notoriously high Santa Ana winds pushed the fire westward through dry brush in hilly subdivisions on the outskirts of Los Angeles.

Robert Delgado, who lives in Sylmar, Calif., said he saw flames under a high-voltage electrical transmission tower near his home at around the time the fire broke out.

""We had just finished praying the Rosary, like we do every night,"" when his wife looked out a window and saw fire at the bottom of the tower, Delgado told KABC-TV.

""We immediately ran downstairs, went to the backyard, pulled out the hoses,"" he said, but the wind-whipped flames moved with terrifying speed.

L.A. police Chief Michel Moore said mandatory evacuations in the area have encompassed about 100,000 people in over 20,000 homes. Fire officials said at least 31 structures have been destroyed in the Saddleridge Fire. A middle-aged man who was near the fire went into cardiac arrest and died after apparently trying to fight the fire himself, authorities said.

Moore added that about 450 police were deployed in the area to prevent looting. Police officials allowed some residents to return to their homes for five minute visits Friday to recover important documents, small pets and other valuable before being escorted back to overcrowded shelters.

""It's not the fire itself but the danger of wind taking an ember, blowing it someplace, and seeing entire neighborhoods overnight get lit,"" Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Friday.

FEMA also accepted Newsom's request for a grant Friday to help local fire officials access resources.

“We are closely monitoring the fires burning across the state and are assisting state and local officials helping the tens of thousands of Californians affected by these fires,” Newsom said in a statement. “California thanks the White House for their timely response to our request, which will ensure the communities grappling with this fire have the vital resources and support they need.”

A local reporter tweeted video early Saturday showing the Saddleridge Fire still burning alongside the highway in Santa Clarita.

Los Angeles Fire Chief Ralph M. Terrazas said he flew over the fire Friday and saw ""hundreds, if not thousands of homes"" with charred backyards where firefighters had just managed to halt the flames.

Power was restored for nearly 2 million people Friday. Noting high wind conditions, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. switched off electricity Wednesday in an effort to prevent a repeat of the past two years when its power lines were blown into trees, sparking deadly and destructive wildfires outside the nation’s second-largest city.

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING DEMOCRATIC 2020 DEBATE

Maher also took aim at Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, the foreign-born associates of Rudy Giuliani who were arrested this week on campaign finance charges before allegedly attempting to flee the U.S.

""This is the great irony of the Trump presidency,"" Maher said. ""Foreign criminals must be kept out of the country at all costs, unless they're here to steal our elections.""

On the Trump impeachment inquiry, and Republicans' reluctance to cooperate with Democrat-led House committees, Maher quipped: ""The president of the United States is going to be impeached because he treats subpoenas like parking tickets.""

Maher also made the case that Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders were too ""far left"" to win the general election, and touted Sen. Amy Klobuchar as a ""dark horse"" who could potentially top the party's ticket.

Maher spoke to Klobuchar in a one-on-one interview. He argued that Klobuchar was ""plenty liberal"" but could actually beat President Trump.

""Obviously this is a fight between two wings of the party, which is almost every election. There is a center in the Democrat, a center-left wing. You're plenty liberal. You're plenty progressive,"" Maher told Klobuchar. ""And then there is a far-left which I think would be represented by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.""

Klobuchar would not address Warren and Sanders directly but clearly dismissed their platforms and pushed her center-left agenda.

""I want to win big and if someone is looking to kick one hundred forty nine million Americans off their current health insurance in four years then I'm not your candidate,"" Klobuchar said. ""If you want to use a bunch of hardworking people's money to send rich people's kids to college for free and I'm not your candidate. And just because people say ideas are bold doesn't mean they're bold. They may be bad.""

Maher also slammed former Vice President Joe Biden, saying he may be too old for the presidency, and that Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., wasn't doing well in the polls -- despite the media attention she's received after debate performances.

Klobuchar ripped Trump on his Ukraine phone call before making a case for her candidacy, saying ""she could bring in moderate Republicans"" and ""win big."" She is currently polling at 2 percent in the latest national Fox News Poll.

In an awkward moment, Maher emphasized that Klobuchar being a woman might help her chances as well.

""I'm saying it's a lot easier to be on the center side of things, as Obama was, if you are not a white man,"" Maher tried to clarify. ""If you're a white straight man.""

NANCY PELOSI SAYS TRUMP'S RALLY COMMENTS ABOUT BIDEN 'BEYOND THE PALE,' RIPS SENATE REPUBLICANS' 'COWARDICE' ON IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

The question of recusal was raised by Rep. Thomas Masie, R-Ky., who asked if senators running for president “have a conflict of interest regarding possible impeachment of an opponent.”

House Democrats last month launched an impeachment inquiry into the circumstances surrounding President Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Democrats allege that Trump was using U.S. military aid to push Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s conduct in the country. Trump has said there was no quid pro quo and that he wanted only to root out corruption.

But as the inquiry consumes Washington and the 2020 campaign trail, it is possible the Democrat-controlled House votes to impeach the president in the coming months.

That would then set up an impeachment trial in the Senate, where a host of 2020 candidates -- including Sens. Klobuchar; Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; Kamala Harris, D-Calif.; Cory Booker, D-N.J.; and Michael Bennet, D-Colo.

It raises the question of whether they would benefit if their potential 2020 general election rival were removed from office -- and if so, if they should therefore recuse themselves from any trial.

“Shouldn’t they recuse themselves if it came to the Senate?” Massie asked. “Wouldn’t anyone so positioned against a defendant be barred from serving as a judge or jury in a court of law?”

Booker was asked on Friday if he would ever recuse himself, and he gave a short, simple answer: “No.”

In her answer, Klobuchar went into greater detail.

“I was elected as a U.S. senator for the state of Minnesota and my job will be to be a juror in the case and...I very strongly believe that this impeachment proceeding must go forward,” she said. “I don't know what counts that the House will come up with and what they will bring over to us but my job will be to look at the evidence and make a decision.”

Other senators have not addressed the question directly, but have no given any sign that they would recuse themselves. On Wednesday, Harris sent a letter with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., to every Trump cabinet official demanding they cooperate with ongoing investigations and preserve relevent evidence."

Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law the new piece of legislation, which bans the process in which institutions deny students a meal of their choice due to unpaid fees.

He said students who are given these cheaper ""alternative"" lunches cause them to stick out from their peers.

Newsom said he was inspired by the story of Ryan Kyote, a 9-year-old boy from West Park Elementary who drew attention to how kids at his school were singled out because they didn't have enough money in their food accounts.

Kyote used his allowance, which totaled $74.80, to pay off his third-grade class's lunch debt, according to ABC 7.

""'Creating a California for All' means ensuring schools are inclusive, accepting, and welcoming of all kids. These bills help move us closer to that goal,"" Newsom said in a statement.

Steps to limit the so-called ""lunch shaming"" have taken root in recent years even before SB 265 was introduced by Newsom.

Notoriously high Santa Ana winds pushed the fire westward through dry brush in hilly subdivisions on the outskirts of Los Angeles.

The cause of the Los Angeles blaze wasn't immediately known, though arson investigators said a witness reported seeing sparks or flames coming from a power line near where the fire is believed to have started, Peter Sanders, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire Department, told The Associated Press.



Robert Delgado, who lives in Sylmar, Calif., said he saw flames under a high-voltage electrical transmission tower near his home at around the time the fire broke out.

""We had just finished praying the Rosary, like we do every night,"" when his wife looked out a window and saw fire at the bottom of the tower, Delgado told KABC-TV.

""We immediately ran downstairs, went to the backyard, pulled out the hoses,"" he said, but the wind-whipped flames moved with terrifying speed.

""We had just finished praying the Rosary, like we do every night. ... We immediately ran downstairs, went to the backyard, pulled out the hoses."" — Robert Delgado, resident of Sylmar, Calif.

""There were flames and embers flying over those bushes at the back of our house and over our house,"" Delgado said. ""I was overwhelmed at the sight."" He called it a miracle that his home survived.

L.A. police Chief Michel Moore said mandatory evacuations in the area have encompassed about 100,000 people in over 20,000 homes. Fire officials said at least 31 structures have been destroyed in the Saddleridge Fire. A middle-aged man who was near the fire went into cardiac arrest and died after apparently trying to fight the fire himself, authorities said.

Moore added that about 450 police were deployed in the area to prevent looting. Police officials allowed some residents to return to their homes for five minute visits Friday to recover important documents, small pets and other valuable before being escorted back to overcrowded shelters.

""It's not the fire itself but the danger of wind taking an ember, blowing it someplace, and seeing entire neighborhoods overnight get lit,"" Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Friday.

FEMA also accepted Newsom's request for a grant Friday to help local fire officials access resources.

“We are closely monitoring the fires burning across the state and are assisting state and local officials helping the tens of thousands of Californians affected by these fires,” Newsom said in a statement. “California thanks the White House for their timely response to our request, which will ensure the communities grappling with this fire have the vital resources and support they need.”

A local reporter tweeted video early Saturday showing the Saddleridge Fire still burning alongside the highway in Santa Clarita.

Los Angeles Fire Chief Ralph M. Terrazas said he flew over the fire Friday and saw ""hundreds, if not thousands of homes"" with charred backyards where firefighters had just managed to halt the flames.

Power was restored for nearly 2 million people Friday. Noting high wind conditions, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. switched off electricity Wednesday in an effort to prevent a repeat of the past two years when its power lines were blown into trees, sparking deadly and destructive wildfires outside the nation’s second-largest city.

Southern California Edison said it owns the transmission tower shown on KABC-TV, but a spokeswoman would not confirm that was where the fire began. The utility said it could take a long time to determine the cause and origin of the fire.

Cal Fire officials said one of the several fires burning in Southern California--the Sandlewood Fire--began after a garbage truck dumped burning trash on the side of the road.

* As expected, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) came out on top in the first round of balloting in the state’s gubernatorial race, but his 47% wasn’t enough to prevent a runoff. The incumbent will face millionaire novice Eddie Rispone (R), who received 27% support in the multi-candidate contest.

* Donald Trump, who headlined a rally in Louisiana late last week, said he pushed John Bel Edwards’ support from 66% to 47%. There is literally no evidence to support this – pre-election polls were surprisingly accurate – and the president has an unfortunate habit of touting made-up numbers.

* After Facebook refused to take down a Trump campaign ad with demonstrably false claims, Elizabeth Warren launched an ad of her own with deliberately false information – about Facebook.

* On a related note, the social-media giant responded by noting that broadcast stations have aired the same dishonest Trump ad. It opens an interesting door: broadcast stations are regulated by the FCC, while Facebook isn’t regulated by government agency.

* Beto O’Rourke’s campaign announced on Friday afternoon that it raised $4.5 million in the third quarter, which is an improvement on the second quarter. That said, nearly all of the top Democratic contenders had better July-to-September hauls.

* On a related note, O’Rourke said at CNN’s LGBTQ town-hall event last week that he believes houses of worship should probably lose their tax-exempt status if they oppose marriage equality. That’s almost certainly not a legally sound approach.

* Bernie Sanders noted in an ABC News interview, which aired yesterday, that there’s an important difference between his vision and Elizabeth Warren’s. “Elizabeth, I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones,” the Vermont independent said. “I’m not.”

* And four days after saying she was weighing a boycott of this week’s presidential primary debate, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) told supporters this week that she’s decided to participate. Barring any 11th-hour changes, it means 12 candidates will be on the stage tomorrow night."

Bernie Sanders – the self-proclaimed Democratic socialist whose standing in the 2020 primary has become threatened by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s surge in the Democratic primary with progressive voters – is seeking to cut into the support of his rival by dismissing her as a “capitalist.”

“There are differences between Elizabeth and myself,” Sanders said during an interview Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” “Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.”

BILLIONAIRES COULD FACE UP TO 97.5 PERCENT TAX RATES UNDER SANDERS’ PLAN: ECONOMISTS

The comments come amid a rise in socialism in the Democratic Party, as candidates become more willing to openly embrace socialism over capitalism. It also follows polling showing that Democrats now view socialism more positively than they do capitalism.

Last year, when asked if she was a capitalist, Warren reportedly said, ""I am a capitalist to my bones.""

Sanders explained he is not a capitalist because he ""will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary.”

A Gallup poll this year found that 43 percent of Americans think socialism would be a good thing for the United States, while 51 percent say it would be a bad thing. Gallup noted that in 1942, a Roper/Fortune survey that found 40 percent of Americans described socialism as a bad thing while only 25 percent called it a good thing.

The polling is fresh evidence that attitudes toward socialism are changing, amid the popularity in the Democratic Party of Democratic socialists like Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who pushes policies like “Medicare-for-all” and the Green New Deal.

Meanwhile, two economists at the University of California, Berkeley, claim that billionaires could face a 97.5 percent average effective tax rate under Sanders' plan, which would easily thump other Democrats running for president in 2020.

Emmanuel Saez, one of the professors, told Bloomberg that “with the wealth tax, you get directly at the stock instead of hitting the flow of income, making it a much more powerful de-concentration tool than income taxes."" The report pointed out that Sanders has said that the number of billionaires in the U.S. would be cut in half within 15 years under the plan.

The plan unveiled by Sanders seeks a 1 percent levy on households worth more than $32 million and proposes tax rates that would increase for wealthier people, up to 8 percent for fortunes in excess of $10 billion.

Sanders vowed to go further than Warren and generate more than $4 trillion over the next decade, substantially reducing billionaires’ fortunes. Billionaires would face a 62 percent average effective tax rate under Warren.

Sanders’ plan goes further because it starts on fortunes worth less, kicking in at $32 million. Warren also proposes increasing the wealth tax up to 3 percent on any net worth of more than $1 billion, while Sanders’ tax rates don’t top out until 8 percent for the richest households.

According to Farrow, Weinstein followed up by sending a column critical of Sanders, adding, ""This article gives you everything I discussed with you yesterday.""

An unnamed Clinton campaign official was said to have responded: ""About to forward some creative. Took your idea and ran.""

Representatives for Clinton and Sanders did not immediately respond to Fox News for comment.

A spokesman for Weinstein dismissed Farrow's reporting in a heated statement.

""Harvey Weinstein suggested that what Ronan Farrow insinuates as factual accounts are actually an amalgamation of unrelated pieces of information that he formed together to tell what is little more than a dramatic fictional tale,"" the spokesman said. ""His information is flawed, his 'facts' are inaccurate and his intention was to sell a novel, not break real news.

""The only facts here are that Harvey Weinstein did raise money for Hillary Clinton and was a staunch supporter of her presidential campaign.""

Bernie Sanders released a plan on ""corporate accountability and democracy"" that attempts to go further than proposals from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a rival progressive.

In part of a plan to reign in ""corporate greed"" released by his campaign Monday, Sanders would create a new agency within the Department of Commerce called the ""Bureau of Corporate Governance."" It would issue charters to large companies requiring them to base their actions on more than just the interest of shareholders. The plan would apply to corporations with more than $100 million in annual revenue or balance sheet total and to all publicly traded companies.

That is a significantly lower threshold than the $1 billion bar for annual revenue Warren pushed earlier this year in a proposal that called for a similar bureau to be created called the ""Office of United States Corporations.""

""This new federal charter will require corporate boards to consider the interests of all of the stakeholders in a company,"" the post on Sanders' campaign website says, ""including workers, customers, shareholders, and the communities in which the corporation operates.""

BERNIE SANDERS SLAMS ELIZABETH WARREN AS 'CAPITALIST'

Sanders, a self-identified democratic socialist, has long railed against big business and capitalism in general, and his newest proposal seeks to use the government to mandate that companies take into account how their behavior affects ""society at large.""

In another attempted one-up of Warren, Sanders' plan would require public companies and corporations with more than $100 million in annual revenue or balance sheet total to have employees elect 45 percent of their boards of directors. A Warren plan would require just 40 percent of such boards to be elected by employees and would apply to companies with $1 billion or more in yearly revenue.

During a Sunday interview with ABC's ""This Week"", Sanders slammed Warren for previously saying she is a ""capitalist through her bones.""

""I'm not,"" he told interviewer Jonathan Karl.

Sanders has battled with Warren for room in the progressive lane of the 2020 Democratic primary, with both seeking to provide a liberal alternative to former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden pitched himself to voters as a moderate compared to the rest of the Democratic field but could be a more vulnerable frontrunner than at any point in the campaign as he's been wrapped up in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump.

A Fox News survey released last week found Warren is beating Sanders by five points while Biden -- with 32 percent -- holds a significant 10-point lead over Warren.

After a heart attack earlier this month, Sanders will strive for a successful debate Tuesday, which could mollify some Democrats' fears about the 78-year-old's health.

Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, tweeted Monday morning that the president “has not yet seen the video, he will see it shortly, but based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video.”

The New York Times reported that the video was played during a conference held by American Priority, a pro-Trump group, at Trump National Doral Miami. The event was not hosted by the president or his reelection campaign. A Trump campaign spokesman, Tim Murtaugh, told the paper: “That video was not produced by the campaign, and we do not condone violence.”

The White House Correspondents Association said in a statement it was “horrified” by the video.

“The WHCA is horrified by a video reportedly shown over the weekend at a political conference organized by the president’s supporters at the Trump National Doral in Miami,” said Jonathan Karl, the president of the White House Correspondents’ Association and a journalist at ABC News. “All Americans should condemn this depiction of violence directed toward journalists and the president’s political opponents.”

The White House Correspondents Association called on Trump himself to denounce the video.

“We have previously told the president his rhetoric could incite violence,” Karl said. “Now we call on him and everybody associated with this conference to denounce this video and affirm that violence has no place in our society.”

According to the newspaper, the video seems to be an edited scene from a movie called the “Kingsman: The Secret Service.” The edited video shows the president’s head superimposed on a man opening fire inside a church — described in the video as the “Church of Fake News.” Those being shot in the pews have logos of media organizations on them.

The New York Times said a number of the president’s top allies were scheduled to appear at the conference, including his son Donald Trump Jr., former White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. The paper said Sanders and Trump Jr. both said they did not see the video.

Newsom said he was inspired by the story of Ryan Kyote, a 9-year-old boy from West Park Elementary who drew attention to how kids at his school were singled out because they didn't have enough money in their food accounts.

Kyote used his allowance, which totaled $74.80, to pay off his third-grade class's lunch debt, according to ABC 7.

""'Creating a California for All' means ensuring schools are inclusive, accepting, and welcoming of all kids. These bills help move us closer to that goal,"" Newsom said in a statement.

Newsom met with Kyoto in August, a meeting the governor declared was an ""honor.""

MILLENNIALS SAY ITALIAN FOOD IS THEIR FAVORITE BECAUSE IT'S 'INSTAGRAMMABLE,' SURVEY CLAIMS

""This amazing young man saved his allowance and used it to pay his classmates' lunch debt. For Ryan, it was just wrong that some kids couldn't afford to eat lunch. He's right about that,"" Newsom said at the time.

Steps to limit the so-called ""lunch shaming"" have taken root in recent years even before SB 265 was introduced by Newsom.

Sen. Bernie Sanders tweeted back in June after hearing of Kyote's story that he would provide ""year-round universal school meals"" if elected president of the United States.

CALIFORNIA BAN ON FUR PRODUCTS IS FIRST IN US

In June, U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D) introduced The No Shame at School Act, which bans identifying students who can't pay for their school lunch.

“Across this country, students whose families are struggling to afford school meals are being singled out and humiliated at lunchtime,” Omar said at the time, according to the Hill. “These students are subjected to various shaming practices at schools. Some students have been literally branded with stamps.”

BIDENS ACKNOWLEDGE ETHICS WOES

NYT: “Hunter Biden, whose overseas business dealings have drawn relentless attacks from President Trump and posed a threat to the candidacy of his father, Joseph R. Biden Jr., intends to step down from the board of a Chinese company, BHR, by the end of the month, his lawyer said on Sunday, a move his father later lauded in a forceful defense of his son’s integrity. The lawyer also said in a statement that if Mr. Biden were to be elected president, his son would ‘agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign-owned companies.’ The decision is the first action the pro-Biden camp has taken that appears to acknowledge the extent to which Hunter Biden’s business practices have created an untenable problem for his father’s 2020 campaign. With the fourth Democratic primary debate only two days away … Mr. Biden’s lower-polling Democratic rivals have suggested his son’s work overseas raises questions about conflict of interest.”



Rolls out ethics, campaign finance plan in reply - Reuters: “Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden would look to ban private money from federal elections, his campaign said on Monday in a plan for government ethics that doubled as an attack on President Donald Trump. … The former U.S. vice president is promising to match individual donations for elections with government funding, and to block cash from private sources. Biden would also establish a new commission to enforce anti-corruption laws, bar lobbying by foreign governments and require candidates to disclose their tax returns.”



Dems still hedging on Warren - NYT: “Senator Elizabeth Warren has built her following in part by taking pictures with thousands of voters deep into evening after campaign events, but her dinner audience [in Washington] one night last month was far smaller. And Ms. Warren’s guests were more interested in hearing, and politely challenging, her campaign pitch… Addressing a few dozen members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus at a Chinese restaurant a few blocks from the Capitol, she laid out her case… But just under a month since the family-style meal, the Massachusetts senator has the same small number of endorsements from congressional colleagues beyond her home state as she did beforehand: three. … [H]er growing crowd sizes, soaring fund-raising and surge to the top of a number of national and early-state polls only shine a brighter light on one of the most revealing elements of this primary: the widening gap between the preferences of many Democratic voters and the lawmakers who represent them.”



Trump said to still want Warren - Axios: “President Trump's allies still fear a general election matchup against a banged-up Joe Biden more than a run against an invigorated Elizabeth Warren, people close to the president tell Axios. Warren has surpassed Biden in some primary polls, seemingly helped by the early coverage of Trump's efforts to get Ukraine to investigate conspiracy theories involving Biden and his son Hunter. And a Fox News poll now shows Biden and Warren each would lead Trump, 50% to 40%. … Several advisers in Trumpworld told [Axios] that Warren is arguably a better candidate in terms of being quick on her feet and prepared on a debate stage. But those advisers say her liberal stances on some issues and her ‘likeability’ problem with segments of general election voters make her weaker against Trump than even a Biden hindered by gaffes, generational dissonances and a son with personal drama and a lobbying record.”



Sanders slams Warren as ‘capitalist’ - Fox News: “Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders … is seeking to cut into the support of his rival by dismissing her as a ‘capitalist.’ ‘There are differences between Elizabeth and myself,’ Sanders said during an interview Sunday on ABC’s ‘This Week.’ ‘Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.’ The comments come amid a rise in socialism in the Democratic Party, as candidates become more willing to openly embrace socialism over capitalism. It also follows polling showing that Democrats now view socialism more positively than they do capitalism. Last year, when asked if she was a capitalist, Warren reportedly said, ‘I am a capitalist to my bones.’ Sanders explained he is not a capitalist because he ‘will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary.’”

TIME OUT: BOOM

History: “[On this day 72 years ago] U.S. Air Force Captain Chuck Yeager becomes the first person to fly faster than the speed of sound. Yeager, born in Myra, West Virginia, in 1923, was a combat fighter during World War II and flew 64 missions over Europe. He shot down 13 German planes and was himself shot down over France, but he escaped capture with the assistance of the French Underground. After the war, he was among several volunteers chosen to test-fly the experimental X-1 rocket plane, built by the Bell Aircraft Company to explore the possibility of supersonic flight. … Yeager flew the X-1 over Rogers Dry Lake in Southern California. The X-1 was lifted to an altitude of 25,000 feet by a B-29 aircraft and then released through the bomb bay, rocketing to 40,000 feet and exceeding 662 miles per hour (the sound barrier at that altitude). The rocket plane, nicknamed ‘Glamorous Glennis,’ was designed with thin, unswept wings and a streamlined fuselage modeled after a .50-caliber bullet.”

AMBASSADOR LAYS UKRAINE CLAIMS OFF ON TRUMP

AP: “A U.S. ambassador is expected to tell Congress that his text message reassuring another envoy that there was no quid pro quo in their interactions with Ukraine was based solely on what President Donald Trump told him, according to a person familiar with his coming testimony in the impeachment probe. Gordon Sondland, Trump’s hand-picked ambassador to the European Union, is among administration officials being subpoenaed to appear on Capitol Hill this week against the wishes of the White House.”



Former top Russia aide talks, too - Politico: “President Donald Trump’s former top Russia aide arrived on Capitol Hill Monday to testify before House impeachment investigators, as Democrats accelerate efforts to unearth the facts of Rudy Giuliani’s shadow diplomacy with top Ukrainian officials. Democrats view Fiona Hill’s closed-door testimony as critical to their understanding of the extent to which Giuliani, the president’s personal attorney, bypassed official U.S. government channels by pressuring Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump’s possible opponent in the 2020 presidential election.”



Hairy situation: Inside the botched effort to hire Trey Gowdy - NYT: “For 24 hours last week, Trey Gowdy, the former South Carolina congressman best known for leading congressional investigations of Hillary Clinton, was the new face of President Trump’s outside legal defense and a symbol of a streamlined effort to respond to a fast-moving impeachment inquiry. A day later, the arrangement fell apart, with lobbying rules prohibiting Mr. Gowdy from starting until January, possibly after the inquiry is over. Now, according to two people familiar with events, Mr. Gowdy is never expected to join the team. And Trump advisers are back to square one, searching for a different lawyer.”



House impeachment roadmap shaping up - Axios: “Ahead of this week's subpoenas and depositions, new documents obtained by Axios show how Democrats are taking the impeachment inquiry in two tightly focused directions: Ukraine and obstruction of justice. Why it matters: There are new temptations for Democrats to broaden the scope of their inquiry after developments last week including President Trump's gift to Turkey, new questions about coordination with the Chinese over Hunter Biden, and the dramatic airport arrests of two of Rudy Giuliani's associates with Eastern European backgrounds and their indictments on campaign finance violations. But for now, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appears to be sticking with her instincts to keep the probe tight and as simple as possible for Americans to understand.”



RNC spends to tweak vulnerable House Dems on impeachment - McClatchy: “Republicans are planning to target Democrats in swing districts with a new round of ads on impeachment this week as lawmakers return from their fall recess. The Republican National Committee will spend $350,000 on a multi-media buy as part of a strategy that includes digital ads, text messages and phone calls starting Tuesday calling on Democratic House members to 'stop the madness.' The effort is primarily targeted at the 31 Democrats in districts President Donald Trump carried in 2016. ‘We’ll emphasize it’s time to move on,’ RNC spokesman Rick Gorka told McClatchy. ‘There are real issues they could be working on, anything but this.’ Rep. Lucy McBath, D-Georgia, who supports an impeachment inquiry, is one of the GOP targets.”

“I get it. He needs to pick a fight in order to stay relevant.” – Mayor Pete Buttigieg said about his gun fight with Beto O’Rourke in the latest episode of the Snapchat show Good Luck America.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Was Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch an Obama appointee or a Trump appointee? If she was a holdover from the Obama years doesn’t make a little bit of sense for Trump to do some housecleaning? From what I understand some Ambassador appointments are given to friends and people who do something (in the campaign) to help the president get into office.” – Mary Blanton, Alpharetta, Ga.



[Ed. note: There are all different kinds of ambassadors, Ms. Blanton. There are two main categories: political appointees and career diplomats. Among the “political” there are two broad groups: Positions of such import that presidents want trusted confidantes and loyalists. Then there are postings to places so safe and stable that they can be doled out to donors and key supporters as patronage plums. The divide on the “career” side is similar. Some are to places of little strategic importance but are so poor and/or remote that fat cats wouldn’t want to perch there. But many are to places where the work is just too sensitive to risk amateurism. Our ambassadors face terrible risks on a regular basis in places around the world where, but do so in service of crucial American goals. We want top people with deep knowledge of the language, culture and history of places like Iraq, Turkey and, yes, Ukraine, to serve in such posts. Yovanovitch is one of these folks. She was appointed to her former post by then-President Obama. But before that, George W. Bush appointed her to the strategically important former Soviet republics of Kyrgyzstan and Armenia. She started in the Foreign Service in 1986. She’s a lifer. So while it’s true that she was an Obama appointee, it’s probably better to think of her as a product of our Foreign Service system more than anything else.]



“I would love to hear your reaction to the following idea: There should be a law that the federal government cannot tax any citizen at a rate in excess of 33 1/3%. This is to prevent any candidate from getting votes by simply suggesting that they will tax ‘the rich’ at 50%, 60% or 70%. Low income people are apt to vote for those candidates for the wrong reason. What say you?” – Ted Boers, Grand Rapids, Mich.



[Ed. note: I hear you, Mr. Boers, but you’d have to quickly come up with a LOT of additional dough. Rich people – the 40 percent of highest earners – pay something like 70 percent of all the taxes. If you knock down the two top tax rates – 37 percent and 35 percent – that would be a lot of money off the table. Leaving aside that practical consideration, there’s this one: You’d really need a constitutional amendment to do what you’re describing. It’s very hard to imagine getting supermajority support for something that would immediately be unpopular with the bottom 60 percent of earners. In the coming fiscal disasters awaiting America, we’re going to have some tough fights over taxes and spending – the very fights lawmakers have been pushing off for decades. It’s going to be ugly and weird and a number of proposals once considered unthinkable will suddenly sound mainstream. Fiscal conservatives would probably do better to get ready for that moment.]



“In quite deservedly praising Cardinal shortstop Paul DeJong you parenthetically asked ‘(whoever heard of a slugger shortstop?).’ Does the name Ernie (Let’s play two) Banks ring a bell? In the four years from 1957 through 1960 when he was the Cubs regular shortstop he hit 176 home runs (yearly average 44), leading the league twice. Over that same period, he drove in 491 runs (yearly average 123), again twice leading the league. He wasn’t just an offensive force, winning a Gold Glove for his defensive play in 1960. Additionally, he was the National League Most Valuable Player in both 1958 and 1959 despite playing for a sorry team that in both years finished fifth in an eight team league. So, to answer your question — I have, as have the many others who undoubtedly have written to point out your egregious error. (I still love you).” – Bob Foys, Chicago



[Ed. note: There’s always a Cubs fan out there! Always! You are quite right, Mr. Foys. Other than to a lesser degree Robin Yount and Derek Jeter, Banks is the cream of the power hitting shortstop crop. I’m including your note for two reasons: 1) Goodness knows Cubs fans need something to be cheerful about in October 2) Maybe this expression of goodwill will help snap the Cardinals out of their slough of despair against the Nats!]

Metro: “A rhino was filmed going for a walkabout in a crowded market. The animal casually strolled past liquor shops and clothes showrooms in Nepal as shocked members of the public looked on. What was probably more surprising is no-one seemed to be scared of the rhino, which had strayed from the popular Chitwan National Park. Some tourists were so comfortable they even took selfies with the large beast on Thursday. Shankar Kandu Ravi, 31, from Uttar Pradesh in India, followed the elusive animal for about ten minutes and then took a picture with it. … Mr. Ravi said the rhino even came face-to-face with a couple but didn’t attack anyone. He added: ‘It was just acting to scare the couple. It warned people to not come close.’ ‘Next morning, I had inquired about it and learnt that it returned to the jungle early in the morning.’”

“If we are not prepared to wage total war in response to total war, we risk disaster on a scale we have never seen and can barely imagine.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in Time magazine on Oct. 28, 2001.

BILLIONAIRES COULD FACE UP TO 97.5 PERCENT TAX RATES UNDER SANDERS’ PLAN: ECONOMISTS

The comments come amid a rise in socialism in the Democratic Party, as candidates become more willing to openly embrace socialism over capitalism. It also follows polling showing that Democrats now view socialism more positively than they do capitalism.

Last year, when asked if she was a capitalist, Warren reportedly said, ""I am a capitalist to my bones.""

Sanders explained he is not a capitalist because he ""will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary.”

A Gallup poll this year found that 43 percent of Americans think socialism would be a good thing for the United States, while 51 percent say it would be a bad thing. Gallup noted that in 1942, a Roper/Fortune survey that found 40 percent of Americans described socialism as a bad thing while only 25 percent called it a good thing.

The polling is fresh evidence that attitudes toward socialism are changing, amid the popularity in the Democratic Party of Democratic socialists like Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who pushes policies like “Medicare-for-all” and the Green New Deal.

Meanwhile, two economists at the University of California, Berkeley, claim that billionaires could face a 97.5 percent average effective tax rate under Sanders' plan, which would easily thump other Democrats running for president in 2020.

Emmanuel Saez, one of the professors, told Bloomberg that “with the wealth tax, you get directly at the stock instead of hitting the flow of income, making it a much more powerful de-concentration tool than income taxes."" The report pointed out that Sanders has said that the number of billionaires in the U.S. would be cut in half within 15 years under the plan.

The plan unveiled by Sanders seeks a 1 percent levy on households worth more than $32 million and proposes tax rates that would increase for wealthier people, up to 8 percent for fortunes in excess of $10 billion.

Sanders vowed to go further than Warren and generate more than $4 trillion over the next decade, substantially reducing billionaires’ fortunes. Billionaires would face a 62 percent average effective tax rate under Warren.

Sanders’ plan goes further because it starts on fortunes worth less, kicking in at $32 million. Warren also proposes increasing the wealth tax up to 3 percent on any net worth of more than $1 billion, while Sanders’ tax rates don’t top out until 8 percent for the richest households.

""Private media outlets charge outrageous sums to run ads during presidential primary debates like tonight's — and many of their advertisers have vested interest in who is elected,"" he said. ""This type of influence must end. We're going to ban advertising during presidential primary debates.""

Tuesday's debate is co-hosted by The New York Times and CNN.

For the two primary debates it broadcast in July, CNN required companies to commit to at least $300,000 worth of advertising on the network in order to have a spot appear during a debate, according to Variety. The price for one 30-second ad in a CNN debate was $110,000, Variety reported, which is approximately 11 times higher than an average spot in its primetime programming.

In a copy of the book obtained by Fox News, Farrow wrote that Weinstein, who'd been a major fundraiser and longtime donor for the Democrats, was part of the ""brain trust around Hillary Clinton.""

Farrow pointed to an email exchange between the movie mogul and the Clinton campaign ahead of the election.

Referencing Sanders' outreach to Latino and African-American voters, Weinstein reportedly wrote, ""I'm probably telling you what you know already, but that needs to be silenced.""

According to Farrow, Weinstein followed up by sending a column critical of Sanders, adding, ""This article gives you everything I discussed with you yesterday.""

An unnamed Clinton campaign official was said to have responded: ""About to forward some creative. Took your idea and ran.""

Representatives for Clinton and Sanders did not immediately respond to Fox News for comment.

A spokesman for Weinstein dismissed Farrow's reporting in a heated statement.

""Harvey Weinstein suggested that what Ronan Farrow insinuates as factual accounts are actually an amalgamation of unrelated pieces of information that he formed together to tell what is little more than a dramatic fictional tale,"" the spokesman said. ""His information is flawed, his 'facts' are inaccurate and his intention was to sell a novel, not break real news.

""The only facts here are that Harvey Weinstein did raise money for Hillary Clinton and was a staunch supporter of her presidential campaign.""

In an interview, however, Sanders criticized Warren, saying she is a capitalist, but he himself is not.

“There are differences between Elizabeth and myself,” Sanders said during an interview Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” “Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.”

The comments come amid a rise in socialism in the Democratic Party, as candidates become more willing to openly embrace socialism over capitalism.

“When I was about 20 yrs old, I edited MLK audio, to expose how easily media can completely misrepresent reality. That intention has been clearly stated in the Youtube description for 10 years. It was supposed to be a ‘reminder that media on tv or the web can be edited to twist facts/reality.’ I am embarrassed to say it was also a pathetic attempt at comedy,” he wrote in a Medium post. “There was a time when the vulgar ridiculousness of the final product made me laugh.

Emmanuel Saez, one of the professors, told Bloomberg that “with the wealth tax, you get directly at the stock instead of hitting the flow of income, making it a much more powerful de-concentration tool than income taxes."" The report pointed out that Sanders has said that the number of billionaires in the U.S. would be cut in half within 15 years under the plan.

The plan unveiled by Sanders seeks a 1 percent levy on households worth more than $32 million and proposes tax rates that would increase for wealthier people, up to 8 percent for fortunes in excess of $10 billion.

Sanders vowed to go further than Sen. Elizabeth Warren and generate more than $4 trillion over the next decade, substantially reducing billionaires’ fortunes. Billionaires would face a 62 percent average effective tax rate under Warren.

Sanders’ plan goes further because it starts on fortunes worth less, kicking in at $32 million. Warren also proposes increasing the wealth tax up to 3 percent on any net worth of more than $1 billion, while Sanders’ tax rates don’t top out until 8 percent for the richest households.

Bernie Sanders released a plan on ""corporate accountability and democracy"" that attempts to go further than proposals from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a rival progressive.

In part of a plan to reign in ""corporate greed"" released by his campaign Monday, Sanders would create a new agency within the Department of Commerce called the ""Bureau of Corporate Governance."" It would issue charters to large companies requiring them to base their actions on more than just the interest of shareholders. The plan would apply to corporations with more than $100 million in annual revenue or balance sheet total and to all publicly traded companies.

That is a significantly lower threshold than the $1 billion bar for annual revenue Warren pushed earlier this year in a proposal that called for a similar bureau to be created called the ""Office of United States Corporations.""

""This new federal charter will require corporate boards to consider the interests of all of the stakeholders in a company,"" the post on Sanders' campaign website says, ""including workers, customers, shareholders, and the communities in which the corporation operates.""

BERNIE SANDERS SLAMS ELIZABETH WARREN AS 'CAPITALIST'

Sanders, a self-identified democratic socialist, has long railed against big business and capitalism in general, and his newest proposal seeks to use the government to mandate that companies take into account how their behavior affects ""society at large.""

In another attempted one-up of Warren, Sanders' plan would require public companies and corporations with more than $100 million in annual revenue or balance sheet total to have employees elect 45 percent of their boards of directors. A Warren plan would require just 40 percent of such boards to be elected by employees and would apply to companies with $1 billion or more in yearly revenue.

During a Sunday interview with ABC's ""This Week"", Sanders slammed Warren for previously saying she is a ""capitalist through her bones.""

""I'm not,"" he told interviewer Jonathan Karl.

Sanders has battled with Warren for room in the progressive lane of the 2020 Democratic primary, with both seeking to provide a liberal alternative to former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden pitched himself to voters as a moderate compared to the rest of the Democratic field but could be a more vulnerable frontrunner than at any point in the campaign as he's been wrapped up in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump.

A Fox News survey released last week found Warren is beating Sanders by five points while Biden -- with 32 percent -- holds a significant 10-point lead over Warren.

But, that’s just the first of many factors that could make this showdown – the first in a month – stand out.

BERNIE SANDERS SLAMS ELIZABETH WARREN AS A 'CAPITALIST'

“Since the last Democratic debate, the presidential race has dramatically shifted. Tonight is the first major gathering since the opening of the impeachment inquiry,” former Democratic National Committee chair and Fox News contributor Donna Brazile said.

The debate also comes as Joe Biden lost his long-held status as the unrivaled front-runner. The former vice president suddenly has been neck-and-neck with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for the top spot in many of the recent national and early-voting-state polls. And, Biden was left in the dust in the race for campaign cash, with both Warren and fellow progressive champion Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont each topping him by roughly $10 million in the July-September third quarter of fundraising.

The showdown also comes two weeks after the 78-year old Sanders suffered a heart attack. The debate is set to mark his return to the campaign trail and with questions regarding his health and stamina, the independent senator making his second straight White House run will be under the microscope.

With all that in mind, here are eight things to watch at the debate.

Impeachment

The debate is the first held since House Democrats launched a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter over their dealings in the eastern European country. Fueled by whistleblower complaints and a transcript of the call released by the White House, Democrats argued the president was pressuring a foreign country to interfere in a U.S. election.

Adding to the controversy was the fact that before the phone call, millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been put on hold; it ultimately was released in September. Despite allegations that Trump was using that money as leverage, the president insisted repeatedly that he did nothing wrong. He said there was no “quid pro quo” and on numerous occasions has described his conversation with the Ukrainian leader as “perfect.”

While all the candidates on the stage supported impeaching the president, the impeachment inquiry clearly will overshadow the showdown -- but will it dominate the debate to the detriment of other top issues in the Democrats’ presidential nomination race?

“There is a real danger that the substance of the debate is limited by the impeachment inquiry,” warned veteran political scientist Wayne Lesperance, the vice president of academic affairs at New England College.

Biden and Biden

While only one Biden will be on the stage, another certainly will be part of the conversation. While the former vice president is expected to use impeachment to frame the race as a fight between himself and the Republican incumbent, he likely will face questions about his son just hours after Hunter Biden’s first public interview since the start of the Ukrainian controversy.

As the president has fought back against impeachment, he and his allies instead have tried to put the spotlight on the Bidens.

Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden – as vice president – pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – who had faced widespread accusations of overlooking corruption in his own office – later was dismissed.

Biden, defending his actions in Ukraine, said, “there’s no truth to [Trump's] charges and attacks against me and my son. Zero.”

Trump’s also repeatedly raised questions about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of a Chinese private equity firm. This past Sunday, Hunter Biden resigned from the company – and on Tuesday morning – just hours before the debate – broke his silence in an interview with ABC News’ “Good Morning America.""

The younger Biden maintained that he did nothing improper while he served on the board of the Ukrainian energy company. But he acknowledged that accepting the lucrative position was, in retrospect, ""poor judgment.""

Some of Biden’s lower-tier rivals, looking for a breakout moment, may be tempted to criticize him over the optics of having his son sit on the boards of foreign companies while he served as vice president. However, it may be a slippery slope, as none of the Democrats seeking to unseat Trump may want to play into his playbook of targeting the Bidens.

Sanders’ health

“I’m ready,” Sanders emphasized in an email to supporters on Monday.

While all the candidates will be under the spotlight, it will shine extra bright for Sanders, who would have a unique challenge in needing to showcase that he hasn’t lost a step, and quell concerns that he may not be up to speed.

Analysts pointed out Sanders would need to show strength and agility, but the question for his rivals would be whether it’s a fair game for them to raise concerns about his health. Questions were raised about the late Sen. John McCain’s medical condition during the 2008 campaign and about the health of both candidates four years ago.

Sanders vs. Warren

Aside from some sniping by some of his top advisors, Sanders has not criticized Warren, as she’s mostly passed him by in the polls the past two months.

That’s why his labeling of his friend and populist senator – who’s produced one progressive policy proposal after another – as a “capitalist” made so much news this weekend.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

“There are differences between Elizabeth and myself,” Sanders said during an interview Sunday on ABC News’ “This Week.” “Elizabeth, I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.”

Will Sanders continue to draw contrasts with the rising Warren at the debate?

A former Sanders adviser – who for months raised alarms that Warren, rather than Biden, was the real threat – said the drawing of distinctions may be a necessity.

“Unfortunately, it’s a sign of concern on the part of Bernie and his camp that Warren is beating him with the voters that he needs,” noted Kurt Ehrenberg, a top adviser for Sanders in New Hampshire and the 2016 and 2020 campaigns who recently parted ways with the campaign.

A more aggressive Biden?

The former vice president seemed to get a second wind last week during two speeches in New Hampshire, when Biden gave a full-throated thrashing of Trump as he called for the president’s impeachment for the first time. Will that aggressive style of campaigning continue on the debate stage in Ohio?

“One of the problems I’m finding, I’ve got to be more aggressive,” Biden acknowledged during a fundraiser late last week in California. “I’ve had some difficulties on knowing to counterattack.”

A senior Biden campaign adviser told Fox News hours before the debate that ""what you'll hear tonight from the VP is that first and foremost, we have to keep the focus on Donald Trump's unprecedented abuse of power.""

Back in the spotlight

Health care – specifically the intra-party battle over “Medicare-for-all,” immigration, race relations and other domestically focused issues – has dominated the discourse at the first three rounds of debates. Foreign policy mostly has been relegated to the garbage time late in the showdowns, when the number of viewers dwindled.

But, with Turkey’s attack on northern Syria, unfolding soon after the president’s move to withdraw U.S. troops who had been fighting alongside Kurdish forces against ISIS militants, questions about Trump’s record on the world stage could be back in the spotlight.

That may benefit the candidates with foreign policy experience. Besides the obvious – Biden – such a discussion could give the two veterans in the field who’ve served in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii – a moment to shine.

Looking for a breakout moment

The debate could provide the opportunity the mid-tier candidates have been seeking – a standout moment in front of millions of viewers with less than four months to go until the voting begins in Iowa. Buttigieg, Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas all have been looking to gain some traction and break up the narrative that the race has been a three-candidate contest between Biden, Warren, and Sanders.

So will businessman and billionaire environment and progressive activist Tom Steyer, who’s making his first appearance on the debate stage.

Buttigieg – in a likely tease of things to come – took aim at Warren and Sanders for proposing to scrap private insurance as he touted his Medicare-for-all-who-want-it plan a new digital ad hours before the debate.

“Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren believe that we have to force ourselves into Medicare for all, where private insurance is abolished,” the narrator says in the ad.

Unpredictable moments

Gabbard made headlines in the second round of debates in July when she took aim at Harris, firing away at the former California attorney general’s record as a prosecutor. Last week, she made headlines when she threatened to boycott the debate to protest the “rigging” of the debates and the race for the nomination by the Democratic National Committee and its media partners.

Gabbard announced Monday morning that she would take part in the debate after all, and her planned appearance – after failing to qualify for the September showdown – had analysts wondering what she had next up here sleeve.

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro also has been looking to make some news. Castro – whose attacks on Biden’s age and memory at the September debate backfired, according to many analysts – is set to appear on the stage for what could possibly be the last time.

With the thresholds rising for the November showdown, Castro made a fundraising pitch to supporters, telling them ""I refuse to let tonight be my last time on the debate stage.""

A big debate moment would give him a boost to reach the new qualifying criteria."

Elizabeth Warren came under attack from all sides during Tuesday night's presidential debate, as former Vice President Joe Biden defiantly defended his son's business practices overseas and vehemently denied any wrongdoing.

All of the 12 Democrats onstage in Westerville, Ohio, meanwhile, backed the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Trump. In a sign of apparent disunity and hesitation among Democrats, though, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said only minutes before the debate began that there would be no vote on formally commencing the inquiry.

The debate marked the first time the candidates met since Pelosi's news conference last month at which she unilaterally declared the inquiry had begun -- a move that the White House has said is legally insufficient. The candidate lineup set a record for most politicians on a single debate stage, topping the 11 Republican candidates who assembled in 2016.

JOE BIDEN DEFENDS SON HUNTER'S UKRAINE WORK: 'MY SON DID NOTHING WRONG. I DID NOTHING WRONG'

""Sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that's the case with this impeachment inquiry,"" Warren, D-Mass., asserted at the outset of the debate, when asked why Congress should bother with the process given the impending election.

Biden has been at the top of the crowded field for months, but has come under withering assault from the White House concerning his son Hunter's lucrative overseas business dealings.

The elder Biden faced something of a timid confrontation over the issue during the debate, when CNN anchor and debate moderator Anderson Cooper broached the topic by stating, without evidence, that President Trump's accusations of misconduct by the Bidens were ""false.""

But Cooper pressed Joe Biden on Hunter's admission in a televised interview earlier in the day that he made a mistake by obtaining a lucrative role on the board of a Ukraine company, with no relevant expertise, while his father was vice president and handled Ukraine policy. (“I know I did nothing wrong at all. Was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is a swamp in many ways? Yeah,” the younger Biden said Tuesday morning.)

Joe Biden recently pledged that no members of his family would engage in foreign deals if he were to be elected president -- a tacit admission, Republicans said, of previous poor judgment or even wrongdoing.

""Look, my son's statement speaks for itself,"" Biden said. “My son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government which was to root out corruption in Ukraine, and that’s what we should be focusing on.”

Biden insisted he never discussed Ukraine matters with Hunter, although Hunter separately told The New Yorker magazine that the dealings had come up in one instance.

PROOF OF LINKS: FOX NEWS OBTAINS PHOTO SHOWING BIDENS GOLFING WITH UKRAINE EXEC, SEEMINGLY CONTRADICTING FORMER VP'S CLAIMS

He concluded: ""The fact of the matter is, this is about Trump's corruption. That's what we should be focused on.""

Later on, as the debate heated up, Biden remarked: “These debates are kinda crazy."" In a head-turning moment, he also stumbled over his words, saying wealthy individuals might be found ""clipping coupons in the stock market.""

Separately, asked about Trump's policy in Syria, Biden appeared to give an extended answer in which he meant to talk about Turkish President Recep Erdoğan -- but kept referencing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad instead.

HUNTER BIDEN BREAKS SILENCE ON HOW HE OBTAINED LUCRATIVE GIGS WITH NO RELEVANT EXPERTISE, BUT A VERY POWERFUL FATHER

Asked about his health toward the end of the debate, Biden vowed to release his medical records before the Iowa caucuses are held, and said his age (76) gives him ""wisdom.""

Hunter Biden obtained other high-paying board positions domestically and internationally, with no relevant expertise, while his father was a senator and vice president. For example, Hunter became an executive at the financial services company MBNA just two years after leaving law school. MBNA sources told Fox News this week that the company was trying to curry favor with Joe Biden, who was shepherding a bill favored by MBNA to passage in the Senate.

Meanwhile, Warren has climbed to co-front runner status but faces new questions about her dubious claims to Native American ancestry.

She was under attack from all sides at the debate for refusing to answer whether her ""Medicare for All"" plan would raise taxes for the middle class. Warren once again dodged the issue, insisting only that ""costs will go down"" for the middle class.

""I appreciate Elizabeth's work, but again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something you can actually get done,"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said to Warren. ""At least Bernie’s being honest here. ... I’m sorry, Elizabeth.”

“These debates are kinda crazy."" — Joe Biden

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg also lambasted Warren on health care: “Your signature is to have a plan for everything, except this,"" he said.

Buttigieg specifically knocked Warren for the nonanswer, saying her failure to offer a direct answer is ""why people are so frustrated with politicians"" and arguing that ""Medicare-for-All"" would ""unnecessarily divide this country.""

""We heard it tonight,"" Buttigieg said. ""A yes-or-no question that didn't get a yes-or-no answer."" He said he wanted a plan that could be summed up as ""Medicare-for-All"" if you choose it, not whether you want it or not.

Former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke also pressed Warren on the tax issue, to no avail. (Later on, O'Rourke had no answer when Cooper asked how he could confiscate Americans' firearms, given that the government has no way of knowing where the vast majority of AR-15s are located. He said only that he believes Americans ""will do the right thing"" voluntarily.)

Sen. Bernie Sanders, who wrote the ""Medicare-for-All"" legislation that Warren has embraced, said it was ""appropriate to acknowledge taxes will go up.""

Sanders, who Fox News has confirmed will soon be endorsed by New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, also spoke about his recent heart attack: “But let me take this moment, if I might, to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes. ... And I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and I'm so happy to be back here with you this evening.”

Also during the debate, Democrats also piled onto Warren for her signature proposal, a 2 percent wealth tax to raise the trillions needed for many of her ambitious proposals. Technology entrepreneur Andrew Yang noted that such a measure has failed in almost every European country where it's been tried.

The event, hosted by CNN and The New York Times, was on the campus of Otterbein University, just outside Columbus in Ohio, a state that has long helped decide presidential elections but has drifted away from Democrats in recent years.

Many of the candidates were struggling just to get noticed — trying to make up ground in a race that kicks off officially in just over three months with the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3. Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., are trying to crack the top tier.

In one possible indicator the debate was a lengthy one, Harris briefly mentioned her proposal to have Twitter take Trump's account down, and demanded that Warren explain why she felt that approach was unwise. Warren, who last week laughed openly when informed by a reporter of Harris' idea, responded that she wants Trump out of the White House, not just banned from Twitter.

Progressives and right-wing commentators alike were aghast at Harris' decision to again bring up the unrealistic and unpopular idea of somehow suspending Trump from Twitter.

""I cannot believe @KamalaHarris is pushing this suspend Donald Trump's twitter account bullshit at a presidential debate,"" former Obama administration official and Pod Save America cohost Tommy Vietor wrote on Twitter. ""It's so small ball. She is bigger and better than this.""

Fellow Obama administration alumnus and podcast host Ben Rhodes added: ""Seems like there are bigger issues in the world.""

Also debating were Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Obama housing chief Julián Castro and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. Making his debate debut — and likely angling for a splash — was billionaire activist Tom Steyer.

Gabbard hit The New York Times and CNN for waging what she called a propaganda campaign against her, while also promoting endless ""regime-change wars.""

""The New York Times and CNN have smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war,"" Gabbard said. ""Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist, and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.""

Gabbard has criticized Trump for how he's conducted the withdrawal in Syria, but said Tuesday that while Trump has ""the blood of the Kurds on his hands. ... So do many of the politicians in both parties who supported this regime change war.""

Gabbard, who was one of the last Democratic House members to back an impeachment inquiry, additionally lamented that some Democrats had been calling for Trump's impeachment since right after the 2016 election, undermining the party's case against him.

The debate's foreign policy discussion concluded without any mention by the moderators of the ongoing push by China to censor American companies, including the NBA and Blizzard Entertainment, from making or tolerating pro-Hong Kong statements. Buttigieg briefly mentioned that the Hong Kong protests were not receiving support from the White House.

Yang's plan for a universal basic income spurred a discussion onstage concerning whether a federal jobs guarantee is a better plan -- something of a remarkable achievement for Yang, who has struggled in the polls while advancing his own unique agenda.

On abortion, the Democrats agreed they would support a federal law ""codifying"" the Supreme Court's holding in Roe v. Wade, which found a constitutional right to abortion, as a kind of defense in case the Supreme Court overturned Roe. At the same time, Biden emphasized he would not support ""court packing,"" or passing a federal law to expand the size of the Supreme Court to load it with Democratic justices.

Buttigieg then said he did not support court packing, but wanted ""reforms"" to make the court less significant -- including possibly a ""fifteen member court, where five of the members can only be appointed by unanimous agreement of the other ten."" A similar idea was being debated in the Yale Law Journal, Buttigieg said, in a shout-out to the left-wing student publication.

Gabbard said that Democrats were right decades ago when they said abortion should be ""safe, legal, and rare"" -- highlighting a shift to the left among Democrats.

The 2020 field, which once had swelled to two dozen, has been shrinking as the Democratic Party's rules have mandated that candidates meet higher donor and fundraising thresholds to debate.

Just 10 White House contenders qualified for September's debate, but Gabbard and Steyer made Tuesday's lineup a record.

Earlier contests featuring 20 candidates were divided between two nights.

Author Marianne Williamson, who was not physically present at the debate on Tuesday because she failed to meet polling thresholds, remarked on Twitter as it unfolded: ""No, they're not the only Democratic candidates for President of the United States.""

Mayor Pete Buttigieg has released a 2020 campaign ad taking shots at ""Medicare-for-all"" proponents in the Democratic field, arguing that his health plan offers more freedom by letting people keep their private insurance.

The ad, released on Monday night, featured clips of multiple commentators supporting his ""Medicare-for-all who want it"" plan. ""Mayor Pete said a 'Medicare-for-all who want it.' That seems like a much better formulation -- working towards a universal health care system but it doesn't wipe out private insurance,"" CNN commentator Van Jones says in the ad.

The video was released on day before Tuesday's fourth Democratic debate, likely an indication that Buttigieg would try and go on offense against ""Medicare-for-all"" proponents like Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.

Previous Democratic debates have tended to focus on health care, which seems to be one of the primary sources of infighting among leading 2020 candidates. Former Vice President Joe Biden has borne the brunt of the criticism due to his desire to build on the Affordable Care Act enacted by former President Obama.

PETE BUTTIGIEG PROPOSES PUBLIC OPTION, SAYS IT COULD 'NATURALLY' LEAD TO 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

It's unclear how Buttigieg will address Biden but his ad mentioned Warren and Sanders by name. The spot claims that they want to abolish private insurance and suggests that labor unions might oppose Medicare for all because it would erase the previous gains they made in fighting for insurance.

Buttigieg's health plan offers a public option that includes automatic and retroactive enrollment for anyone without a private plan.

It's unclear how long Americans could maintain their private insurance under Buttigieg's plan, though, as he's already reinforced conservative fears about a public option providing unfair and ultimately destructive competition for private companies.

""If private insurers are unable or unwilling to offer better plans than they do today, competition from this public alternative will naturally lead to Medicare-for-all,"" he wrote in a Washington Post op-ed announcing the plan last month."

Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, tweeted Monday morning that the president “has not yet seen the video, he will see it shortly, but based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video.”

The New York Times reported that the video was played during a conference held by American Priority, a pro-Trump group, at Trump National Doral Miami. The event was not hosted by the president or his reelection campaign. A Trump campaign spokesman, Tim Murtaugh, told the paper: “That video was not produced by the campaign, and we do not condone violence.”

BERNIE SANDERS SLAMS ELIZABETH WARREN AS ‘CAPITALIST’

The White House Correspondents Association said in a statement it was “horrified” by the video.

“The WHCA is horrified by a video reportedly shown over the weekend at a political conference organized by the president’s supporters at the Trump National Doral in Miami,” said Jonathan Karl, the president of the White House Correspondents’ Association and a journalist at ABC News. “All Americans should condemn this depiction of violence directed toward journalists and the president’s political opponents.”

The White House Correspondents Association called on Trump himself to denounce the video.

“We have previously told the president his rhetoric could incite violence,” Karl said. “Now we call on him and everybody associated with this conference to denounce this video and affirm that violence has no place in our society.”

According to the newspaper, the video seems to be an edited scene from a movie called the “Kingsman: The Secret Service.” The edited video shows the president’s head superimposed on a man opening fire inside a church — described in the video as the “Church of Fake News.” Those being shot in the pews have logos of media organizations on them.

The New York Times said a number of the president’s top allies were scheduled to appear at the conference, including his son Donald Trump Jr., former White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. The paper said Sanders and Trump Jr. both said they did not see the video.

Warren stood at 30 percent support in a Quinnipiac University survey Monday of Democratic voters and independents who leaned toward the party. Biden, the unrivaled front-runner until Warren’s surge in the polls the past couple of months, was at 27 percent.

Warren’s three percentage point advantage was within the survey’s margin of error.

The poll was the third conducted by Quinnipiac since late last month showing Warren with a slight edge over Biden.

“For Senator Warren, the third straight time essentially tied at the top is the charm,” Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy emphasized. “Her candidacy clearly has staying power going into the debate.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont stood at 11 percent, with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent and Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 4 percent.

Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang and billionaire environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer each registered at 2 percent in the poll. The other candidates in the shrinking – but still large – field of contenders stood at 1 percent or less.

Quinnipiac’s survey differed from a Fox News poll released last week that indicated Biden at 32 percent, with Warren ten points back at 22 percent and Sanders at 17 percent. No other candidate cracked double digits in the Fox News survey.

THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL IN THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

Twelve candidates qualified for Tuesday’s debate, which is set to be held at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. They are – in alphabetical order – Biden, Booker, Buttigieg, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Harris, Klobuchar, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, Sanders, Steyer, Warren and Yang.

While national primary horserace polls have grabbed plenty of attention, the battle for the nomination is a fight for the states and their delegates. And, a new poll in New Hampshire, the state holding the first presidential primary, indicated a three-way tie at the top.

Warren stood at 25 percent support among likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State in a Boston Herald-Franklin Pierce University survey, with Biden at 24 percent and Sanders at 22 percent. Buttigieg stood at 9 percent and Harris at 5 percent, with no one else in the field topping 2 percent.

In New Hampshire’s Republican presidential contest, President Trump remained the overwhelming favorite against three extreme long-shot primary challengers, but his support has deteriorated from 88 percent a month ago to 71 percent in the survey. One of the primary challengers, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, saw his support jump from 3 percent in early September to 14 percent in the new survey.

""Just two years ago, AOC was an anonymous 20-something waiting tables and tending bars in New York City, and now she is literally one of the most influential politicians in the United States. Things like this don't happen in real life, right?"" the company asked.

""But it is happening and we are all witnesses. What makes it even crazier is that she's just getting started. Like if this were a trilogy, we’re probably only about 45 minutes into part one -- aka the origin story -- so let's recap.""

OCASIO-CORTEZ DEFENDS TWEET PROMOTING IDEA OF 'PRISON ABOLITION,' PUSHES 'JUST ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION'

The page delves into a timeline starting with Ocasio-Cortez's birthday in 1989 and her placing second at a science fair. When it reaches her college years, the graphic highlights how she participated in a music video -- one that led to criticism from some conservatives at the time it resurfaced.

The promotional video also praises AOC for supporting a climate protest outside of then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's office in November of 2018. Since becoming House speaker, Pelosi, D-Calif., has clashed with the congresswoman -- suggesting her social media following was relatively insignificant when compared with the amount of power she and other progressives had in Congress.

But FCTRY touted her Twitter following -- 5.5. million followers -- along with her status as the youngest congresswoman ever elected.

Guy Benson: We'll get to our guests in a moment. Coming up later in this hour Congressman Adam Kinzinger will join me as well. Guy Benson show dot.com is our Web site please subscribe to the podcast if you'd like. That's Guy Benson show dot.com. We begin this hour with Senator Rand Paul a Republican of Kentucky. He has a brand new book out the case against socialism. Senator good to have you back.

Sen. Rand Paul: Glad to be with you Guy.

Sen. Rand Paul: So before we get to the book and we'll definitely delve into that I just want to ask you about your reaction. There was a statement out from the White House today from the president announcing new sanctions against Turkey the redeployment of American troops in the region to monitor what's happening in Syria and to as the president says prevent a repeat of 2014 if ISIS were to reconstitute. Do you favor these sanctions do you favor having troops in the area to possibly intervene if necessary.

Sen. Rand Paul: You know I think our founding fathers were very prescient when they assigned the role of deciding when we go to war to Congress. And so it's sort of a separation of powers issue that has gotten lost over time. But our founding fathers were very clear. You know Madison said that the executive branch is most prone to war. Therefore we delegated that power. You know we vested that power in the branch the legislative branch because they were fearful of having a president that was too powerful and too much war. And so really if people want to be at war in Syria there needs to be a big debate in Congress and that's how you determine whether something's in in one's national interest. People throw that term around loosely and say well it's in our national interest to be in Syria. And like most Americans are scratching their heads saying really to be in the middle of a five sided complicated war where some of these people been fighting more than a hundred years some of these few have been fighting a thousand years where the way we determine whether we should be there is we have a big spirited debate in Congress and the legislature decides whether we should be at war. The problem with Syria is if we had that debate I don't think anybody up here knows who would be at war with or are going to be at war with Turkey our NATO ally Turkey is allied with a Free Syrian Army which was also our ally for seven years but they're now fighting with Turkey. You've got Assad on the other side and the Russians and the Iranians and you've got the Kurds somehow in the middle. And I think one of the ironic things that you've already seen within the first 48 hours here is the Kurds are now appealing to Assad for protection. And it really is probably the best chance of the Syrian Kurds to ever have any autonomy within Syria is probably having the protection of Syrians and having an intact border between Syria and Turkey. So I think we'll see what happens but I'm very hopeful actually that the new twists and turns will lead to a negotiated settlement. I think what's prevented a negotiated settlement previously has been that the neocons and the people who want to stay everywhere forever have insisted that Assad go that we have regime change in Syria and that insistence has meant that Syria and Assad can't be any part of a negotiated settlement. So you can't have a negotiated settlement if you don't have two parties to it.

Guy Benson: OK. And look I understand your point about the separation of powers in your view of presidential power and war powers what the Constitution says but sanctions for example against Turkey. That's something that is being openly discussed and will be debated in Congress. If there were a significant sanctions package against Turkey based on what they are doing on the ground in Syria is that something that you would be willing to support if it's debated and passed through Congress. You mentioned Turkey as a NATO ally. Do you consider them an ally at this point.

Sen. Rand Paul: I consider them sort of a frenemy. I don't think they've been a great ally and I'm not big on sort of this forever commitment to everybody that's in NATO. That's why I haven't wanted to keep adding people to NATO. So no I don't think they I don't think Turkey's been a good ally in recent times. I think their purchase of Russian missiles should exclude them from any of our weapons. And so there are different ways you can try to use our leverage over Turkey to try to get them to behave in a way that is consistent with them being an ally. But the first step I think would be without question withholding weapons and I've been for withholding weapons from Turkey simply because of their purchase of the Russian missiles. This is an additional reason why I withhold weapons. I separate withholding weapons from sanctions for a couple of reasons. I think sanctions work a little more indiscriminately on the on the population of Turkey and often can turn the population of a country against America whereas withholding holding arms then really hurt anybody in Turkey. It just prevents Turkey from doing things ultimately with those arms that we disapprove of. I would have done the same with Saudi Arabia. I greatly object to the crown prince and I would have withheld arms until we got better behavior out of Saudi Arabia. But I wouldn't vote or wouldn't actually really not prefer any way. Sanctions against Saudi Arabia because I think really trade and continuing of trade unless you're at war with somebody is probably the better part of valor.

Guy Benson: Last question on this subject. And it goes to I think one of the arguments that non interventionists make and the president has made this argument as well and I think it appeals to a lot of voters which is we shouldn't be embroiled in these complicated conflicts where our interests are muddy at best. And I understand boots on the ground by the many thousands in a place like Syria is going to have a lot of detractors here in America I'm skeptical of it myself. But when you look at the Kurds these are the type of people that a lot of non interventionists say that's that's what we need people in that region taking care of their own dirty work in this case fighting and taking many casualties against ISIS with our support if we support people and they they die by the thousands fighting ISIS which I think is definitely in the U.S. broader interest isn't it. Isn't it a problem if we then abandon those people forcing them into the arms of Assad and Russia.

Sen. Rand Paul: Well see I'm not so necessarily sure that it's going to be a bad thing that they will be with Assad. I think it's actually their best time and the chance for actually having a homeland unless the U.S. is going to send 10 20 30 40 50 thousand troops over there to create a homeland form and guard them against everybody from around there. So no I don't think it is in their best interests but my obligations to the Constitution and I think it's complicated in the sense that people think go Kurds or Kurds well they're Turkish Kurds who are Iraqi Kurds and are Syrian Kurds. They don't necessarily all like each other. They have different political parties. The Syrian Kurds primary political arm is socialist and has been terrorist within Turkey and they do want part of Turkey they want part of Turkey to be split off into a Greater Kurdistan and Turkey objects to that. They've been fighting over this issue for 50 60 70 maybe even 100 years. So I think we have to look at it that way and decide. But also I think we have to ask what is the best chance for the Kurds. People have written these ridiculous things saying oh the Kurds have been fighting our war for us what a bunch of hogwash. The Kurds have been fighting for their villages and for their towns and for their women and for their families. And we help them but that doesn't mean that we said oh yeah we've been helping you fight against these terrible people ISIS What Should Be thank you not oh we're now so mad that you're not going to stay forever and create a country for us. President Trump said that he would help the Kurds with ISIS to defeat ISIS. We did. And so really the answer should be not oh yo you ungrateful people you won't help us forever it should be thank you so much for helping us kill these awful people we now control these villages but we're in the middle of a country that we're going to have to deal with. And I don't think the Kurds are physically able nor are we ever going to carve out a region of Syria and say This is yours. But there is a semi-autonomous area within Iraq that is working that should be the model. I think if they work with the host government which is Assad for better or worse the war is over people then go. What are we going to do keep battling on. And what would we have done if Lindsey Graham and Hillary Clinton had gotten their way and the Sunni extremists had won in Syria would we be better off. No I think they would have been a calamity for al-Qaeda and al Nusra to win the war. Assad is a bad guy but I think Al Nusra was worse.

Guy Benson: Yeah I mean and that's certainly debatable. I mean one of my biggest concerns is about ISIS. Some of these guys high value guys escaping and reconstituting and at some point posing enough of the threat where America feels like Okay now we have to go back in. But Senator we'll put a pin in that discussion because it's ongoing I want to talk about your book The Case against socialism it's brand new. You had a bit of let's say an eventful appearance on The View this week. I'll play briefly cut 24. This was an argument that Ana Navarro made about socialism and Venezuela. Listen. Well if you vote for a socialist you might get socialism.

Video Clip: Come on. Don't do that.

Guy Benson: And then she says Maduro is not a socialist. He's a corrupt murderous thug who is starving his people. Just if you would Senator. This came as news to me that Maduro isn't a socialist of course he's a socialist and when socialism often is fully implemented you get messy bloody ugliness throughout history all over the world. But what about maybe a kernel of truth in her argument which is there are forms of maybe social democracy that I oppose but are not the type of corrupt violent socialism that we see in a place like Venezuela that some of the American socialists would aspire towards as opposed to the disaster in Caracas.

Sen. Rand Paul: Well we certainly get to that. But her first point is about Venezuela. She's saying Maduro is a thug and a murderer but not a socialist and my response had she let me speak was that. Can't you be both. Can't you be both a socialist and a thug and it's even more than that. One of the themes of our book The Case against socialism is that perhaps it's not just an accident that you get violence and accident that you get thuggery. Maybe it's an inevitability that if you try to completely socialize things if you tried to appropriate the property or the farms and the businesses that ultimately you can't really do that with a kinder gentler dictator. It takes a ruthlessness if you really want to have full and complete socialism. It does take that ruthlessness. You're right. They look at Scandinavia and they say oh well what about democratic socialism in Scandinavia. Well they've got it all wrong. Scandinavia is not socialist in fact the prime minister of Denmark said to Bernie Sanders Pipe down you know we're not socialist you're you're bad for business we don't want the world to think we are socialist. And when you look closely at Scandinavia which my wife and I did in this book what you actually find is they are a welfare state with a lot of so-called free stuff sort of the freebies of socialism. But the interesting thing is what what Bernie Sanders says is a big lie. He says the rich will pay for all of these things if we bring it to America in Scandinavia. The working class pay a 25 percent sales tax and the middle class pays 60 percent income tax. So the dirty little truth about sort of big welfare states.

Guy Benson: Say that again is the middle class pays 60 60 percent income tax.

Sen. Rand Paul: 60 percent income tax starting at around sixty thousand in Scandinavia. So you have these enormous taxes on the middle class and a 25 percent tax on everyone. But that's you know when you talk about a burden as far as your income the poor and the working class paying a 25 percent sales tax is a big burden for the poor. So you can have the so-called welfare state of Scandinavia. It's not socialism but you can have that big welfare state but you cannot have it by just taxing the rich. That is the big lie Bernie and AOC is they say oh we're going to tax the rich. There's only a few of them anyway. They don't have any votes. You know nobody will care. And this is a demagoguery that we have to expose because in reality Scandinavian welfare ism is supported by massive taxes on the working class and the middle class.

Guy Benson: And would that be your criticism of Elizabeth Warren as well because she's trying to distance herself from Bernie saying I'm not a socialist. Into my bones on the capitalists but a lot of her policies look awfully similar to Bernie's.

Sen. Rand Paul: Well she's more Medicare for All which basically would cost 60 trillion dollars. Where's the money going to come from. Some reporters have begun asking her are you going to tax the middle class. Bernie at least admits that he's going have to tax somebody but you'll save a lot of money on the free insurance. Elizabeth Warren has been unwilling to answer the question but it is an important question where's the 60 trillion coming from with Bernie and I see the problem is they say they're going to tax people but what they propose for taxes is not nearly enough to pay for their you know their dreams of this paradise. They want to create.

Guy Benson: Less than a minute to go. Let me pick up on Medicare for All or single payer health care from your perspective as a medical doctor what's the moral case not just the what will it cost price tag issue what's the moral case in your eyes as a doctor against government run health care.

Sen. Rand Paul: Well leads to shortages it leads to terrible quality and leads to doctors you know selling meat out of the back of an ambulance. We tell that story in our book The Case against socialism. So it just doesn't work practically. But it's also this idea that Bernie seems to put out there that somehow he has a right to a doctor services or a nurse's services and that really is an immoral notion to believe that anyone has the right to someone else's labor.

Guy Benson: Senator Rand Paul a Republican from Kentucky. His new book just out the case against socialism Senator thank you. Thank you. We will step aside and be right back as the guy Benson show continues."

Bolton told aide to alert National Security Council lawyer after meeting with Ukrainians about investigations: impeachment testimony

Fiona Hill, the former senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs, told lawmakers investigating possible impeachment charges against President Trump on Monday that a July meeting with Ukrainian and U.S. officials about unspecified investigations left her and John Bolton, the former national security adviser, so concerned that he directed her to alert a lawyer in the National Security Council, Fox News confirmed. The meeting in question took place July 10, a little more than two weeks before President Trump's controversial call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. Both Bolton and Hill, who were present at the meeting, had concerns about the conversation, she testified.

Hill, who exited the administration days before the July 25 phone call, testified on Monday for about nine hours in front of three House panels. The Wall Street Journal reported that those at the hearing took her comments to refer to the ""investigation that could implicate Biden and his son."" Click here for more on our top story.

In addition, Hill had high praise for ousted U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch during testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. Yovanovitch, who herself testified before congressional lawmakers last Friday as part of the impeachment inquiry, was recalled from her ambassadorship in May by Trump, around the same time that Rudy Giuliani — Trump's personal attorney — pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate corruption allegations against Democrat Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who was involved with the board of a gas company there.

Democratic dozen at fourth presidential primary debate will be a record-breaker

A really big stage is set the fourth round of Democrats' presidential primary debate Tuesday night. Twelve candidates have qualified, meeting the polling and fundraising criteria. That means the showdown tonight will be the largest in presidential primary history, topping the 11 Republicans who faced off in a primary debate in September 2015, according to political research from Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a political newsletter and website.

The dozen Democratic White House contenders who made the cut are – in alphabetical order: former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; businessman and environmental advocate Tom Steyer; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

Twelve candidates on the same stage at the same time could make for an unwieldy debate and a lot of jockeying for time and attention. The debate will be held at Otterbein University, a liberal arts institution in Westerville, Ohio. The Democratic National Committee's media partners for the showdown are CNN and The New York Times. All eyes will be on Bernie Sanders, who just two weeks ago was rushed to the hospital when he suffered a heart attack.

Trump imposes sanctions on Turkey, threatens more severe penalties, to stop invasion into Syria

President Trump on Monday authorized sanctions and raised steel tariffs on Turkey and threatened more severe financial penalties if Ankara continued its military offensive in northern Syria launched the president decided to withdraw U.S. troops from the region more than a week ago. Trump also urged Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to negotiate a peaceful end to the violence is sending Vice President Mike Pence and White House National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien to lead a delegation to Turkey to seek a resolution to the conflict.

In addition, the president announced, U.S. troops in northeastern Syria will be withdrawn from the country as planned and redeployed “in the region to monitor the situation and prevent a repeat of 2014,” when the Islamic State made major territorial gains.

Trump mulls idea of lawsuit against CNN over recording of network 'bias'

President Trump on Monday floated a lawsuit threat against CNN over reports that the network’s president, Jeff Zucker, launched an internal bias campaign to undermine his presidency. In a tweet posted Monday evening, Trump said, “’Project Veritas-Obtained Undercover Videos Highlight Jeff Zucker’s (@CNN) Campaign To Destroy Trump. Videos Reveal @CNN’s BIAS!’ @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Does this sound like a good, or even great, lawsuit?”

The president’s latest gripe with CNN comes after conservative activist group Project Veritas published undercover recordings from an alleged “whistleblower” that capture CNN employees casually confirming the network's anti-Trump bias and show Zucker telling top news executives to focus solely on impeachment even at the expense of other important news.

LeBron James calls Rockets' GM Morey 'misinformed' over Hong Kong tweet

Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James said Monday that Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey was “misinformed” when he posted a tweet that kicked off a costly dispute between the NBA and its Chinese fans and sponsors. “I’m not here to judge how the league handled the situation. I just think that when you’re misinformed or you’re not educated about something – and I’m just talking about the tweet itself – you never know the ramifications that can happen,” James told reporters on Monday night back in Los Angeles.

BIDEN SON: UKRAINE DEALS ‘POOR JUDGEMENT’ IN ‘A SWAMP’

ABC News: “As President Donald Trump continues to fill his Twitter feed and campaign speeches with attacks on Hunter Biden over his foreign business deals, the former vice president’s son defended the ethical implications of his private ventures in an interview with ABC News, but conceded taking a misstep in failing to foresee the political implications on his father’s career. ‘In retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part. Is that I think that it was poor judgment because I don't believe now, when I look back on it -- I know that there was -- did nothing wrong at all,’ said Biden. However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is...a swamp in—in—in many ways? Yeah.’”



Fight night in Ohio - Politico: “Bernie Sanders is recovering from his heart attack. Joe Biden is under siege, and laying into Donald Trump. And the entire Democratic presidential field has become consumed with the House’s impeachment inquiry into the Republican president. With so many candidates responding to circumstances beyond their control — and the threat of a destabilizing moment running high on a stage that’s expanding to 12 candidates from 10 — it’s raising the specter of a debate Tuesday that finally breaks the Democratic primary logjam. Not only is it the first debate since Sanders was hospitalized and the impeachment inquiry began, it also comes as many lower-polling candidates become increasingly desperate to make a mark on the campaign. At a fundraiser in Los Angeles last week, Biden acknowledged how much of the debate is out of any candidate's hands. … Biden said, ‘One of the problems I’m finding, I’ve got to be more aggressive.’”



Will Buttigieg throw elbows? - Politico: “Pete Buttigieg sees a path to the top tier of the Democratic primary field, elbowing his way between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren on one side and Joe Biden on the other. At the center of Buttigieg’s push is his health care plan, which the South Bend, Ind., mayor has dubbed ‘Medicare for all who want it.’ The plan would extend a public health insurance option to Americans without ending the private insurance market, an effect of the plan put forward by Sanders and endorsed by Warren. … Buttigieg also argued that his health care plan is tougher on insurance providers than Biden’s own public option proposal to build on Obamacare. ‘It turns out that setting up the exchanges has not been enough to empower all Americans to have good coverage,’ Buttigieg said.”



Beto says he need to ‘break through’ - Texas Tribune: “Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke raised $4.5 million in the third quarter, his campaign announced Friday as he acknowledged it was more urgent than ever to ‘break through’ in the still-crowded primary. The third-quarter total is an improvement over the $3.6 million that the former El Paso congressman took in during the previous quarter, and it came despite a halt to fundraising for roughly two weeks in August after the deadly El Paso shooting. Still, the total puts him behind a majority of primary rivals who have released their third-quarter figures so far, including two leading candidates who each raised around $25 million.”



Bloomberg back to floating trial balloons - CNBC: “Mike Bloomberg might end up running for president, after all. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, has indicated to associates in recent weeks that Joe Biden’s recent struggles against Sen. Elizabeth Warren are making him rethink his decision to stay out of the 2020 Democratic primary. That’s according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were deemed private. Bloomberg has signaled he’s ‘still looking at’ running for president, but people close him say that the only way he could even go down that path is if Biden’s fortunes suffer so much that he drops out before or during the early stages of the primary. Bloomberg could then enter the race as one of the rare moderates with enough name recognition and campaign funding to make a run.”



Dems on edge over cyberattacks - Politico: “The Democratic National Committee sent an urgent alert on Monday to every presidential campaign aimed at avoiding a repeat of the cybersecurity fiasco the party suffered at the hands of Russia and Wikileaks in 2016. The subject of the email was ‘Counter-Disinformation Update,’ and it was part of a regular series of communications by DNC Tech, the party’s in-house group responsible for internal security and monitoring the spread of fake news about Democrats. POLITICO obtained the full archive of DNC’s Tech’s missives to the presidential campaigns. They reveal a party struggling to combat the continued onslaught of the twin threats faced by the Democratic Party: cyber penetration from state actors abroad and the spread of disinformation about its top presidential candidates by Donald Trump and his allies at home. … It was a moment, the DNC warned, to be hyper vigilant about fake news.”



Seven years later, Warren changes tune on health care - Politico: “Seven years before Elizabeth Warren said ‘I’m with Bernie on Medicare for All,’ she was campaigning for the Senate and didn’t want to talk about single-payer health care. Running a tough race against Republican incumbent Scott Brown, the first-time candidate repeatedly distanced herself from the idea. … But during her first Senate campaign in 2012, she … dodged the question again and again, according to an analysis of newspaper reports, TV, and interviews with health care reform activists at the time. … Warren's refusal to embrace single-payer during that campaign came four years after she co-wrote an essay that called it the ‘most obvious’ solution to the nation's health care woes — though perhaps ‘politically unacceptable.’ Warren’s remarks in 2012, as well as her more circumspect attitude toward Medicare for All at the beginning of her presidential campaign, has exposed her to criticisms from the left.”



Warren strong in Q Poll, but still lags on electability - Quinnipiac University: “One day before the next Democratic debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden remain locked in a close race for the top spot in the Democratic primary, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. Warren receives 30 percent of the vote among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, while Biden gets 27 percent.. … However, on the question of electability - which candidate has the best chance of winning against Donald Trump - Biden retains his commanding lead with 48 percent saying he has the best chance, compared to 49 percent in August. While still trailing Biden, Warren has increased her support from 9 percent in August to 21 percent today. No other candidate gets into double digits.”

TIME OUT: TO THE HOLY LAND

Smithsonian: “On April 1483, a German politician named Bernhard von Breydenbach embarked on a religious pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Breydenbach and his companions—among others, Dutch artist Erhard Reuwich—traveled at a leisurely clip, touring destinations including Venice, Corfu, Modon and Rhodes while en route. Two years after his pilgrimage, Breydenbach created an illustrated guide detailing the farflung locales he had visited on his trip. The text, titled Peregrinatio in Terram Sanctam, or A Pilgrimage to the Holy Land, was an instant sensation, with eleven editions in six languages published between 1486 and 1505.

BOLTON CALLED FOUL ON TRUMP-GIULIANI UKRAINE MOVES

Fox News: “Fiona Hill, the former senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs, told lawmakers on Monday that a July meeting with Ukrainian and U.S. officials about unspecified investigations left her and John Bolton, the former national security adviser, so concerned that he directed her to alert a lawyer in the National Security Council, Fox News confirmed. Hill, who exited the administration days before the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky, testified on Monday for about nine hours in front of three House panels where she reportedly raised concerns about a July 10 meeting. The Wall Street Journal reported that those at the hearing took her comments to refer to the ‘investigation that could implicate Biden and his son.’”



Giuliani got big bucks from indicted Ukrainian - Reuters: “President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was paid $500,000 for work he did for a company co-founded by the Ukrainian-American businessman arrested last week on campaign finance charges, Giuliani told Reuters on Monday. The businessman, Lev Parnas, is a close associate of Giuliani and was involved in his effort to investigate Trump’s political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, who is a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic Party nomination. Giuliani said Parnas’ company, Boca Raton-based Fraud Guarantee, whose website says it aims to help clients ‘reduce and mitigate fraud’, engaged Giuliani Partners, a management and security consulting firm, around August 2018. Giuliani said he was hired to consult on Fraud Guarantee’s technologies and provide legal advice on regulatory issues.”



Feds dig deeper - WSJ: “Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are examining Rudy Giuliani’s business dealings in Ukraine, including his finances, meetings and work for a city mayor there, according to people familiar with the matter. Investigators also have examined Giuliani’s bank records, according to the people. Witnesses have been questioned about Giuliani since at least August by investigators, who also want to know more about Giuliani’s role in an alleged conspiracy involving two of his business associates, the people said. The investigation is being led by the U.S. attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York. Giuliani has denied wrongdoing and on Monday said he hadn’t been informed of any investigation. ‘They can look at my Ukraine business all they want,’ he said.”



Dems return from recess more united on impeachment - WaPo: “…Just days after suddenly embracing an impeachment inquiry of President Trump — a moment of seeming political crisis — House leaders sent lawmakers home for their scheduled two-week recess. But as Congress returns to work Tuesday, fears of lost momentum, internal dissension and dissipating interest in impeachment have mostly evaporated among House Democrats, who view the past two weeks as among the most damaging to Trump as they dig in for their constitutional showdown with the president. … But on the central question of whether Trump ought to be investigated for potentially committing high crimes and misdemeanors worthy of removal from office, Democrats are now largely united: Only seven of 235 House Democrats have stopped short of endorsing the impeachment inquiry, and the White House position, laid out in a letter sent to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and three committee chairmen last week, has hardened the resolve of many Democrats.”

FOR THE LONG RUN

WNEP: “The Steamtown Marathon [in Scranton, Pa.] brings out hundreds of spectators each year to cheer for the runners… For the last 24 years, 90-year-old Marie Rupp has been hosting a water station for the thousands of runners that make their way through the borough. … But this year is different. After a fall, Marie went to live at a rehab facility. It would be the first marathon she would not be out cheering for the runners. That's when her neighbors stepped in. ‘We felt it very important to get her out of there for the day and bring her back to the tradition that she started,’ said Sean Osborne of Archbald. Wrapped in a blanket with a space heater for extra warmth, Marie was on Laurel Street with her neighbors as runners passed by. And while she says she is no longer in charge, her neighbors know she still calls the shots. … ‘It's exciting! It puts life in our bones,’ Marie said.”

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., announced that she would no longer be accepting campaign donations of more than $200 from big businesses and challenged her fellow White House hopefuls to be more transparent about how they’re funding their own campaigns.

Warren blasted some of her Democratic primary rivals in a post on Medium, in which she accused them of “hobnobbing with the rich and powerful” and “handing out secret titles and honors to rich donors.”

“I’m proud to be running a grassroots-funded campaign for president, and I hope my fellow candidates for the Democratic nomination will do the same,” Warren wrote. “That’s why I’m also calling on every candidate in this race to disclose any donor or fundraiser who has a special title on their campaign…and to disclose the dates and locations of their fundraising events and the names of every person who appears on a host committee on invitations tied to those events.”

THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL IN THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

Warren added: “If Democratic candidates for president want to spend their time hobnobbing with the rich and powerful, it is currently legal for them to do so – but they shouldn’t be handing out secret titles and honors to rich donors. Voters have a right to know who is buying access and recognition — and how much it costs.”

In her post, Warren does not specifically call out any of her fellow candidates, but her words appear to be a rebuke of Democratic presidential primary hopefuls like former Vice President Joe Bide, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif, and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Each of these candidates have raised millions of dollars through fundraisers and private events with wealthy donors — a practice that is common in both major political parties in the U.S.

Warren, along with fellow candidate and Vermont lawmaker Bernie Sanders, have spurned big-dollar donors this campaign season, in favor of relying on small-dollar, online donations. The results have surprisingly seen them outraising other candidates last quarter.

Warren’s critics have slammed her for holding fundraisers in the past and using some of the money left in her war chest to launch her 2020 presidential bid. But since announcing her candidacy, Warren has not taken any PAC or big-dollar donations.

“I’m not going to take any contributions over $200 from executives at big tech companies, big banks, private equity firms, or hedge funds,” Warren wrote. “And when I’m the Democratic nominee for president, I’m not going to change a thing in how I run my campaign: No PACs. No federal lobbyists. No special access or call time with rich donors or big dollar fundraisers to underwrite my campaign.”

Despite outraising most other candidates last quarter, Warren’s rivals still say that the small-dollar donations will hinder her chances of defeating President Trump should she win the Democratic nomination.

“We're not going to beat him with pocket change,"" Buttigieg said in a Snapchat post, adding that Democrats ""need the full spectrum of support in order to compete.”"

Who, in the name of helping President Trump, would promote a video that depicts him as a maniacal murderer?

Politics is a rough game and I don’t shock easily, but this is so beyond the pale that it’s hard to grasp.

Now it’s important to say at the top that there’s no evidence the president knew about this. White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham tweeted that her boss hadn’t seen it, but “based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns” it.

Campaign officials also say they hadn’t seen it. So did Donald Trump Jr. and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, both of whom spoke at the conference, at Trump National Doral Miami, where it was played.

And the organizer for the conference, the pro-Trump group American Priority, denounced the video.

But a participant at the Miami conclave was concerned enough to use an intermediary to slip the footage to the New York Times.

Just to be clear, this is not one of the satiric videos that the president has retweeted, like the WWE-style one showing a Trump character body-slamming a guy with a CNN head.

WHITE HOUSE CONDEMNS FAKE VIDEO SHOWING TRUMP SHOOTING JOURNALISTS

“The most violent clip,” says the Times, “shows Mr. Trump’s head superimposed on the body of a man opening fire inside the ‘Church of Fake News’ on parishioners who have the faces of his critics or the logos of media organizations superimposed on their bodies.”

Here’s what happens:

“Many parishioners’ faces have been replaced with the logos of news media organizations, including PBS, NPR, Politico, The Washington Post and NBC.

Mr. Trump stops in the middle of the church, pulls a gun out of his suit jacket pocket and begins a graphic rampage. As the parishioners try to flee, the president fires at them. He shoots Black Lives Matter in the head, and also shoots Vice News.

“From there, Mr. Trump attacks a range of his critics. He strikes the late Arizona senator John McCain in the back of the neck. He hits the television personality Rosie O’Donnell in the face and then stabs her in the head. He strikes Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California. He lights the head of Senator Bernie Sanders, a Democratic presidential rival, on fire.

“He takes Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, hostage before throwing him to the ground. Then he strikes former President Barack Obama in the back and throws him against a wall. The clip ends with Mr. Trump putting a stake into the head of a person with a CNN logo for a face.”

Hilarious, no?

A CNN statement said, “Sadly, this is not the first time that supporters of the president have promoted violence against the media in a video…but it is by far and away the worst.”

The piece says parts of the video were posted on YouTube last year by a user with a record of creating pro-Trump mashups.

Put the targets aside for one minute. In this era of mass shootings, why would even the most rabid partisan want to promote video of a massacre? We’ve already endured actual massacres in a church, in South Carolina, and a synagogue, in Pittsburgh.

And we’ve already seen violent nutjobs target political and media figures, from the man who opened fire at a Republican baseball practice to the pipe bomber who mailed explosives to prominent Democrats and CNN.

I’ve been just as vociferous about a play, a video and other imagery (such as Kathy Griffin holding up a severed head) that portrays Trump as being killed. Griffin is murdered in the pro-Trump video and has denounced it.

The video seems indiscriminate in depicting other Trump targets, including not just Obama but Bill and Hillary Clinton, CBS, HuffPost, Mika Brzezinski, Adam Schiff and…Harvey Weinstein?

The conference organizer said the macabre video, apparently adapted from a dark comedic film from 2014, was shown as part of a “meme exhibit.”

Who on the planet thought this was a good idea to bring to a gathering with various Trump World luminaries?

Did those involved expect a standing ovation? Raucous laughter? An invitation to the White House?

We need to know more about who created this travesty, and people of every political stripe should condemn it."

Hunter Biden's business activities in Ukraine and China are the conversation Trump wants the public to have to distract from bigger political issues, Sanders told Martha MacCallum Tuesday on ""The Story.""

""This was absolutely Hunter's decision to do the interview,"" she said.

""Frankly, for three weeks, Hunter Biden has been the focus of attacks, lies -- and, frankly, smears -- unsubstantiated smears by the administration, Donald Trump himself and the Trump campaign.""

Just before the interview on ""The Story,"" host Martha MacCallum noted former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell -- a longtime ally of the Delaware senator -- said in retrospect Hunter should not have done the interview.

""I wouldn't have put Hunter on the air,"" Rendell told The Daily Beast.

MacCallum said the former Philadelphia mayor was also not alone as a Democrat in his reaction.

In response, Sanders reiterated throughout the interview that the campaign does not ""book the press"" for other members of the Biden family and that the 49-year-old acted on his own.

""This was completely his decision,"" she continued. ""Hunter spoke with conviction today. He was strong and forceful.""

In addition, she compared what she considered the younger Biden's straightforwardness with that of Trump and his circle.

""He answered every single question thrown at him,"" she said of Hunter. ""That is more than what we can say for Donald Trump and also Rudy Giuliani.""

Sanders continued, telling MacCallum it is Trump that brought Hunter Biden into the 2020 conversation.

""The only reason we're having this conversation is because Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani injected these lies and smears into the atmosphere and you know why they did it -- because Donald Trump is terrified of facing Vice President Biden in a general election.""

She pledged that if Biden wins in 2020, neither Hunter nor any other Biden family member will have offices in the West Wing, be sitting in on presidential-level meetings or the like -- pointing to members of Trump's family who are often seen in public with the president.

""I do believe I saw some criticism online about this from Donald Trump Jr. of all people,"" she said, claiming the first son is not someone, ""we should all look to as an example.""

She added that, in Tuesday's debate, she hoped Biden's fellow contenders will not make the conversation about things Trump wants Democrats to focus on.

""We hope that Democrats won't take the bait,"" she said."

BIDENS ACKNOWLEDGE ETHICS WOES

NYT: “Hunter Biden, whose overseas business dealings have drawn relentless attacks from President Trump and posed a threat to the candidacy of his father, Joseph R. Biden Jr., intends to step down from the board of a Chinese company, BHR, by the end of the month, his lawyer said on Sunday, a move his father later lauded in a forceful defense of his son’s integrity. The lawyer also said in a statement that if Mr. Biden were to be elected president, his son would ‘agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign-owned companies.’ The decision is the first action the pro-Biden camp has taken that appears to acknowledge the extent to which Hunter Biden’s business practices have created an untenable problem for his father’s 2020 campaign. With the fourth Democratic primary debate only two days away … Mr. Biden’s lower-polling Democratic rivals have suggested his son’s work overseas raises questions about conflict of interest.”



Rolls out ethics, campaign finance plan in reply - Reuters: “Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden would look to ban private money from federal elections, his campaign said on Monday in a plan for government ethics that doubled as an attack on President Donald Trump. … The former U.S. vice president is promising to match individual donations for elections with government funding, and to block cash from private sources. Biden would also establish a new commission to enforce anti-corruption laws, bar lobbying by foreign governments and require candidates to disclose their tax returns.”



Dems still hedging on Warren - NYT: “Senator Elizabeth Warren has built her following in part by taking pictures with thousands of voters deep into evening after campaign events, but her dinner audience [in Washington] one night last month was far smaller. And Ms. Warren’s guests were more interested in hearing, and politely challenging, her campaign pitch… Addressing a few dozen members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus at a Chinese restaurant a few blocks from the Capitol, she laid out her case… But just under a month since the family-style meal, the Massachusetts senator has the same small number of endorsements from congressional colleagues beyond her home state as she did beforehand: three. … [H]er growing crowd sizes, soaring fund-raising and surge to the top of a number of national and early-state polls only shine a brighter light on one of the most revealing elements of this primary: the widening gap between the preferences of many Democratic voters and the lawmakers who represent them.”



Trump said to still want Warren - Axios: “President Trump's allies still fear a general election matchup against a banged-up Joe Biden more than a run against an invigorated Elizabeth Warren, people close to the president tell Axios. Warren has surpassed Biden in some primary polls, seemingly helped by the early coverage of Trump's efforts to get Ukraine to investigate conspiracy theories involving Biden and his son Hunter. And a Fox News poll now shows Biden and Warren each would lead Trump, 50% to 40%. … Several advisers in Trumpworld told [Axios] that Warren is arguably a better candidate in terms of being quick on her feet and prepared on a debate stage. But those advisers say her liberal stances on some issues and her ‘likeability’ problem with segments of general election voters make her weaker against Trump than even a Biden hindered by gaffes, generational dissonances and a son with personal drama and a lobbying record.”



Sanders slams Warren as ‘capitalist’ - Fox News: “Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders … is seeking to cut into the support of his rival by dismissing her as a ‘capitalist.’ ‘There are differences between Elizabeth and myself,’ Sanders said during an interview Sunday on ABC’s ‘This Week.’ ‘Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.’ The comments come amid a rise in socialism in the Democratic Party, as candidates become more willing to openly embrace socialism over capitalism. It also follows polling showing that Democrats now view socialism more positively than they do capitalism. Last year, when asked if she was a capitalist, Warren reportedly said, ‘I am a capitalist to my bones.’ Sanders explained he is not a capitalist because he ‘will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary.’”

TIME OUT: BOOM

History: “[On this day 72 years ago] U.S. Air Force Captain Chuck Yeager becomes the first person to fly faster than the speed of sound. Yeager, born in Myra, West Virginia, in 1923, was a combat fighter during World War II and flew 64 missions over Europe. He shot down 13 German planes and was himself shot down over France, but he escaped capture with the assistance of the French Underground. After the war, he was among several volunteers chosen to test-fly the experimental X-1 rocket plane, built by the Bell Aircraft Company to explore the possibility of supersonic flight. … Yeager flew the X-1 over Rogers Dry Lake in Southern California. The X-1 was lifted to an altitude of 25,000 feet by a B-29 aircraft and then released through the bomb bay, rocketing to 40,000 feet and exceeding 662 miles per hour (the sound barrier at that altitude). The rocket plane, nicknamed ‘Glamorous Glennis,’ was designed with thin, unswept wings and a streamlined fuselage modeled after a .50-caliber bullet.”

AMBASSADOR LAYS UKRAINE CLAIMS OFF ON TRUMP

AP: “A U.S. ambassador is expected to tell Congress that his text message reassuring another envoy that there was no quid pro quo in their interactions with Ukraine was based solely on what President Donald Trump told him, according to a person familiar with his coming testimony in the impeachment probe. Gordon Sondland, Trump’s hand-picked ambassador to the European Union, is among administration officials being subpoenaed to appear on Capitol Hill this week against the wishes of the White House.”



Former top Russia aide talks, too - Politico: “President Donald Trump’s former top Russia aide arrived on Capitol Hill Monday to testify before House impeachment investigators, as Democrats accelerate efforts to unearth the facts of Rudy Giuliani’s shadow diplomacy with top Ukrainian officials. Democrats view Fiona Hill’s closed-door testimony as critical to their understanding of the extent to which Giuliani, the president’s personal attorney, bypassed official U.S. government channels by pressuring Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump’s possible opponent in the 2020 presidential election.”



Hairy situation: Inside the botched effort to hire Trey Gowdy - NYT: “For 24 hours last week, Trey Gowdy, the former South Carolina congressman best known for leading congressional investigations of Hillary Clinton, was the new face of President Trump’s outside legal defense and a symbol of a streamlined effort to respond to a fast-moving impeachment inquiry. A day later, the arrangement fell apart, with lobbying rules prohibiting Mr. Gowdy from starting until January, possibly after the inquiry is over. Now, according to two people familiar with events, Mr. Gowdy is never expected to join the team. And Trump advisers are back to square one, searching for a different lawyer.”



House impeachment roadmap shaping up - Axios: “Ahead of this week's subpoenas and depositions, new documents obtained by Axios show how Democrats are taking the impeachment inquiry in two tightly focused directions: Ukraine and obstruction of justice. Why it matters: There are new temptations for Democrats to broaden the scope of their inquiry after developments last week including President Trump's gift to Turkey, new questions about coordination with the Chinese over Hunter Biden, and the dramatic airport arrests of two of Rudy Giuliani's associates with Eastern European backgrounds and their indictments on campaign finance violations. But for now, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appears to be sticking with her instincts to keep the probe tight and as simple as possible for Americans to understand.”



RNC spends to tweak vulnerable House Dems on impeachment - McClatchy: “Republicans are planning to target Democrats in swing districts with a new round of ads on impeachment this week as lawmakers return from their fall recess. The Republican National Committee will spend $350,000 on a multi-media buy as part of a strategy that includes digital ads, text messages and phone calls starting Tuesday calling on Democratic House members to 'stop the madness.' The effort is primarily targeted at the 31 Democrats in districts President Donald Trump carried in 2016. ‘We’ll emphasize it’s time to move on,’ RNC spokesman Rick Gorka told McClatchy. ‘There are real issues they could be working on, anything but this.’ Rep. Lucy McBath, D-Georgia, who supports an impeachment inquiry, is one of the GOP targets.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Was Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch an Obama appointee or a Trump appointee? If she was a holdover from the Obama years doesn’t make a little bit of sense for Trump to do some housecleaning? From what I understand some Ambassador appointments are given to friends and people who do something (in the campaign) to help the president get into office.” – Mary Blanton, Alpharetta, Ga.



[Ed. note: There are all different kinds of ambassadors, Ms. Blanton. There are two main categories: political appointees and career diplomats. Among the “political” there are two broad groups: Positions of such import that presidents want trusted confidantes and loyalists. Then there are postings to places so safe and stable that they can be doled out to donors and key supporters as patronage plums. The divide on the “career” side is similar. Some are to places of little strategic importance but are so poor and/or remote that fat cats wouldn’t want to perch there. But many are to places where the work is just too sensitive to risk amateurism. Our ambassadors face terrible risks on a regular basis in places around the world where, but do so in service of crucial American goals. We want top people with deep knowledge of the language, culture and history of places like Iraq, Turkey and, yes, Ukraine, to serve in such posts. Yovanovitch is one of these folks. She was appointed to her former post by then-President Obama. But before that, George W. Bush appointed her to the strategically important former Soviet republics of Kyrgyzstan and Armenia.

“I would love to hear your reaction to the following idea: There should be a law that the federal government cannot tax any citizen at a rate in excess of 33 1/3%. This is to prevent any candidate from getting votes by simply suggesting that they will tax ‘the rich’ at 50%, 60% or 70%. Low income people are apt to vote for those candidates for the wrong reason. What say you?” – Ted Boers, Grand Rapids, Mich.



[Ed. note: I hear you, Mr. Boers, but you’d have to quickly come up with a LOT of additional dough. Rich people – the 40 percent of highest earners – pay something like 70 percent of all the taxes. If you knock down the two top tax rates – 37 percent and 35 percent – that would be a lot of money off the table. Leaving aside that practical consideration, there’s this one: You’d really need a constitutional amendment to do what you’re describing. It’s very hard to imagine getting supermajority support for something that would immediately be unpopular with the bottom 60 percent of earners. In the coming fiscal disasters awaiting America, we’re going to have some tough fights over taxes and spending – the very fights lawmakers have been pushing off for decades. It’s going to be ugly and weird and a number of proposals once considered unthinkable will suddenly sound mainstream. Fiscal conservatives would probably do better to get ready for that moment.]



“In quite deservedly praising Cardinal shortstop Paul DeJong you parenthetically asked ‘(whoever heard of a slugger shortstop?).’ Does the name Ernie (Let’s play two) Banks ring a bell? In the four years from 1957 through 1960 when he was the Cubs regular shortstop he hit 176 home runs (yearly average 44), leading the league twice. Over that same period, he drove in 491 runs (yearly average 123), again twice leading the league. He wasn’t just an offensive force, winning a Gold Glove for his defensive play in 1960. Additionally, he was the National League Most Valuable Player in both 1958 and 1959 despite playing for a sorry team that in both years finished fifth in an eight team league. So, to answer your question — I have, as have the many others who undoubtedly have written to point out your egregious error. (I still love you).” – Bob Foys, Chicago



[Ed. note: There’s always a Cubs fan out there! Always! You are quite right, Mr. Foys. Other than to a lesser degree Robin Yount and Derek Jeter, Banks is the cream of the power hitting shortstop crop. I’m including your note for two reasons: 1) Goodness knows Cubs fans need something to be cheerful about in October 2) Maybe this expression of goodwill will help snap the Cardinals out of their slough of despair against the Nats!]

Metro: “A rhino was filmed going for a walkabout in a crowded market. The animal casually strolled past liquor shops and clothes showrooms in Nepal as shocked members of the public looked on. What was probably more surprising is no-one seemed to be scared of the rhino, which had strayed from the popular Chitwan National Park. Some tourists were so comfortable they even took selfies with the large beast on Thursday. Shankar Kandu Ravi, 31, from Uttar Pradesh in India, followed the elusive animal for about ten minutes and then took a picture with it. … Mr. Ravi said the rhino even came face-to-face with a couple but didn’t attack anyone. He added: ‘It was just acting to scare the couple. It warned people to not come close.’ ‘Next morning, I had inquired about it and learnt that it returned to the jungle early in the morning.’”

Lions defensive back Tracy Walker was flagged for unnecessary roughness on a play in which he collided with Packers wide receiver Geronimo Allison. Walker said after the game he was just trying to go for the ball and described the call as “awful” – a word he would use multiple times to describe the officiating.

“Awful. It was an awful call,” he said, according to ESPN. “I felt like I went for the ball and [it] just so happened we collided, but I was looking for the ball. It was an awful call by them. It is what it is, though.”

Referee Clete Blakeman explained in the pool report that regardless of intent Walker’s helmet-to-helmet contact will always draw a penalty.

Walker, a second-year safety, expressed his frustrations to reporters with the referees after the Lions’ 23-22 loss to the Packers.

“Extremely pissed off right now,” Walker said. ""It is what it is. Disappointed. Hurt. We had that game. I'm going to say the same s—t. We should have won it. It is what it is, though. Got to bounce back.""

He added that even though there were some “awful calls,” he knows the team had to play through it.

Walker was asked if he cared whether he gets fined for his comments, he said he didn’t.

“Detroit vs. Everybody,” Walker said, according to the Detroit Free Press. “I’m saying it. Detroit vs. Everybody. It’s awful.”

Detroit defensive end Trey Flowers also had trouble with the officiating as he was flagged twice for illegal use of hands. According to ESPN, he explained exactly what he was doing.

“I actually changed the position of my hand, because it was to the chest initially,” Flowers said. “Which is right here. I was doing it all game. I didn't know that was a flag to the chest, so I could change it to [motioning somewhere else on his chest]. They called it again.”

Walker and Flowers’ frustrations were echoed by Hall of Fame running back Barry Sanders.

“That is sickening... the @NFL needs to look at a way to prevent that from happening. Two phantom hands to the face calls really hurts us tonight. Yes, we could have scored TDs, but @Lions played too well to have the game end this way,” Sanders wrote in a tweet.

Detroit was called for eight penalties for 50 yards. The Packers were also flagged six times for 48 yards.

“We all know we can’t have those penalties, whatever it was that caused those to take place,” Lions coach Matt Patricia said, according to the Detroit Free Press. “We’ll go back and take a look at it and make sure we’re coaching it better, make sure we’re doing the right things. Just can’t have them. We know how dangerous Aaron Rodgers is and how detrimental those penalties are.”"

* Bernie Sanders hasn’t picked up many congressional endorsements for his presidential campaign, but he’s now picking up two fairly high-profile backers: first-year Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).

* Joe Biden’s campaign appears to have a rather serious financial problem: as the 2020 race enters the next stage, the former vice president only had about $9 million cash on hand as of two weeks ago. In contrast, Bernie Sanders had $33.7 million in the bank, Elizabeth Warren had $25.7 million, Pete Buttigieg had $23.3 million, and Kamala Harris had $10.5 million.

* With only three weeks remaining in Kentucky’s gubernatorial race, the latest Mason-Dixon poll shows incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin (R) tied with state Attorney General Andy Beshear (D), with each garnering 46% support.

* On a related note, Bevin’s fate is reportedly of keen interest to the White House, and Team Trump is reportedly “planning an 11th-hour push to stave off an embarrassing defeat” for the far-right governor.

* And speaking of the Bluegrass State, a judge yesterday sided with the Kentucky Democratic Party and ordered State Board of Elections to keep 175,000 purged voters on the state’s voter rolls.

* In Maine., the latest survey from Public Policy Polling found Sen. Susan Collins (R) trailing a generic Democrat in next year’s U.S. Senate race, 41% to 44%. The incumbent Republican hasn’t yet officially declared whether she’ll run for another term.

* In a newly released audio recording, Texas state House Speaker Dennis Bonnen (R) is heard telling a far-right activist that Donald Trump is “killing” the party “in the urban-suburban districts.”

* And though the president’s GOP primary rivals stand no realistic chance of success, it seemed notable that a Franklin Pierce University-Boston Herald poll found former Gov. Bill Weld with 14% support in New Hampshire, up from 3% in the same poll last month."

305,Martin Longman,,"If Sanders or Warren were to become president, they'd struggle to pass the plans proposed by Biden and Buttigieg and be accused of Leninism for even trying.",2019-10-16,Google News,I Hate to Admit the Moderates are Right About Medicare-for-All,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/washingtonmonthly/rss/~3/YlsY_9EEgkw/,"Senate Democrats/Flickr

While there are some legitimate concerns that can be raised about Medicare-for-All on the merits—as opposed to on the politics—I am not convinced that it’s a problem that some people, like members of organized labor, have worked hard to negotiate good private health care plans. To me, this is a bit like arguing that we don’t need to eliminate Lyme disease because we can treat it with antibiotics. There is simply no value-added by having a profit or commercial basis to health insurance. If it is to exist at all, it should be strictly as a supplemental product.

But that’s an ideological opinion of mine and not a strategic analysis of what the Democrats should be pursuing on the health care front during the 2020 campaign. Watching the CNN debate on Tuesday night, I agreed with Warren and Sanders on the merits, but I thought the moderates had the better argument.

I have three concerns about pushing for Medicare-for-All right now. The first is that it’s obviously controversial and has big political vulnerabilities. Sanders freely admits that to pay for it will require taxes to go up on everybody who pays taxes, including the middle class. Warren is more reluctant to acknowledge this, although she doesn’t outright deny it. What they both argue, instead, is that overall costs will go down for the middle class because they will no longer have to pay premiums, co-pays, or out-of-pocket costs. This is most likely true in a general sense, although on an individual basis it might depend on how much health care someone uses in a given year. So, one problem lies in convincing people that a tax hike will benefit them, especially when it is not guaranteed that it will.

Another problem is the same one we see anytime health care reforms are proposed. People freak out about losing plans or access to doctors they like or having to wait in a queue to get treatment. This vulnerability isn’t avoidable or a good argument for not pursuing reforms but it does make it risky to propose something as disruptive as the abolishment of all private insurance. For me, this means that you should never propose something like this unless you’re serious about putting all your muscle behind it. And that gets to my third concern.

There is a basic cost-benefit error here. The chances of pushing a Medicare-for-All plan through the next Congress are almost nil. The Democrats would either have to overcome a Senate filibuster or they’d have to eliminate the legislative filibuster altogether. Let’s examine both of those scenarios.

The Democrats would need 60 votes to end a filibuster and they couldn’t get that many votes even if they won every competitive or semi-competitive Senate race next year. So, we can rule this out.

To end the legislative filibuster, they’d need 50 votes and the vice-president breaking a tie. But the Democrats will be lucky to have more than 51 or 52 seats even in a total landslide election. The problem here is that they’re unlikely to have enough unanimity in their caucus to end the legislative filibuster unless they can get closer to 55-57 seats. That’s both because senators are institutionally opposed to the change and because moderates get two valuable things out of the filibuster. First, it prevents radical legislation from passing which would endanger their political careers. Second, it puts them in the strongest negotiating position because they are the ones who can cut deals with Republicans (or so they like to think).

So, it’s not likely that the legislative filibuster will be eliminated by the next Congress. If it is, it will probably be after the first and most important year when even the moderates have to acknowledge that the rule is crippling their new president.

So, on a cost-benefit basis, there are easily identifiable downsides to proposing something that makes people apprehensive and that can be easily attacked and mischaracterized. What I can’t find is the upside. Where is the benefit in proposing something you won’t be able to enact?

And it’s not just the filibuster that makes it hard to enact. It’s also the lack of unanimity about it in the Democratic caucuses. I’m not at all certain that Nancy Pelosi could pass Medicare-for-All through the House. In the Senate, there could be a dozen or more Democratic senators who would never sign off on it. If the idea is to move the Overton Window to make Medicare-for-All more popular, that’s the job of a message candidate, not a candidate who plans on being the nominee.

This lack of unanimity was definitely on display during the debate last night when candidates like Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar all attacked Warren for proposing Medicare-for-All. That footage will be manna from heaven for Donald Trump or whoever runs in his stead next year. We can be angry about Democrats echoing Republican talking points, undermining support for Medicare-for-All, prattling about budget deficits, and giving ammunition to the GOP for the 2020 campaign. But we can also be angry that we have serious potential nominees who couldn’t predict these problems and avoid them.

What’s particularly annoying is that if Sanders or Warren were to become president, they’d probably struggle to pass the plans proposed by Biden and Buttigieg and be accused of Leninism for even trying. That’s the best they could hope to do, and they’d be exceeding my expectations if they succeeded. So, all this is is a big fat political weakness that has no discernible upside at all.

And I simply can’t understand why anyone would gift a person like Donald Trump something he can grab and beat them with. It’s dumb politics and for once the moderates have the better side of an argument."

""These jobs will be good-paying, union jobs with strong benefits and safety standards in steel and auto manufacturing, construction, energy efficiency retrofitting, coding and server farms, and renewable power plants,"" Sanders' plan read.

""We will also create millions of jobs in sustainable agriculture, engineering, a reimagined and expanded Civilian Conservation Corp, and preserving our public lands.""

Sanders' ambitious climate plan also included nationalizing the bulk of U.S. energy production and drastically reducing carbon emissions.

He has acknowledged that the effect of his plan would be widespread job losses in the energy industry and promised to provide a slew of public assistance measures to those individuals.

""This plan will prioritize the fossil fuel workers who have powered our economy for more than a century and who have too often been neglected by corporations and politicians,"" he said.

""We will guarantee five years of a worker’s current salary, housing assistance, job training, health care, pension support, and priority job placement for any displaced worker, as well as early retirement support for those who choose it or can no longer work."""

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. for president, a move that will boost Bernie’s chances of winning the Democratic Party’s presidential primary race while simultaneously crushing his chances of beating Donald Trump in the 2020 general election.

Ocasio-Cortez and Omar have won immense praise from virtually every corner of the mainstream press and among the most extreme leftists in the Democratic Party. Both have been key players in promoting the “Green New Deal,” the most economically dangerous policy proposal offered in modern American history. (Sanders cosponsored Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal resolution in the Senate earlier in 2019.)

Among other things, Comrade Ocasio-Cortez’s GND would have the country abandon all fossil fuels over just a 10 year period, eliminate air travel, kill cows to halt climate change, provide “free” college, impose a single-payer health care system, and create a federal jobs guarantee.

OCASIO-CORTEZ, OMAR, TLAIB TO ENDORSE BERNIE SANDERS

Or, put more simply, the Green New Deal would transform America’s economy into a government-managed socialist nightmare. No wonder Ocasio-Cortez likes Bernie so much!

The timing for an endorsement couldn’t be better for Sanders, whose campaign took a big hit two weeks ago after the 78-year-old senator experienced a heart attack that forced him temporarily off the trail and gave a big boost to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Warren enjoys a strong lead over Sanders in most polls and is seen as the primary challenger to former Vice President Joe Biden, who remains the front-runner.

Ocasio-Cortez and Omar’s endorsement of Sanders will likely help Bernie win greater support among young socialists and progressives in the primary race.

One of Sanders’ biggest campaign weaknesses has been that although he has all the necessary socialist credentials to win a primary race in the modern Democratic Party, he remains an old, wealthy, white guy trying to win a nomination in a party currently obsessed with identity politics.

Ocasio-Cortez, a charismatic 30-year-old Latina, and Omar, 38, one of the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress, will help to improve his image among those who seem to believe age and race are among the most important qualifications for the nation’s highest office.

But whatever help Ocasio-Cortez and Omar’s support will offer Sanders in the upcoming primaries, it will most assuredly be heavily outweighed by the significant political damage these endorsements will have during the general election. Among many American voters, including middle-of-the-road Democrats, Ocasio-Cortez and Omar are about as politically toxic as it gets. In fact, “toxic” is probably a big understatement; they’re the Chernobyl of modern American politics.

A poll conducted by Axios of white, likely 2020 general election voters, with less than two years of college education—a demographic Democrats need to do better with in 2020 than they did in 2016 to have any chance of defeating Trump, found that although recognition of Ocasio-Cortez and Omar was high, support for both young socialists was extremely low. Only 22 percent of those surveyed said they had a favorable view of AOC, and only 9 percent said they had a positive view of Omar. Yes, you read that correctly—just 9 percent.

Further only 18 percent of those surveyed said they had a favorable view of socialism, while nearly seven in ten said they disapprove of socialism.

In July, Axios reported a “top Democrat … invoiced in 2020 congressional races” indicated that the internal polling data conducted of AOC was so bad that it “could put the [House] majority at risk.”

Other polling data show Ocasio-Cortez’s popularity in the toilet with other demographics as well. A March Quinnipiac survey revealed only 23 percent of Americans had a positive view of Ocasio-Cortez. Even in her home state of New York, AOC’s support is lackluster. A survey released in August found only 41 percent of New Yorkers like Ocasio-Cortez, roughly the same percentage of Americans across the country who said they have a favorable view of the freshman congresswoman.

The data couldn’t be clearer: Americans don’t support Ocasio-Cortez and Omar’s radical vision for America, so why would Bernie want to tie this gigantic anchor around his neck? Answer: He’s getting increasingly more desperate now that Warren’s campaign has started to surge.

Right from the start, it was apparent that for either Warren or Sanders to beat Biden, it would likely be necessary that one of the two would need to drop out of the race sooner rather than later.

Both Sanders and Warren come from the same region of the country and enjoy significant support within the most radical, socialist wings of the Democratic Party. Although the far left has unquestionably hijacked the DNC, it’s possible there still aren’t enough socialists in the party to push either Sanders or Warren in front of Biden while the vote is divided. From now until the primaries, the goal for Sanders and Warren will continue to be to try to build enough support to convince the other to drop out.

But all this political maneuvering will come at great cost. In order for Democrats to beat President Trump, they’ll need to do what Hillary Clinton couldn’t: win in much of the Midwest, in places like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Endorsements from AOC and Omar might make that incredibly difficult task even more insurmountable for Sanders, who already faced an uphill battle with voters because of the unpopularity of socialism in America’s Heartland.

With each passing day, it’s becoming more apparent that the leading Democratic Party candidates are digging the 2020 hole deeper and deeper, a clear sign that they are totally out of touch with the views of most American communities. How many times will they have to lose elections before they realize that people in the Heartland don’t share the same vision for the future as people like AOC and Ilhan Omar?

Based on the current campaign cycle, it appears the answer is at least one more presidential election.

The line of questioning started with Sanders, I-Vt., who just returned to the campaign trail after suffering a heart attack earlier this month. The 78-year-old was asked how he could “reassure” Americans that he was up for the task.

“We are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I’m going to reassure the American people,” Sanders said while thanking voters, friends and fellow Democratic primary candidates for their support. “I’m so happy to be back here with you this evening.”

Next came Biden—whose age has been a topic of conversation and criticism over the past several months on the campaign trail. CNN’s Erin Burnett quoted former President Jimmy Carter, who said that he wouldn’t have been able to start a presidential term at the age of 80, and pressed Biden why he thinks he could handle the pressure.

“Because I watched it, I know what the job is, I’ve been engaged,” Biden, 76, said, adding that “one of the reasons” he is running for president is his age—and with that, comes “wisdom.”

“We need someone in office this time around who on day one, on the world stage, can command respect from world leaders and know exactly what needs to be done to get this country back on track,” he said. “That’s one of the reasons why I decided to run this time because I know what has to be done. I’ve done it before, I’ve been there.”

He added: “I will not need any on the job training.”

Biden, who has grappled with sustained critical media coverage of a string of gaffes on the campaign trail, then vowed to release his health records, along with his tax records, before the Iowa Caucuses in January—the first contest of the 2020 primary season.

“I’m the only guy who’s released anything up here,” he scoffed.

Warren, D-Mass., who is 70, brushed off her age, when asked to respond.

“I say I will outwork, out-organize, and outlast anyone and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with,” she said.

Meanwhile, President Trump, who is 73, has said he feels “young” and is ready for another term of his administration.

“I feel like a young man. I am a young, vibrant man,” Trump said in April.

Should Trump be re-elected, he would be 74 on Jan. 20, 2021—Inauguration Day. Should the presidency go to one of the elder Democrats in the field—Biden would be 78; Sanders would be 79; and Warren would be 71.

But the CNN and New York Times moderators shifted to the other end of the spectrum, pointing to Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, for her young age of 38.

“It’s not fair to ask these three about their health and their wellness,” she said of the questions to Biden, Sanders and Warren. “Who is fit to serve as commander-in-chief?”

Gabbard said that she was, and further challenged the moderators to ask every candidate on the stage about their age and health—a suggestion that was ignored."

“I think AOC should be far less concerned with really campaigning for Bernie Sanders. She should be worried about her own back because I think she’s going to have a more difficult time with re-election than she thinks,” Lahren said on “Fox & Friends.”

Fox News has learned that Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., will appear with Sanders on Saturday in Queens, N.Y., at a “Bernie’s Back” rally following the senator's recent heart procedure. Rep. Ihan Omar, D-Minn., will also endorse the candidate, Fox News confirmed.

OCASIO-CORTEZ, OMAR, TLAIB TO ENDORSE BERNIE SANDERS

CNN reported that Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., will endorse Sanders as well. It was not immediately clear if Omar and Tlaib will appear at Saturday's event.

That makes three members of the so-called “Squad” of far-left freshman members of Congress who are lining up behind Sanders for president.

""The fact that we're in a place in this country that we take any of those three seriously, let alone elect them to office, is also appalling to me,"" Lahren added.

The endorsements would be a significant blow to the campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who, like Sanders, has been representing the party’s progressive wing.

Word of the endorsements also followed Tuesday night’s Democratic debate in Ohio, where Warren was under attack from multiple candidates after rising in the polls in recent weeks.

Winning the OK of the “Squad” members was also viewed as crucial in attracting young voters, as the top three Democrats in the polls are all senior citizens — Sanders is 78, former Vice President Joe Biden is 76 and Warren is 70.

There was no indication that the fourth member of the Squad, Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., was ready to make an endorsement — either of Sanders or any other candidate.

Lahren said the endorsements are not shocking or important to the race.

""We know that they were going to endorse Bernie Sanders. They're all socialists. The bigger problem here is that that is actually happening in an election for president of the United States.""

The staffer, Matt Orfalea, had apologized Monday for some of the videos, including one that supposedly sexualized Martin Luther King’s “I Have a Dream” speech.

“When I was about 20 yrs old, I edited MLK audio, to expose how easily media can completely misrepresent reality. That intention has been clearly stated in the Youtube description for 10 years. It was supposed to be a ‘reminder that media on tv or the web can be edited to twist facts/reality.’ I am embarrassed to say it was also a pathetic attempt at comedy,” he wrote in a Medium post. “There was a time when the vulgar ridiculousness of the final product made me laugh. Looking back at it now makes me ill. I choose not to delete it only because I want to be fully transparent. I’m sincerely sorry I ever made it.”

Sanders Campaign Manager Faiz Shakir responded: “All initial job offers are contingent on the completion of a final review of a person’s record. That vetting process had not yet been completed. It’s clear some of Matt’s prior social media content does not reflect the campaign’s values. We accept his resignation.”

He added in his statement: “In addition to being labeled ‘racist’, I am now also under scrutiny for using the words ‘retarded’ and ‘gay’ in old videos. It’s not acceptable and I’m sorry for it.”

All of the 12 Democrats onstage in Westerville, Ohio, backed the ongoing impeachment inquiry against Trump. The debate marked the first time the candidates met since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's news conference last month at which she unilaterally declared the inquiry had begun -- a move that the White House has said is legally insufficient.

""Joe Biden continues to stumble and bumble through these debates. Bernie Sanders came in strong. Elizabeth Warren was treated as the frontrunner,"" McDaniel said.

“There are differences between Elizabeth and myself,” Sanders said on ABC’s “This Week.” “Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.”

The comments come amid a rise in socialism in the Democratic Party, as candidates become more willing to openly embrace socialism over capitalism. It also follows polling showing that Democrats now view socialism more positively than they do capitalism.

Last year, when asked if she was a capitalist, Warren reportedly said, ""I am a capitalist to my bones.""

But, that’s just the first of many factors that could make this showdown – the first in a month – stand out.

BERNIE SANDERS SLAMS ELIZABETH WARREN AS A 'CAPITALIST'

“Since the last Democratic debate, the presidential race has dramatically shifted. Tonight is the first major gathering since the opening of the impeachment inquiry,” former Democratic National Committee chair and Fox News contributor Donna Brazile said.

The debate also comes as Joe Biden lost his long-held status as the unrivaled front-runner. The former vice president suddenly has been neck-and-neck with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for the top spot in many of the recent national and early-voting-state polls. And, Biden was left in the dust in the race for campaign cash, with both Warren and fellow progressive champion Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont each topping him by roughly $10 million in the July-September third quarter of fundraising.

The showdown also comes two weeks after the 78-year old Sanders suffered a heart attack. The debate is set to mark his return to the campaign trail and with questions regarding his health and stamina, the independent senator making his second straight White House run will be under the microscope.

With all that in mind, here are eight things to watch at the debate.

Impeachment

The debate is the first held since House Democrats launched a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter over their dealings in the eastern European country. Fueled by whistleblower complaints and a transcript of the call released by the White House, Democrats argued the president was pressuring a foreign country to interfere in a U.S. election.

Adding to the controversy was the fact that before the phone call, millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been put on hold; it ultimately was released in September. Despite allegations that Trump was using that money as leverage, the president insisted repeatedly that he did nothing wrong. He said there was no “quid pro quo” and on numerous occasions has described his conversation with the Ukrainian leader as “perfect.”

While all the candidates on the stage supported impeaching the president, the impeachment inquiry clearly will overshadow the showdown -- but will it dominate the debate to the detriment of other top issues in the Democrats’ presidential nomination race?

“There is a real danger that the substance of the debate is limited by the impeachment inquiry,” warned veteran political scientist Wayne Lesperance, the vice president of academic affairs at New England College.

Biden and Biden

While only one Biden will be on the stage, another certainly will be part of the conversation. While the former vice president is expected to use impeachment to frame the race as a fight between himself and the Republican incumbent, he likely will face questions about his son just hours after Hunter Biden’s first public interview since the start of the Ukrainian controversy.

As the president has fought back against impeachment, he and his allies instead have tried to put the spotlight on the Bidens.

Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden – as vice president – pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – who had faced widespread accusations of overlooking corruption in his own office – later was dismissed.

Biden, defending his actions in Ukraine, said, “there’s no truth to [Trump's] charges and attacks against me and my son. Zero.”

Trump’s also repeatedly raised questions about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of a Chinese private equity firm. This past Sunday, Hunter Biden resigned from the company – and on Tuesday morning – just hours before the debate – broke his silence in an interview with ABC News’ “Good Morning America.""

The younger Biden maintained that he did nothing improper while he served on the board of the Ukrainian energy company. But he acknowledged that accepting the lucrative position was, in retrospect, ""poor judgment.""

Some of Biden’s lower-tier rivals, looking for a breakout moment, may be tempted to criticize him over the optics of having his son sit on the boards of foreign companies while he served as vice president. However, it may be a slippery slope, as none of the Democrats seeking to unseat Trump may want to play into his playbook of targeting the Bidens.

Sanders’ health

“I’m ready,” Sanders emphasized in an email to supporters on Monday.

While all the candidates will be under the spotlight, it will shine extra bright for Sanders, who would have a unique challenge in needing to showcase that he hasn’t lost a step, and quell concerns that he may not be up to speed.

Analysts pointed out Sanders would need to show strength and agility, but the question for his rivals would be whether it’s a fair game for them to raise concerns about his health. Questions were raised about the late Sen. John McCain’s medical condition during the 2008 campaign and about the health of both candidates four years ago.

Sanders vs. Warren

Aside from some sniping by some of his top advisors, Sanders has not criticized Warren, as she’s mostly passed him by in the polls the past two months.

That’s why his labeling of his friend and populist senator – who’s produced one progressive policy proposal after another – as a “capitalist” made so much news this weekend.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

“There are differences between Elizabeth and myself,” Sanders said during an interview Sunday on ABC News’ “This Week.” “Elizabeth, I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.”

Will Sanders continue to draw contrasts with the rising Warren at the debate?

A former Sanders adviser – who for months raised alarms that Warren, rather than Biden, was the real threat – said the drawing of distinctions may be a necessity.

“Unfortunately, it’s a sign of concern on the part of Bernie and his camp that Warren is beating him with the voters that he needs,” noted Kurt Ehrenberg, a top adviser for Sanders in New Hampshire and the 2016 and 2020 campaigns who recently parted ways with the campaign.

A more aggressive Biden?

The former vice president seemed to get a second wind last week during two speeches in New Hampshire, when Biden gave a full-throated thrashing of Trump as he called for the president’s impeachment for the first time. Will that aggressive style of campaigning continue on the debate stage in Ohio?

“One of the problems I’m finding, I’ve got to be more aggressive,” Biden acknowledged during a fundraiser late last week in California. “I’ve had some difficulties on knowing to counterattack.”

A senior Biden campaign adviser told Fox News hours before the debate that ""what you'll hear tonight from the VP is that first and foremost, we have to keep the focus on Donald Trump's unprecedented abuse of power.""

Back in the spotlight

Health care – specifically the intra-party battle over “Medicare-for-all,” immigration, race relations and other domestically focused issues – has dominated the discourse at the first three rounds of debates. Foreign policy mostly has been relegated to the garbage time late in the showdowns, when the number of viewers dwindled.

But, with Turkey’s attack on northern Syria, unfolding soon after the president’s move to withdraw U.S. troops who had been fighting alongside Kurdish forces against ISIS militants, questions about Trump’s record on the world stage could be back in the spotlight.

That may benefit the candidates with foreign policy experience. Besides the obvious – Biden – such a discussion could give the two veterans in the field who’ve served in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii – a moment to shine.

Looking for a breakout moment

The debate could provide the opportunity the mid-tier candidates have been seeking – a standout moment in front of millions of viewers with less than four months to go until the voting begins in Iowa. Buttigieg, Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas all have been looking to gain some traction and break up the narrative that the race has been a three-candidate contest between Biden, Warren, and Sanders.

So will businessman and billionaire environment and progressive activist Tom Steyer, who’s making his first appearance on the debate stage.

Buttigieg – in a likely tease of things to come – took aim at Warren and Sanders for proposing to scrap private insurance as he touted his Medicare-for-all-who-want-it plan a new digital ad hours before the debate.

“Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren believe that we have to force ourselves into Medicare for all, where private insurance is abolished,” the narrator says in the ad.

Unpredictable moments

Gabbard made headlines in the second round of debates in July when she took aim at Harris, firing away at the former California attorney general’s record as a prosecutor. Last week, she made headlines when she threatened to boycott the debate to protest the “rigging” of the debates and the race for the nomination by the Democratic National Committee and its media partners.

Gabbard announced Monday morning that she would take part in the debate after all, and her planned appearance – after failing to qualify for the September showdown – had analysts wondering what she had next up here sleeve.

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro also has been looking to make some news. Castro – whose attacks on Biden’s age and memory at the September debate backfired, according to many analysts – is set to appear on the stage for what could possibly be the last time.

With the thresholds rising for the November showdown, Castro made a fundraising pitch to supporters, telling them ""I refuse to let tonight be my last time on the debate stage.""

A big debate moment would give him a boost to reach the new qualifying criteria."

""I'm tired of hearing -- whenever I say these things -- 'oh, it's Republican talking points.' You are making Republican talking points right now in this room,"" Klobuchar said. She appeared to be referring to Warren's comments during a previous debate in which she accused the moderators of parroting Republican talking points by raising concerns about ""Medicare-for-all.""

Warren, D-Mass., has repeatedly refused to say whether she will raise taxes on the middle class. During Tuesday's debate, she maintained that she would lower costs for everyone except the wealthy and large corporations. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has similarly pledged to lower costs but disclosed that his plan would entail raising taxes.

PETE BUTTIGIEG RELEASES AD CRITICAL OF SANDERS' AND WARREN'S 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' HEALTH PLANS

Both Warren and Sanders have been at the forefront of pushing ""Medicare-for-all,"" a controversial and sweeping proposal that would effectively limit private health insurance. But Klobuchar suggested that Warren's plan was a ""pipe dream"" without naming specifics like tax increases.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg specifically called out Warren over this issue, arguing that she was taking away Americans' choice with her plan. Both he and Klobuchar instead pushed a public option.

Warren responded by arguing that Buttigieg's plan -- ""Medicare for all who want it"" -- would actually limit coverage to people who could afford it. She also shared several stories from the campaign trail of voters who went bankrupt because of medical costs.

Elizabeth Warren came under attack from all sides during Tuesday night's presidential debate, as former Vice President Joe Biden defiantly defended his son's business practices overseas and vehemently denied any wrongdoing.

All of the 12 Democrats onstage in Westerville, Ohio, meanwhile, backed the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Trump. In a sign of apparent disunity and hesitation among Democrats, though, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said only minutes before the debate began that there would be no vote on formally commencing the inquiry.

The debate marked the first time the candidates met since Pelosi's news conference last month at which she unilaterally declared the inquiry had begun -- a move that the White House has said is legally insufficient. The candidate lineup set a record for most politicians on a single debate stage, topping the 11 Republican candidates who assembled in 2016.

JOE BIDEN DEFENDS SON HUNTER'S UKRAINE WORK: 'MY SON DID NOTHING WRONG. I DID NOTHING WRONG'

""Sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that's the case with this impeachment inquiry,"" Warren, D-Mass., asserted at the outset of the debate, when asked why Congress should bother with the process given the impending election.

Biden has been at the top of the crowded field for months, but has come under withering assault from the White House concerning his son Hunter's lucrative overseas business dealings.

The elder Biden faced something of a timid confrontation over the issue during the debate, when CNN anchor and debate moderator Anderson Cooper broached the topic by stating, without evidence, that President Trump's accusations of misconduct by the Bidens were ""false.""

But Cooper pressed Joe Biden on Hunter's admission in a televised interview earlier in the day that he made a mistake by obtaining a lucrative role on the board of a Ukraine company, with no relevant expertise, while his father was vice president and handled Ukraine policy. (“I know I did nothing wrong at all. Was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is a swamp in many ways? Yeah,” the younger Biden said Tuesday morning.)

Joe Biden recently pledged that no members of his family would engage in foreign deals if he were to be elected president -- a tacit admission, Republicans said, of previous poor judgment or even wrongdoing.

""Look, my son's statement speaks for itself,"" Biden said. “My son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government which was to root out corruption in Ukraine, and that’s what we should be focusing on.”

Biden insisted he never discussed Ukraine matters with Hunter, although Hunter separately told The New Yorker magazine that the dealings had come up in one instance.

PROOF OF LINKS: FOX NEWS OBTAINS PHOTO SHOWING BIDENS GOLFING WITH UKRAINE EXEC, SEEMINGLY CONTRADICTING FORMER VP'S CLAIMS

He concluded: ""The fact of the matter is, this is about Trump's corruption. That's what we should be focused on.""

Later on, as the debate heated up, Biden remarked: “These debates are kinda crazy."" In a head-turning moment, he also stumbled over his words, saying wealthy individuals might be found ""clipping coupons in the stock market.""

Separately, asked about Trump's policy in Syria, Biden appeared to give an extended answer in which he meant to talk about Turkish President Recep Erdoğan -- but kept referencing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad instead.

HUNTER BIDEN BREAKS SILENCE ON HOW HE OBTAINED LUCRATIVE GIGS WITH NO RELEVANT EXPERTISE, BUT A VERY POWERFUL FATHER

Asked about his health toward the end of the debate, Biden vowed to release his medical records before the Iowa caucuses are held, and said his age (76) gives him ""wisdom.""

Hunter Biden obtained other high-paying board positions domestically and internationally, with no relevant expertise, while his father was a senator and vice president. For example, Hunter became an executive at the financial services company MBNA just two years after leaving law school. MBNA sources told Fox News this week that the company was trying to curry favor with Joe Biden, who was shepherding a bill favored by MBNA to passage in the Senate.

Meanwhile, Warren has climbed to co-front runner status but faces new questions about her dubious claims to Native American ancestry.

She was under attack from all sides at the debate for refusing to answer whether her ""Medicare for All"" plan would raise taxes for the middle class. Warren once again dodged the issue, insisting only that ""costs will go down"" for the middle class.

""I appreciate Elizabeth's work, but again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something you can actually get done,"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said to Warren. ""At least Bernie’s being honest here. ... I’m sorry, Elizabeth.”

“These debates are kinda crazy."" — Joe Biden

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg also lambasted Warren on health care: “Your signature is to have a plan for everything, except this,"" he said.

Buttigieg specifically knocked Warren for the nonanswer, saying her failure to offer a direct answer is ""why people are so frustrated with politicians"" and arguing that ""Medicare-for-All"" would ""unnecessarily divide this country.""

""We heard it tonight,"" Buttigieg said. ""A yes-or-no question that didn't get a yes-or-no answer."" He said he wanted a plan that could be summed up as ""Medicare-for-All"" if you choose it, not whether you want it or not.

Former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke also pressed Warren on the tax issue, to no avail. (Later on, O'Rourke had no answer when Cooper asked how he could confiscate Americans' firearms, given that the government has no way of knowing where the vast majority of AR-15s are located. He said only that he believes Americans ""will do the right thing"" voluntarily.)

Sen. Bernie Sanders, who wrote the ""Medicare-for-All"" legislation that Warren has embraced, said it was ""appropriate to acknowledge taxes will go up.""

Sanders, who Fox News has confirmed will soon be endorsed by New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, also spoke about his recent heart attack: “But let me take this moment, if I might, to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes. ... And I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and I'm so happy to be back here with you this evening.”

Also during the debate, Democrats also piled onto Warren for her signature proposal, a 2 percent wealth tax to raise the trillions needed for many of her ambitious proposals. Technology entrepreneur Andrew Yang noted that such a measure has failed in almost every European country where it's been tried.

The event, hosted by CNN and The New York Times, was on the campus of Otterbein University, just outside Columbus in Ohio, a state that has long helped decide presidential elections but has drifted away from Democrats in recent years.

Many of the candidates were struggling just to get noticed — trying to make up ground in a race that kicks off officially in just over three months with the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3. Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., are trying to crack the top tier.

In one possible indicator the debate was a lengthy one, Harris briefly mentioned her proposal to have Twitter take Trump's account down, and demanded that Warren explain why she felt that approach was unwise. Warren, who last week laughed openly when informed by a reporter of Harris' idea, responded that she wants Trump out of the White House, not just banned from Twitter.

Progressives and right-wing commentators alike were aghast at Harris' decision to again bring up the unrealistic and unpopular idea of somehow suspending Trump from Twitter.

""I cannot believe @KamalaHarris is pushing this suspend Donald Trump's twitter account bullshit at a presidential debate,"" former Obama administration official and Pod Save America cohost Tommy Vietor wrote on Twitter. ""It's so small ball. She is bigger and better than this.""

Fellow Obama administration alumnus and podcast host Ben Rhodes added: ""Seems like there are bigger issues in the world.""

Also debating were Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Obama housing chief Julián Castro and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. Making his debate debut — and likely angling for a splash — was billionaire activist Tom Steyer.

Gabbard hit The New York Times and CNN for waging what she called a propaganda campaign against her, while also promoting endless ""regime-change wars.""

""The New York Times and CNN have smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war,"" Gabbard said. ""Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist, and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.""

Gabbard has criticized Trump for how he's conducted the withdrawal in Syria, but said Tuesday that while Trump has ""the blood of the Kurds on his hands. ... So do many of the politicians in both parties who supported this regime change war.""

Gabbard, who was one of the last Democratic House members to back an impeachment inquiry, additionally lamented that some Democrats had been calling for Trump's impeachment since right after the 2016 election, undermining the party's case against him.

The debate's foreign policy discussion concluded without any mention by the moderators of the ongoing push by China to censor American companies, including the NBA and Blizzard Entertainment, from making or tolerating pro-Hong Kong statements. Buttigieg briefly mentioned that the Hong Kong protests were not receiving support from the White House.

Yang's plan for a universal basic income spurred a discussion onstage concerning whether a federal jobs guarantee is a better plan -- something of a remarkable achievement for Yang, who has struggled in the polls while advancing his own unique agenda.

On abortion, the Democrats agreed they would support a federal law ""codifying"" the Supreme Court's holding in Roe v. Wade, which found a constitutional right to abortion, as a kind of defense in case the Supreme Court overturned Roe. At the same time, Biden emphasized he would not support ""court packing,"" or passing a federal law to expand the size of the Supreme Court to load it with Democratic justices.

Buttigieg then said he did not support court packing, but wanted ""reforms"" to make the court less significant -- including possibly a ""fifteen member court, where five of the members can only be appointed by unanimous agreement of the other ten."" A similar idea was being debated in the Yale Law Journal, Buttigieg said, in a shout-out to the left-wing student publication.

Gabbard said that Democrats were right decades ago when they said abortion should be ""safe, legal, and rare"" -- highlighting a shift to the left among Democrats.

The 2020 field, which once had swelled to two dozen, has been shrinking as the Democratic Party's rules have mandated that candidates meet higher donor and fundraising thresholds to debate.

Just 10 White House contenders qualified for September's debate, but Gabbard and Steyer made Tuesday's lineup a record.

Earlier contests featuring 20 candidates were divided between two nights.

Even during the heated exchanges over health care and a wealth tax, Warren was able to turn attacks leveled against her around, and still deliver the best answers of the evening.

Warren questioned why the other candidates “think it is more important to protect billionaires than to invest in Americans” when responding to an attack on her plan for a wealth tax.

And importantly, Warren remained the focal point of the debate, speaking for the most amount of time of all of the candidates.

The senator from Massachusetts now has unmatched fundraising and polling momentum, along with a series of strong debate performances. This, coupled with the fact that Biden and Sanders have been weakened in dissimilar but debilitating ways recently, almost guarantees that Warren will take over as the front-runner.

SURPRISE WINNER: Bernie Sanders

Sanders has faced a precipitous decline in the most recent polls given the significant questions about his health and stamina following his recent heart attack.

However, Sanders delivered a strong, forceful performance in the debate, succeeding in showing voters that he has not lost a step, making him the second-place finisher of the night.

But it is clear that Warren has supplanted Sanders as the leader of the progressive movement in the Democratic field. As a result, it will be difficult – if not impossible – for Sanders to reestablish himself ahead of Warren.

It is clear that Warren has supplanted Sanders as the leader of the progressive movement in the Democratic field. As a result, it will be difficult – if not impossible – for Sanders to reestablish himself ahead of Warren.

SURPRISE WINNER: Pete Buttigieg

Buttigieg has been called the breakout star of the Democratic field – though he has recently struggled to distinguish himself. He had several strong moments in the Tuesday night debate. He was able to make a compelling case as a young, center-left candidate from a swing state with a military background.

Buttigieg was particularly strong during a tense exchange with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii over President Trump’s decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria, delivering a response that elicited cheers from the audience.

“Respectfully congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong,” the mayor said. “The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it's a consequence of a withdrawal and betrayal by this president of American allies and American values.”

Ultimately, Buttigieg’s performance will likely result in a post-debate polling bump with moderate voters, especially given Biden’s relatively weak debate performance.

LOSERS

BIGGEST LOSER: Joe Biden

All eyes, particularly those of Democratic leaders, strategists, and donors were on Biden, who needed deliver a strong performance to reassure voters that he is ready for a general election fight against Trump.

However, Biden was unable to break through and deliver the forceful showing that he needed, dodging a question regarding his son’s work with Ukraine and delivering several other uneven answers throughout the night.

With each passing day, Biden seems to move further from securing the Democratic presidential nomination, and his unimpressive performance Tuesday night will likely result in a post-debate polling decline.

LOSER: Amy Klobuchar

Additionally, although Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota had a number of well-executed lines taking aim at Warren, many felt similar to the inconsequential attacks leveled against Warren by former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland during the first debate. Thus, Klobuchar’s performance is unlikely to result in the post-debate polling spike her campaign needed.

LOSER: Kamala Harris

Sen. Kamala Harris of California similarly fell short, as she failed to distinguish herself in any meaningful way at a time when her campaign desperately needs a boost. Given that recent polls have her hoovering at around 5 percent, she will likely not be able to regain the momentum she had just over two months ago.

LOSERS: Gabbard, Castro, Steyer, Booker, O’Rourke and Yang

The remaining candidates – all barely registering in polls – were the biggest losers of the night. Rep. Gabbard, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, philanthropist Tom Steyer, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas and entrepreneur Andrew Yang failed to have the breakout moment they all desperately needed to show voters they could defeat Trump in November 2020.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg has released a 2020 campaign ad taking shots at ""Medicare-for-all"" proponents in the Democratic field, arguing that his health plan offers more freedom by letting people keep their private insurance.

The ad, released on Monday night, featured clips of multiple commentators supporting his ""Medicare-for-all who want it"" plan. ""Mayor Pete said a 'Medicare-for-all who want it.' That seems like a much better formulation -- working towards a universal health care system but it doesn't wipe out private insurance,"" CNN commentator Van Jones says in the ad.

The video was released on day before Tuesday's fourth Democratic debate, likely an indication that Buttigieg would try and go on offense against ""Medicare-for-all"" proponents like Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.

Previous Democratic debates have tended to focus on health care, which seems to be one of the primary sources of infighting among leading 2020 candidates. Former Vice President Joe Biden has borne the brunt of the criticism due to his desire to build on the Affordable Care Act enacted by former President Obama.

PETE BUTTIGIEG PROPOSES PUBLIC OPTION, SAYS IT COULD 'NATURALLY' LEAD TO 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

It's unclear how Buttigieg will address Biden but his ad mentioned Warren and Sanders by name. The spot claims that they want to abolish private insurance and suggests that labor unions might oppose Medicare for all because it would erase the previous gains they made in fighting for insurance.

Buttigieg's health plan offers a public option that includes automatic and retroactive enrollment for anyone without a private plan.

It's unclear how long Americans could maintain their private insurance under Buttigieg's plan, though, as he's already reinforced conservative fears about a public option providing unfair and ultimately destructive competition for private companies.

""If private insurers are unable or unwilling to offer better plans than they do today, competition from this public alternative will naturally lead to Medicare-for-all,"" he wrote in a Washington Post op-ed announcing the plan last month."

The Boston Herald-Franklin Pierce University survey, released on Monday, indicated a three-way tie for the top spot in New Hampshire — with Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 25 percent support, former Vice President Joe Biden at 24 percent, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 22 percent.

But, if Obama hypothetically jumped into the race, the poll suggested she would grab 26 percent support of likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State, with Warren and Biden at 20 percent and Sanders at 15 percent.

The former first lady has resisted a flood of calls for her to declare her candidacy.

Elizabeth Warren during the most recent Democratic presidential debate Tuesday for going too easy on big corporations.

The “Fahrenheit 9/11” filmmaker, 65, was tweeting during the event when something the 70-year-old presidential candidate said caught his attention. Warren explained that she has a plan to combat corporations only caring about their bottom line that she calls “accountable capitalism.”

In short, the plan calls on companies to be held accountable to their employees and their local communities rather than just shareholders. Moore, who has an estimated net worth of $50 million and who Business Insider previously reported has nine homes, is typically known for his left-leaning point of view. He took issue with Warren’s plan in that it doesn’t do enough to dismantle capitalism.

“Senator Warren (whom I love) just said she believes in ‘accountable capitalism,’” Moore tweeted Tuesday. “There is no such thing. The only thing capitalism is accountable to is weath [sic] and more wealth for the wealthy. It’s only mission is to economically enslave the citizenry so the rich can get richer.”

The “Bowling for Columbine” director also took jabs at former Vice President Joe Biden, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg for their respective stances on healthcare at the debate.

“Joe Biden, Amy K and Pete B just boosted the Republican chances of winning in November 2020 by their passionate defense of the for-profit, capitalist-greed health ‘care’ system,” he tweeted.

The only one that appeared safe from Moore’s taunts was Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Sanders returned to the campaign trail after suffering a heart attack earlier this month. The 78-year-old was asked at the debate how he could “reassure” Americans that he was up for the task.

PETE BUTTIGIEG RELEASES AD CRITICAL OF SANDERS' AND WARREN'S 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' HEALTH PLANS

Rising in polls and facing increased scrutiny, Sen. Elizabeth Warren came under attack from two of her Democratic presidential nomination rivals at Tuesday night’s primary debate over her refusal to discuss whether taxes would go up for Americans to implement her proposal for a government-run ""Medicare-for-all"" plan.

Warren, D-Mass., has repeatedly refused to say whether she will raise taxes on the middle class. During Tuesday's debate, she maintained that she would lower costs for everyone except the wealthy and large corporations. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has similarly pledged to lower costs but disclosed that his plan would entail raising taxes.

Challenging night for Warren: Dems attack her on debate stage, then ‘Squad’ backs Sanders

Tuesday was arguably a bad night for rising Democratic presidential co-frontrunner Sen. Elizabeth Warren. She came under attack from all sides during Tuesday night's presidential debate and then reports surfaced that members of “The Squad” were set to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for president. Several of the candidates during the debate in Westerville, Ohio, criticized Warren for refusing to answer whether her ""Medicare for All"" plan would raise taxes for the middle class. Warren once again dodged the issue, insisting only that ""costs will go down"" for the middle class. Click here for more on this story.

But perhaps the most disheartening news for Warren came after the debate. Reports said that at least three members of the “Squad” of far-left freshman members of Congress will endorse Sanders for president. Fox News has learned that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., will appear with Sanders on Saturday in Queens, N.Y., at a “Bernie’s Back” rally designed to generate excitement for the senator’s campaign following his recent heart attack. Rep. Ihan Omar, D-Minn., issued a statement confirming her endorsement, and CNN reported that Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., will endorse Sanders as well. It was not immediately clear if Squad member Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., will endorse a candidate soon.

Biden insists he and son Hunter did nothing wrong, focus should be on Trump corruption

During Tuesday’s debate Vice President Joe Biden defiantly defended his son's business practices overseas and vehemently denied any wrongdoing. Biden had been at the top of the crowded field for months but has come under withering assault from the White House concerning his son Hunter's lucrative overseas business dealings.

CNN anchor Anderson Cooper pressed Joe Biden on Hunter's admission in a televised interview earlier in the day that he made a mistake by obtaining a lucrative role on the board of a Ukraine company, with no relevant expertise, while his father was vice president and handled Ukraine policy. Ultimately, the elder Biden insisted neither he nor Hunter did anything wrong and that the focus should be on President Trump. ""The fact of the matter is, this is about Trump's corruption. That's what we should be focused on,"" he said. Click here for more on this story.

Other highlights in the debate: All of the 12 Democrats onstage backed the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Trump. In a sign of apparent disunity and hesitation among Democrats, though, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said only minutes before the debate began that there would be no vote on formally commencing the inquiry.

Sanders stood by his claim that he would provide jobs for every single American -- ""tens of millions of Americans"" - purportedly ending unemployment in the United States. Biden, Warren, and Sanders -- who is recovering from a heart attack two weeks ago -- all faced pointed questions about their age, and health and how those factors could affect their electability and potential presidency.

The simmering bad blood between rivals South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas appeared to boil over as they continued to jab at each other. At one point, Buttigieg, who has said that O’Rourke’s gun buyback proposal could hurt Democrats appeal with moderate voters, firmly told O'Rourke: “I don’t need lessons from you on courage.”

CNN and The New York Times were widely criticized for not asking any of the 12 Democratic candidates about China during Tuesday night's presidential debate. China has made making major headlines in recent weeks between its trade war with the United States as well as the growing tensions between the communist nation and the NBA after the Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey made a tweet in support of the Hong Kong protesters.

Doug Schoen: The fourth Democratic debate's big winner, biggest loser and two surprise showings

According to Doug Schoen, a Fox News contributor and veteran Democratic pollster and consultant, Elizabeth Warren was still the big winner in the most crowded presidential debate ever held. In his analysis for Fox News Digital, Schoen said Warren showed she was sharp and prepared as she fended off attacks from candidates who were looking to cut into her polling lead -- and that only solidified her frontrunner status.

The biggest loser, according to Schoen, was Joe Biden, who needed to deliver a strong performance to reassure voters that he is ready for a general election fight against Trump. However, Schoen wrote, Biden was unable to break through and deliver the forceful showing that he needed, dodging a question regarding his son’s work with Ukraine and delivering several other uneven answers throughout the night.

Sen. Bernie Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Schoen said, were two surprise winners for delivering strong performances. Click here for more of Schoen's winners and losers from Tuesday's Democratic debate.

“For Senator Warren, the third straight time essentially tied at the top is the charm,” Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy emphasized. “Her candidacy clearly has staying power going into the debate.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont stood at 11 percent, with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent and Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 4 percent.

Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang and billionaire environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer each registered at 2 percent in the poll. The other candidates in the shrinking – but still large – field of contenders stood at 1 percent or less.

Quinnipiac’s survey differed from a Fox News poll released last week that indicated Biden at 32 percent, with Warren ten points back at 22 percent and Sanders at 17 percent. No other candidate cracked double digits in the Fox News survey.

THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL IN THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

Twelve candidates qualified for Tuesday’s debate, which is set to be held at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. They are – in alphabetical order – Biden, Booker, Buttigieg, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Harris, Klobuchar, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, Sanders, Steyer, Warren and Yang.

While national primary horserace polls have grabbed plenty of attention, the battle for the nomination is a fight for the states and their delegates. And, a new poll in New Hampshire, the state holding the first presidential primary, indicated a three-way tie at the top.

Warren stood at 25 percent support among likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State in a Boston Herald-Franklin Pierce University survey, with Biden at 24 percent and Sanders at 22 percent. Buttigieg stood at 9 percent and Harris at 5 percent, with no one else in the field topping 2 percent.

In New Hampshire’s Republican presidential contest, President Trump remained the overwhelming favorite against three extreme long-shot primary challengers, but his support has deteriorated from 88 percent a month ago to 71 percent in the survey. One of the primary challengers, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, saw his support jump from 3 percent in early September to 14 percent in the new survey.

The Boston Herald-Franklin Pierce University poll was conducted Oct. 9-13, with 422 likely Democratic primary voters and 405 likely Republican primary voters in New Hampshire questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of error was plus or minus 4.8 percentage points for Democratic primary questions and plus or minus 4.9 percentage points for GOP primary questions.

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted October 11-13, with 1,195 self-identified registered voters nationwide questioned by live telephone operators. The survey included 505 Democratic voters and independent voters leaning Democratic with a margin of error of plus or minus 5.3 percentage points."

Elizabeth Warren came under attack from two of her Democratic presidential nomination rivals at Tuesday night’s primary debate over her refusal to discuss whether taxes would go up for Americans to implement her proposal for a government-run Medicare-for-all plan.

After being asked by the moderators early at the fourth-round debate at Otterbein University whether middle-class taxes would rise under her health care proposal, the progressive senator from Massachusetts didn’t specifically answer, instead pledging that “I will not sign a bill into law that does not cut costs for middle-class families.”

Moments later, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg took aim at Warren, who’s soared in polling in recent months and is now considered a frontrunner for the party's presidential nomination alongside former Vice President Joe Biden.

Accusing Warren of being evasive, Buttigieg argued that “your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything— except for this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multitrillion-dollar hole in this Medicare-for-all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.”

Buttigieg then touted his plan for “Medicare-for-all-who-want it,” which, unlike the Medicare-for-all proposal championed by Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, would not eliminate private insurance.

Warren, firing back at Buttigieg, said: “Let’s be clear, whenever someone hears the term 'Medicare for all who want it,' understand what that means: It’s 'Medicare for all who can afford it.' And that’s the problem we’ve got. Medicare-for-all is the gold standard.”

But Mayor Pete counterpunched: “I don’t understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans, kicking 150 million Americans off of their insurance in four short years.”

DEMOCRATS UNITE IN IMPEACHING TRUMP AT TOP OF TUESDAY'S DEMOCRATIC DEBATE, AS BIDEN DEFENDS SON

Sanders, who authored the Medicare-for-all bill in the Senate, chimed in, noting that “as somebody who wrote the damn bill, as I say, let’s be clear, under the Medicare-for-all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone. Deductibles are gone. All out-of-pocket expenses are gone.""



But then he said “it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up” before adding that “for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.”

Asked again by the moderators if she would acknowledge what Sanders had just said, that middle-class taxes would rise, Warren answered, “What I have committed to is that costs will go down for hard-working middle-class families.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar then joined Buttigieg in calling out Warren.

The Minnesota Democrat said that “at least Bernie’s being honest here in saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes will go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.”

Suggesting that Warren would never be able to pass her Medicare-for-all plan through Congress, Klobuchar said ""the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done.""

Biden also chimed in, jabbing at Warren without naming her, accusing her of not being straightforward.

""On the single most important thing facing the American public, I think it's awfully important to be straightforward with them,"" Biden noted. ""The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget.""

And he charged that under the Sanders and Warren plan, ""if a fireman and a schoolteacher are making $100,000 a year, their taxes are going to go up about $10,000. That is more than they will possibly save on this health care plan. We have a plan put forward that will work."""

Given Joe Biden’s refusal to do any interviews since impeachment cast a spotlight on his family’s conduct, it was striking that he handed the ball to his son before the one forum where he couldn’t duck questions: the CNN/New York Times marathon.

And 17 minutes into the Ohio debate, when Anderson Cooper asked Biden the question, he retreated to “my son’s statement speaks for itself”—precisely the point of orchestrating the ABC interview.

JOE BIDEN DEFENDS SON HUNTER'S UKRAINE WORK: 'MY SON DID NOTHING WRONG. I DID NOTHING WRONG'

Cooper asked a key question: If Hunter Biden now says he won’t do any foreign work if his dad becomes president, why was it okay when Joe was vice president?

Biden ignored that, saying “my son did nothing wrong, I did nothing wrong,” then pivoted to denouncing Rudy Giuliani, President Trump and his “thugs” as liars. He would not acknowledge the lousy optics that even Hunter conceded.

The striking aftermath: None of the other Democrats on the stage said a negative word about Biden or his son’s lucrative deal in Ukraine. They deemed it off limits. Cory Booker defended Biden, saying no one should be “attacking a statesman.”

But Cooper also softened the question by saying “the president has made false accusations against your son” and “there is no evidence of wrongdoing by you and your son.” Why not let Biden make that case? Why appear to take sides? And is there absolutely no wrongdoing by Hunter, who was unqualified for the Ukrainian gas gig, as opposed to no evidence of criminal wrongdoing?

The only real action was on health care, though it wasn’t as exciting as the Washington Nationals scoring seven first-inning runs on their way to the World Series. In fact, that part of the debate seemed more like an old replay.

Once again, a journalist—in this case Marc Lacey of the Times—asked Elizabeth Warren if the middle class would pay more under the Medicare for All measure she is pushing.

Once again, Warren rolled out her standard response: The rich and big corporations will pay more, the middle class will pay less.

Lacey followed up—will you raise middle-class taxes?—and once again, the Massachusetts senator sidestepped: “I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.” Notice she said costs, not taxes. (Bernie Sanders, who wrote the damn bill, admits middle-class taxes will rise.)

Pete Buttigieg was more blunt, saying Warren had failed to answer a yes or no question. She dodged it again.

Amy Klobuchar, showing unusual aggressiveness, said Warren would kick 150 million Americans off their private insurance. I don’t know why the debate questioners don’t focus on this rather crucial point.

Biden said what he said in the last debate, that Medicare for All would cost $30 trillion over a decade and taxes would go up, but his rejoinder had less force.

After that, the debate settled into something of a wonkfest. What about auto jobs? Should there be a wealth tax? Can gun buybacks work? CNN’s practice of usually letting each of the 12 candidates answer the same question added to the drone factor.

Something else was at work. It’s now clear that the race has settled into a contest between Biden and Warren, with Sanders (looking vigorous despite his heart attack) continuing to slip. Everyone else has been mired in single digits for many months. So there’s far less media excitement if Kamala Harris has a strong moment or Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke get into a spat on gun control. Impeachment dominated the pregame programming, with the debate a secondary story.

The moderators, who included Erin Burnett, were fine, but could have done far more to sharpen the contrasts between the contenders.

On Trump’s pullout from northern Syria, Biden was strikingly emotional, saying of the Kurds: “They lost their lives. This is shameful, shameful, what this man has done!” Warren accused Trump of giving ISIS a new lease on life. Buttigieg called it a “betrayal.” The only dissenter was Tulsi Gabbard, who wants to end the ""endless war"" and accused CNN and the Times of smearing her.

But such brief fireworks were the exception, and that was the weakness of the debate. Far too much time was spent on the candidates denouncing Trump in unison, sometimes just changing the adjectives. That undoubtedly made Democratic viewers feel good, but did little to distinguish among the contenders.

That pattern began at the outset, when Cooper asked about impeachment. While he tried mixing up the questions—why not let the voters evict Trump instead, is impeachment a distraction?—every Democrat on the stage competed to castigate the president in stronger terms (Bernie won with “most corrupt in history""). Biden and Warren talked about the Mueller report, making clear that they were primed for impeachment before the Ukraine mess surfaced.

The only real change from the last three debates was that Biden briefly had to defend his son’s buckraking in Ukraine. Impeachment has frozen the race, and that’s bad news for anyone not named Joe or Elizabeth."

Dan Crenshaw, the freshman Republican congressman from Texas, defended himself Tuesday after a video showed an Illinois Democrat calling him “a racist.”

The Democrat, Rep. Sean Casten, an Irish-born lawmaker whose district covers suburbs west of Chicago, told an audience earlier this month that Crenshaw was “a racist” because the Texan proposed an amendment in Congress to prevent illegal immigrants from voting.

“The last amendment on the floor that day … came from Dan Crenshaw, the new Republican, the Navy SEAL with the eyepatch,"" Casten said, according to the Washington Free Beacon. Crenshaw is a former Navy SEAL who was wounded in combat in Afghanistan.

“He came up with an amendment to say, ‘We're going to add a rider on this bill that says that illegals can't vote.' And I sat there and I said, ‘You know what? You're not allowed to vote if you're not a citizen.’ … Why are you doing that?"" Casten continued. ""The reason you're doing that is because you are a racist. Because you are trying to appeal to people who will vote for you if you stand up and oppose brown people,"" he said.

Crenshaw responded on Twitter after video from Casten’s Oct. 5 remarks surfaced.

“When you can’t articulate a coherent argument, you resort to calling your political opponents racist,” Crenshaw wrote on Tuesday. “Can’t say I’m surprised. Just another day in Washington with the Democrat Party.”

Later, in a statement to the Free Beacon, a Crenshaw spokeswoman added: “If Rep. Casten is so deeply offended that our laws prohibit non-citizens from voting in federal elections, then he should be honest with his constituents and let them know how little he values the power of their vote.”

In a party-line vote, the Democrat-controlled House defeated Crenshaw’s proposal, the outlet reported.

Casten also made headlines in June when he came out in support of the impeachment effort against President Trump.

The Democrat also drew criticism last year when he said Trump and 9/11 mastermind Usama bin Laden “have a tremendous amount in common.”

Crenshaw, during a September appearance on Fox & Friends, accused Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders of deliberately tweeting about veterans issues in order to “make people angry.”"

The freshman congresswoman is getting her very own action figure as part of a series of political toys created by a Brooklyn-based design company.

The company, FCTRY, showcased its ""AOC"" doll design through an online fundraising site, asking supporters to help finance its product along with other political action figures. The fundraiser started on Tuesday but has already surpassed its goal of $15,000, which it hoped to achieve by mid-November.

As of Tuesday afternoon, the campaign had nearly 800 backers and more than $20,000 in donations.

AOC GETS CHOKED UP AT CLIMATE FORUM: 'MY DREAMS OF MOTHERHOOD ARE NOW BITTERSWEET'

""We're toymakers, not prophets, so take what we say with a grain of salt,"" the company said. ""But we've got a pretty good track record of spotting real-life heroes in the making and from where we sit, AOC has the makings of a legend. So we're doing what we do best and turning her into an action figure.""

A promotional video debuts the ""AOC"" toy with a series of cheers describing her as a model feminist, activist and Democrat. ""Tell me what a role model looks like. This is what a role model looks like,"" voices on the video say in a call-and-response fashion typical of street protests.

FCTRY also displays infographics detailing the congresswoman's rise to prominence and touting her activism.

""Just two years ago, AOC was an anonymous 20-something waiting tables and tending bars in New York City, and now she is literally one of the most influential politicians in the United States. Things like this don't happen in real life, right?"" the company asked.

""But it is happening and we are all witnesses. What makes it even crazier is that she's just getting started. Like if this were a trilogy, we’re probably only about 45 minutes into part one -- aka the origin story -- so let's recap.""

The promotional video also praises AOC for supporting a climate protest outside of then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's office in November of 2018. Since becoming House speaker, Pelosi, D-Calif., has clashed with the congresswoman -- suggesting her social media following was relatively insignificant when compared with the amount of power she and other progressives had in Congress.

But FCTRY touted her Twitter following -- 5.5. million followers -- along with her status as the youngest congresswoman ever elected.

Guy Benson: We'll get to our guests in a moment. Coming up later in this hour Congressman Adam Kinzinger will join me as well. Guy Benson show dot.com is our Web site please subscribe to the podcast if you'd like. That's Guy Benson show dot.com. We begin this hour with Senator Rand Paul a Republican of Kentucky. He has a brand new book out the case against socialism. Senator good to have you back.

Sen. Rand Paul: Glad to be with you Guy.

Sen. Rand Paul: So before we get to the book and we'll definitely delve into that I just want to ask you about your reaction. There was a statement out from the White House today from the president announcing new sanctions against Turkey the redeployment of American troops in the region to monitor what's happening in Syria and to as the president says prevent a repeat of 2014 if ISIS were to reconstitute. Do you favor these sanctions do you favor having troops in the area to possibly intervene if necessary.

Sen. Rand Paul: You know I think our founding fathers were very prescient when they assigned the role of deciding when we go to war to Congress. And so it's sort of a separation of powers issue that has gotten lost over time. But our founding fathers were very clear. You know Madison said that the executive branch is most prone to war. Therefore we delegated that power. You know we vested that power in the branch the legislative branch because they were fearful of having a president that was too powerful and too much war. And so really if people want to be at war in Syria there needs to be a big debate in Congress and that's how you determine whether something's in in one's national interest. People throw that term around loosely and say well it's in our national interest to be in Syria. And like most Americans are scratching their heads saying really to be in the middle of a five sided complicated war where some of these people been fighting more than a hundred years some of these few have been fighting a thousand years where the way we determine whether we should be there is we have a big spirited debate in Congress and the legislature decides whether we should be at war. The problem with Syria is if we had that debate I don't think anybody up here knows who would be at war with or are going to be at war with Turkey our NATO ally Turkey is allied with a Free Syrian Army which was also our ally for seven years but they're now fighting with Turkey. You've got Assad on the other side and the Russians and the Iranians and you've got the Kurds somehow in the middle. And I think one of the ironic things that you've already seen within the first 48 hours here is the Kurds are now appealing to Assad for protection. And it really is probably the best chance of the Syrian Kurds to ever have any autonomy within Syria is probably having the protection of Syrians and having an intact border between Syria and Turkey. So I think we'll see what happens but I'm very hopeful actually that the new twists and turns will lead to a negotiated settlement. I think what's prevented a negotiated settlement previously has been that the neocons and the people who want to stay everywhere forever have insisted that Assad go that we have regime change in Syria and that insistence has meant that Syria and Assad can't be any part of a negotiated settlement. So you can't have a negotiated settlement if you don't have two parties to it.

Guy Benson: OK. And look I understand your point about the separation of powers in your view of presidential power and war powers what the Constitution says but sanctions for example against Turkey. That's something that is being openly discussed and will be debated in Congress. If there were a significant sanctions package against Turkey based on what they are doing on the ground in Syria is that something that you would be willing to support if it's debated and passed through Congress. You mentioned Turkey as a NATO ally. Do you consider them an ally at this point.

Sen. Rand Paul: I consider them sort of a frenemy. I don't think they've been a great ally and I'm not big on sort of this forever commitment to everybody that's in NATO. That's why I haven't wanted to keep adding people to NATO. So no I don't think they I don't think Turkey's been a good ally in recent times. I think their purchase of Russian missiles should exclude them from any of our weapons. And so there are different ways you can try to use our leverage over Turkey to try to get them to behave in a way that is consistent with them being an ally. But the first step I think would be without question withholding weapons and I've been for withholding weapons from Turkey simply because of their purchase of the Russian missiles. This is an additional reason why I withhold weapons. I separate withholding weapons from sanctions for a couple of reasons. I think sanctions work a little more indiscriminately on the on the population of Turkey and often can turn the population of a country against America whereas withholding holding arms then really hurt anybody in Turkey. It just prevents Turkey from doing things ultimately with those arms that we disapprove of. I would have done the same with Saudi Arabia. I greatly object to the crown prince and I would have withheld arms until we got better behavior out of Saudi Arabia. But I wouldn't vote or wouldn't actually really not prefer any way. Sanctions against Saudi Arabia because I think really trade and continuing of trade unless you're at war with somebody is probably the better part of valor.

Guy Benson: Last question on this subject. And it goes to I think one of the arguments that non interventionists make and the president has made this argument as well and I think it appeals to a lot of voters which is we shouldn't be embroiled in these complicated conflicts where our interests are muddy at best. And I understand boots on the ground by the many thousands in a place like Syria is going to have a lot of detractors here in America I'm skeptical of it myself. But when you look at the Kurds these are the type of people that a lot of non interventionists say that's that's what we need people in that region taking care of their own dirty work in this case fighting and taking many casualties against ISIS with our support if we support people and they they die by the thousands fighting ISIS which I think is definitely in the U.S. broader interest isn't it. Isn't it a problem if we then abandon those people forcing them into the arms of Assad and Russia.

Sen. Rand Paul: Well see I'm not so necessarily sure that it's going to be a bad thing that they will be with Assad. I think it's actually their best time and the chance for actually having a homeland unless the U.S. is going to send 10 20 30 40 50 thousand troops over there to create a homeland form and guard them against everybody from around there. So no I don't think it is in their best interests but my obligations to the Constitution and I think it's complicated in the sense that people think go Kurds or Kurds well they're Turkish Kurds who are Iraqi Kurds and are Syrian Kurds. They don't necessarily all like each other. They have different political parties. The Syrian Kurds primary political arm is socialist and has been terrorist within Turkey and they do want part of Turkey they want part of Turkey to be split off into a Greater Kurdistan and Turkey objects to that. They've been fighting over this issue for 50 60 70 maybe even 100 years. So I think we have to look at it that way and decide. But also I think we have to ask what is the best chance for the Kurds. People have written these ridiculous things saying oh the Kurds have been fighting our war for us what a bunch of hogwash. The Kurds have been fighting for their villages and for their towns and for their women and for their families. And we help them but that doesn't mean that we said oh yeah we've been helping you fight against these terrible people ISIS What Should Be thank you not oh we're now so mad that you're not going to stay forever and create a country for us. President Trump said that he would help the Kurds with ISIS to defeat ISIS. We did. And so really the answer should be not oh yo you ungrateful people you won't help us forever it should be thank you so much for helping us kill these awful people we now control these villages but we're in the middle of a country that we're going to have to deal with. And I don't think the Kurds are physically able nor are we ever going to carve out a region of Syria and say This is yours. But there is a semi-autonomous area within Iraq that is working that should be the model. I think if they work with the host government which is Assad for better or worse the war is over people then go. What are we going to do keep battling on. And what would we have done if Lindsey Graham and Hillary Clinton had gotten their way and the Sunni extremists had won in Syria would we be better off. No I think they would have been a calamity for al-Qaeda and al Nusra to win the war. Assad is a bad guy but I think Al Nusra was worse.

Guy Benson: Yeah I mean and that's certainly debatable. I mean one of my biggest concerns is about ISIS. Some of these guys high value guys escaping and reconstituting and at some point posing enough of the threat where America feels like Okay now we have to go back in. But Senator we'll put a pin in that discussion because it's ongoing I want to talk about your book The Case against socialism it's brand new. You had a bit of let's say an eventful appearance on The View this week. I'll play briefly cut 24. This was an argument that Ana Navarro made about socialism and Venezuela. Listen. Well if you vote for a socialist you might get socialism.

Video Clip: Come on. Don't do that.

Guy Benson: And then she says Maduro is not a socialist. He's a corrupt murderous thug who is starving his people. Just if you would Senator. This came as news to me that Maduro isn't a socialist of course he's a socialist and when socialism often is fully implemented you get messy bloody ugliness throughout history all over the world. But what about maybe a kernel of truth in her argument which is there are forms of maybe social democracy that I oppose but are not the type of corrupt violent socialism that we see in a place like Venezuela that some of the American socialists would aspire towards as opposed to the disaster in Caracas.

Sen. Rand Paul: Well we certainly get to that. But her first point is about Venezuela. She's saying Maduro is a thug and a murderer but not a socialist and my response had she let me speak was that. Can't you be both. Can't you be both a socialist and a thug and it's even more than that. One of the themes of our book The Case against socialism is that perhaps it's not just an accident that you get violence and accident that you get thuggery. Maybe it's an inevitability that if you try to completely socialize things if you tried to appropriate the property or the farms and the businesses that ultimately you can't really do that with a kinder gentler dictator. It takes a ruthlessness if you really want to have full and complete socialism. It does take that ruthlessness. You're right. They look at Scandinavia and they say oh well what about democratic socialism in Scandinavia. Well they've got it all wrong. Scandinavia is not socialist in fact the prime minister of Denmark said to Bernie Sanders Pipe down you know we're not socialist you're you're bad for business we don't want the world to think we are socialist. And when you look closely at Scandinavia which my wife and I did in this book what you actually find is they are a welfare state with a lot of so-called free stuff sort of the freebies of socialism. But the interesting thing is what what Bernie Sanders says is a big lie. He says the rich will pay for all of these things if we bring it to America in Scandinavia. The working class pay a 25 percent sales tax and the middle class pays 60 percent income tax. So the dirty little truth about sort of big welfare states.

Guy Benson: Say that again is the middle class pays 60 60 percent income tax.

Sen. Rand Paul: 60 percent income tax starting at around sixty thousand in Scandinavia. So you have these enormous taxes on the middle class and a 25 percent tax on everyone. But that's you know when you talk about a burden as far as your income the poor and the working class paying a 25 percent sales tax is a big burden for the poor. So you can have the so-called welfare state of Scandinavia. It's not socialism but you can have that big welfare state but you cannot have it by just taxing the rich. That is the big lie Bernie and AOC is they say oh we're going to tax the rich. There's only a few of them anyway. They don't have any votes. You know nobody will care. And this is a demagoguery that we have to expose because in reality Scandinavian welfare ism is supported by massive taxes on the working class and the middle class.

Guy Benson: And would that be your criticism of Elizabeth Warren as well because she's trying to distance herself from Bernie saying I'm not a socialist. Into my bones on the capitalists but a lot of her policies look awfully similar to Bernie's.

Sen. Rand Paul: Well she's more Medicare for All which basically would cost 60 trillion dollars. Where's the money going to come from. Some reporters have begun asking her are you going to tax the middle class. Bernie at least admits that he's going have to tax somebody but you'll save a lot of money on the free insurance. Elizabeth Warren has been unwilling to answer the question but it is an important question where's the 60 trillion coming from with Bernie and I see the problem is they say they're going to tax people but what they propose for taxes is not nearly enough to pay for their you know their dreams of this paradise. They want to create.

Guy Benson: Less than a minute to go. Let me pick up on Medicare for All or single payer health care from your perspective as a medical doctor what's the moral case not just the what will it cost price tag issue what's the moral case in your eyes as a doctor against government run health care.

Sen. Rand Paul: Well leads to shortages it leads to terrible quality and leads to doctors you know selling meat out of the back of an ambulance. We tell that story in our book The Case against socialism. So it just doesn't work practically. But it's also this idea that Bernie seems to put out there that somehow he has a right to a doctor services or a nurse's services and that really is an immoral notion to believe that anyone has the right to someone else's labor.

Guy Benson: Senator Rand Paul a Republican from Kentucky. His new book just out the case against socialism Senator thank you. Thank you. We will step aside and be right back as the guy Benson show continues."

Bolton told aide to alert National Security Council lawyer after meeting with Ukrainians about investigations: impeachment testimony

Fiona Hill, the former senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs, told lawmakers investigating possible impeachment charges against President Trump on Monday that a July meeting with Ukrainian and U.S. officials about unspecified investigations left her and John Bolton, the former national security adviser, so concerned that he directed her to alert a lawyer in the National Security Council, Fox News confirmed. The meeting in question took place July 10, a little more than two weeks before President Trump's controversial call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. Both Bolton and Hill, who were present at the meeting, had concerns about the conversation, she testified.

Hill, who exited the administration days before the July 25 phone call, testified on Monday for about nine hours in front of three House panels. The Wall Street Journal reported that those at the hearing took her comments to refer to the ""investigation that could implicate Biden and his son."" Click here for more on our top story.

In addition, Hill had high praise for ousted U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch during testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. Yovanovitch, who herself testified before congressional lawmakers last Friday as part of the impeachment inquiry, was recalled from her ambassadorship in May by Trump, around the same time that Rudy Giuliani — Trump's personal attorney — pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate corruption allegations against Democrat Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who was involved with the board of a gas company there.

Democratic dozen at fourth presidential primary debate will be a record-breaker

A really big stage is set the fourth round of Democrats' presidential primary debate Tuesday night. Twelve candidates have qualified, meeting the polling and fundraising criteria. That means the showdown tonight will be the largest in presidential primary history, topping the 11 Republicans who faced off in a primary debate in September 2015, according to political research from Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a political newsletter and website.

The dozen Democratic White House contenders who made the cut are – in alphabetical order: former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; businessman and environmental advocate Tom Steyer; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

Twelve candidates on the same stage at the same time could make for an unwieldy debate and a lot of jockeying for time and attention. The debate will be held at Otterbein University, a liberal arts institution in Westerville, Ohio. The Democratic National Committee's media partners for the showdown are CNN and The New York Times. All eyes will be on Bernie Sanders, who just two weeks ago was rushed to the hospital when he suffered a heart attack.

Trump imposes sanctions on Turkey, threatens more severe penalties, to stop invasion into Syria

President Trump on Monday authorized sanctions and raised steel tariffs on Turkey and threatened more severe financial penalties if Ankara continued its military offensive in northern Syria launched the president decided to withdraw U.S. troops from the region more than a week ago. Trump also urged Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to negotiate a peaceful end to the violence is sending Vice President Mike Pence and White House National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien to lead a delegation to Turkey to seek a resolution to the conflict.

In addition, the president announced, U.S. troops in northeastern Syria will be withdrawn from the country as planned and redeployed “in the region to monitor the situation and prevent a repeat of 2014,” when the Islamic State made major territorial gains.

Trump mulls idea of lawsuit against CNN over recording of network 'bias'

President Trump on Monday floated a lawsuit threat against CNN over reports that the network’s president, Jeff Zucker, launched an internal bias campaign to undermine his presidency. In a tweet posted Monday evening, Trump said, “’Project Veritas-Obtained Undercover Videos Highlight Jeff Zucker’s (@CNN) Campaign To Destroy Trump. Videos Reveal @CNN’s BIAS!’ @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Does this sound like a good, or even great, lawsuit?”

The president’s latest gripe with CNN comes after conservative activist group Project Veritas published undercover recordings from an alleged “whistleblower” that capture CNN employees casually confirming the network's anti-Trump bias and show Zucker telling top news executives to focus solely on impeachment even at the expense of other important news.

LeBron James calls Rockets' GM Morey 'misinformed' over Hong Kong tweet

Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James said Monday that Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey was “misinformed” when he posted a tweet that kicked off a costly dispute between the NBA and its Chinese fans and sponsors. “I’m not here to judge how the league handled the situation. I just think that when you’re misinformed or you’re not educated about something – and I’m just talking about the tweet itself – you never know the ramifications that can happen,” James told reporters on Monday night back in Los Angeles.

On the roster: Biden son: Ukraine deals ‘poor judgement’ in ‘a swamp’ - Fight night in Ohio - Bolton called foul on Trump-Giuliani Ukraine moves - Giuliani got big bucks from indicted Ukrainian - For the long run



BIDEN SON: UKRAINE DEALS ‘POOR JUDGEMENT’ IN ‘A SWAMP’

ABC News: “As President Donald Trump continues to fill his Twitter feed and campaign speeches with attacks on Hunter Biden over his foreign business deals, the former vice president’s son defended the ethical implications of his private ventures in an interview with ABC News, but conceded taking a misstep in failing to foresee the political implications on his father’s career. ‘In retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part. Is that I think that it was poor judgment because I don't believe now, when I look back on it -- I know that there was -- did nothing wrong at all,’ said Biden. However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is...a swamp in—in—in many ways? Yeah.’”



Fight night in Ohio - Politico: “Bernie Sanders is recovering from his heart attack. Joe Biden is under siege, and laying into Donald Trump. And the entire Democratic presidential field has become consumed with the House’s impeachment inquiry into the Republican president. With so many candidates responding to circumstances beyond their control — and the threat of a destabilizing moment running high on a stage that’s expanding to 12 candidates from 10 — it’s raising the specter of a debate Tuesday that finally breaks the Democratic primary logjam. Not only is it the first debate since Sanders was hospitalized and the impeachment inquiry began, it also comes as many lower-polling candidates become increasingly desperate to make a mark on the campaign. At a fundraiser in Los Angeles last week, Biden acknowledged how much of the debate is out of any candidate's hands. … Biden said, ‘One of the problems I’m finding, I’ve got to be more aggressive.’”



Will Buttigieg throw elbows? - Politico: “Pete Buttigieg sees a path to the top tier of the Democratic primary field, elbowing his way between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren on one side and Joe Biden on the other. At the center of Buttigieg’s push is his health care plan, which the South Bend, Ind., mayor has dubbed ‘Medicare for all who want it.’ The plan would extend a public health insurance option to Americans without ending the private insurance market, an effect of the plan put forward by Sanders and endorsed by Warren. … Buttigieg also argued that his health care plan is tougher on insurance providers than Biden’s own public option proposal to build on Obamacare. ‘It turns out that setting up the exchanges has not been enough to empower all Americans to have good coverage,’ Buttigieg said.”



Beto says he need to ‘break through’ - Texas Tribune: “Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke raised $4.5 million in the third quarter, his campaign announced Friday as he acknowledged it was more urgent than ever to ‘break through’ in the still-crowded primary. The third-quarter total is an improvement over the $3.6 million that the former El Paso congressman took in during the previous quarter, and it came despite a halt to fundraising for roughly two weeks in August after the deadly El Paso shooting. Still, the total puts him behind a majority of primary rivals who have released their third-quarter figures so far, including two leading candidates who each raised around $25 million.”



Bloomberg back to floating trial balloons - CNBC: “Mike Bloomberg might end up running for president, after all. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, has indicated to associates in recent weeks that Joe Biden’s recent struggles against Sen. Elizabeth Warren are making him rethink his decision to stay out of the 2020 Democratic primary. That’s according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were deemed private. Bloomberg has signaled he’s ‘still looking at’ running for president, but people close him say that the only way he could even go down that path is if Biden’s fortunes suffer so much that he drops out before or during the early stages of the primary. Bloomberg could then enter the race as one of the rare moderates with enough name recognition and campaign funding to make a run.”



Dems on edge over cyberattacks - Politico: “The Democratic National Committee sent an urgent alert on Monday to every presidential campaign aimed at avoiding a repeat of the cybersecurity fiasco the party suffered at the hands of Russia and Wikileaks in 2016. The subject of the email was ‘Counter-Disinformation Update,’ and it was part of a regular series of communications by DNC Tech, the party’s in-house group responsible for internal security and monitoring the spread of fake news about Democrats. POLITICO obtained the full archive of DNC’s Tech’s missives to the presidential campaigns. They reveal a party struggling to combat the continued onslaught of the twin threats faced by the Democratic Party: cyber penetration from state actors abroad and the spread of disinformation about its top presidential candidates by Donald Trump and his allies at home. … It was a moment, the DNC warned, to be hyper vigilant about fake news.”



Seven years later, Warren changes tune on health care - Politico: “Seven years before Elizabeth Warren said ‘I’m with Bernie on Medicare for All,’ she was campaigning for the Senate and didn’t want to talk about single-payer health care. Running a tough race against Republican incumbent Scott Brown, the first-time candidate repeatedly distanced herself from the idea. … But during her first Senate campaign in 2012, she … dodged the question again and again, according to an analysis of newspaper reports, TV, and interviews with health care reform activists at the time. … Warren's refusal to embrace single-payer during that campaign came four years after she co-wrote an essay that called it the ‘most obvious’ solution to the nation's health care woes — though perhaps ‘politically unacceptable.’ Warren’s remarks in 2012, as well as her more circumspect attitude toward Medicare for All at the beginning of her presidential campaign, has exposed her to criticisms from the left.”



Warren strong in Q Poll, but still lags on electability - Quinnipiac University: “One day before the next Democratic debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden remain locked in a close race for the top spot in the Democratic primary, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. Warren receives 30 percent of the vote among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, while Biden gets 27 percent.. … However, on the question of electability - which candidate has the best chance of winning against Donald Trump - Biden retains his commanding lead with 48 percent saying he has the best chance, compared to 49 percent in August. While still trailing Biden, Warren has increased her support from 9 percent in August to 21 percent today. No other candidate gets into double digits.”

TIME OUT: TO THE HOLY LAND

Smithsonian: “On April 1483, a German politician named Bernhard von Breydenbach embarked on a religious pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Breydenbach and his companions—among others, Dutch artist Erhard Reuwich—traveled at a leisurely clip, touring destinations including Venice, Corfu, Modon and Rhodes while en route. Two years after his pilgrimage, Breydenbach created an illustrated guide detailing the farflung locales he had visited on his trip. The text, titled Peregrinatio in Terram Sanctam, or A Pilgrimage to the Holy Land, was an instant sensation, with eleven editions in six languages published between 1486 and 1505. Now, one of the few surviving first editions of Breydenbach’s ‘15th-century bestseller’ is set to go on view at the British Museum… Giulia Bartrum, curator of German prints at the British Museum, [says] that prior to the text’s publication, ‘most of the depictions of places such as Jerusalem or Venice were totally made up.’”

BOLTON CALLED FOUL ON TRUMP-GIULIANI UKRAINE MOVES

Fox News: “Fiona Hill, the former senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs, told lawmakers on Monday that a July meeting with Ukrainian and U.S. officials about unspecified investigations left her and John Bolton, the former national security adviser, so concerned that he directed her to alert a lawyer in the National Security Council, Fox News confirmed.

The Wall Street Journal reported that those at the hearing took her comments to refer to the ‘investigation that could implicate Biden and his son.’”



Giuliani got big bucks from indicted Ukrainian - Reuters: “President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was paid $500,000 for work he did for a company co-founded by the Ukrainian-American businessman arrested last week on campaign finance charges, Giuliani told Reuters on Monday. The businessman, Lev Parnas, is a close associate of Giuliani and was involved in his effort to investigate Trump’s political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, who is a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic Party nomination. Giuliani said Parnas’ company, Boca Raton-based Fraud Guarantee, whose website says it aims to help clients ‘reduce and mitigate fraud’, engaged Giuliani Partners, a management and security consulting firm, around August 2018. Giuliani said he was hired to consult on Fraud Guarantee’s technologies and provide legal advice on regulatory issues.”



Feds dig deeper - WSJ: “Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are examining Rudy Giuliani’s business dealings in Ukraine, including his finances, meetings and work for a city mayor there, according to people familiar with the matter. Investigators also have examined Giuliani’s bank records, according to the people. Witnesses have been questioned about Giuliani since at least August by investigators, who also want to know more about Giuliani’s role in an alleged conspiracy involving two of his business associates, the people said. The investigation is being led by the U.S. attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York. Giuliani has denied wrongdoing and on Monday said he hadn’t been informed of any investigation. ‘They can look at my Ukraine business all they want,’ he said.”



Dems return from recess more united on impeachment - WaPo: “…Just days after suddenly embracing an impeachment inquiry of President Trump — a moment of seeming political crisis — House leaders sent lawmakers home for their scheduled two-week recess. But as Congress returns to work Tuesday, fears of lost momentum, internal dissension and dissipating interest in impeachment have mostly evaporated among House Democrats, who view the past two weeks as among the most damaging to Trump as they dig in for their constitutional showdown with the president. … But on the central question of whether Trump ought to be investigated for potentially committing high crimes and misdemeanors worthy of removal from office, Democrats are now largely united: Only seven of 235 House Democrats have stopped short of endorsing the impeachment inquiry, and the White House position, laid out in a letter sent to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and three committee chairmen last week, has hardened the resolve of many Democrats.”

Barely registering the polls and with less than $700,000 of campaign cash on hand, the former San Antonio, Texas mayor who later served as Housing and Urban Development secretary under President Barack Obama is facing the possibility that his appearance at the debate at Otterbein University in suburban Columbus, Ohio may well be the last time he makes the stage.

BUTTIGIEG AND O'ROURKE CLASH OVER GUNS DURING DEBATE

Castro grabbed only 8.2 minutes of speaking time at the debate – the third least amount among the record-setting 12 candidates on the stage – and didn’t score a breakout moment.

But in an interview with Fox News in the spin room following the debate, Castro vowed that he’ll fight on even if fails to make November’s cut and optimistically said he’ll qualify for the next debate.

“I’m going to keep fighting on. I believe that with hard work, we can make the next debate in Atlanta. We have about three and a half weeks to do that. So I’m going to keep working hard to get there,” he said.

Castro’s comments stand in contrast to his dire warning to supporters in a fundraising email late last week.

""I don’t say this lightly: If I don’t make the next debate stage, it will be the end of my campaign,"" Castro emphasized.

FOX NEWS' BRETT BAIER ON DEBATE WINNERS AND LOSERS

To date, eight candidates say they’ve qualified: They are – in alphabetical order – are former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, businessman and progressive and environmental advocate Tom Steyer, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

After the debate, it was hard to find a political pundit who praised Castro’s performance.

But asked by Fox News if his debate performance helped him in his goal to make the next debate stage, the candidate said, “I think so. It’s always a scramble for time with 12 people up there but I made the best use of the time that I did get. I was very sharp on issues that people care about and I think that will make a difference.”

And he touted on Twitter that “donations are coming in from all around the country.”

Castro also took aim at the media hosts for the debate - CNN and the New York Times – telling reporters in the spin room and highlighting on Twitter that there were “three hours and no questions tonight about climate, housing, or immigration. Climate change is an existential threat. America has a housing crisis. Children are still in cages at our border.”"

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., announced that she would no longer be accepting campaign donations of more than $200 from big businesses and challenged her fellow White House hopefuls to be more transparent about how they’re funding their own campaigns.

Warren blasted some of her Democratic primary rivals in a post on Medium, in which she accused them of “hobnobbing with the rich and powerful” and “handing out secret titles and honors to rich donors.”

“I’m proud to be running a grassroots-funded campaign for president, and I hope my fellow candidates for the Democratic nomination will do the same,” Warren wrote. “That’s why I’m also calling on every candidate in this race to disclose any donor or fundraiser who has a special title on their campaign…and to disclose the dates and locations of their fundraising events and the names of every person who appears on a host committee on invitations tied to those events.”

THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL IN THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

Warren added: “If Democratic candidates for president want to spend their time hobnobbing with the rich and powerful, it is currently legal for them to do so – but they shouldn’t be handing out secret titles and honors to rich donors. Voters have a right to know who is buying access and recognition — and how much it costs.”

In her post, Warren does not specifically call out any of her fellow candidates, but her words appear to be a rebuke of Democratic presidential primary hopefuls like former Vice President Joe Bide, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif, and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Each of these candidates have raised millions of dollars through fundraisers and private events with wealthy donors — a practice that is common in both major political parties in the U.S.

Warren, along with fellow candidate and Vermont lawmaker Bernie Sanders, have spurned big-dollar donors this campaign season, in favor of relying on small-dollar, online donations. The results have surprisingly seen them outraising other candidates last quarter.

Warren’s critics have slammed her for holding fundraisers in the past and using some of the money left in her war chest to launch her 2020 presidential bid. But since announcing her candidacy, Warren has not taken any PAC or big-dollar donations.

“I’m not going to take any contributions over $200 from executives at big tech companies, big banks, private equity firms, or hedge funds,” Warren wrote. “And when I’m the Democratic nominee for president, I’m not going to change a thing in how I run my campaign: No PACs. No federal lobbyists. No special access or call time with rich donors or big dollar fundraisers to underwrite my campaign.”

Despite outraising most other candidates last quarter, Warren’s rivals still say that the small-dollar donations will hinder her chances of defeating President Trump should she win the Democratic nomination.

“We're not going to beat him with pocket change,"" Buttigieg said in a Snapchat post, adding that Democrats ""need the full spectrum of support in order to compete.”"

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at the fourth round Democratic presidential nomination debate, but the former vice president has a potentially larger headache – a lack of campaign cash.

As Biden was on the debate stage Tuesday night, his third quarter of fundraising filing to the Federal Election Commission was making headlines.

BIDEN'S THIRD QUARTER FUNDRAISING HAUL A WARNING SIGN

According to the report, Biden had just under $9 million in his campaign coffers after spending more money than he raised during the July-September fundraising quarter. That’s far less than Warren, who reported $25.7 million cash on hand, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, another top tier rival who reported having $33.7 million in the bank.

Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield, pressed on the report, told reporters in the spin room after the debate in suburban Columbus, Ohio that “it’s more important how you spend the money than how you raise it.""

And she emphasized that “we have resources that we need to continue to run our race. We’ve always said we think this race is going to be a dogfight, that it’s going to go long. We’re building an operation that is going to be sustained.”

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

On Wednesday, Biden said he was confident he had the fundraising to make it to the general election.

“Our fundraising is building. We've raised a lot of money online. And we've raised money offline as well, so we feel confident we're going to be ready,” he told reporters at a campaign event in Ohio.

And taking aim at Warren – who transferred more than $10 million from her 2018 Senate re-election campaign to her White House bid – Biden noted he “did not start off by dropping $10 million from a Senate campaign, wherever that money was raised from, into a race.”

It was just two weeks ago that Biden was left in the dust by Warren, Sanders, and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg when it came to their third-quarter fundraising hauls. And unlike Warren and Sanders – who’ve brought in most of their money from small-dollar grassroots donations -- much of Biden’s money comes from top-dollar fundraising events with big-bucks donors.

A Democratic consultant who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely called the $15.2 million Biden raised in the third quarter “a devastating number.”

Taking an indirect shot at Biden, Warren campaign chief strategist Joe Rospars highlighted the new data released Tuesday.

“The FEC report data are pretty stark. There’s nowhere to hide from the reality of the dollars and the calendar in front of us,” Rospars tweeted on Wednesday. “Is a campaign’s fundraising growing? Is its spending able to grow going into the early contests, as it must? For Warren, the answers are yes and yes.”

Democratic operative Michael Ceraso described the new Biden cash on hand figure as troubling.

Ceraso, who worked on Sanders’ 2016 campaign and who parted ways this summer with the Buttigieg campaign, warned that Biden needs to remain in the top tier conversation or “his cash flow may dry up as the primary enters the homestretch, which may prevent the VP from competing and challenging his opponents in Super Tuesday states and beyond.”

Biden is spending money at a greater rate than the amount he raised left him, with a burn rate of 112 percent. Warren’s burn rate - the pace at which candidates are spending their campaign cash – was a much more modest 76 percent.

Republicans spotlighted Biden’s campaign cash on hand figures as a warning sign for a candidate who has already relinquished his status as the unrivaled front-runner in the polls.

“Biden’s money problems are now a crisis for the campaign and if he doesn’t turn it around soon, he’ll end up on the sidelines sooner than anyone anticipated,” emphasized Joe Gierut, press secretary for the pro-Republican America Rising PAC.

Fundraising is far from definitive, but like polling, it’s an important barometer of a candidate’s momentum and his or her campaign’s strength. Among the things funds can be used for are building staff and grassroots outreach efforts in the crucial early voting states and running TV, radio, and digital ads.

Biden ‘eclipsed’ on 2020 debate stage

The spotlight on the former vice president’s campaign cash numbers came as the spotlight at the debate shifted from him to Warren, who has soared in recent months and is now tied in most national and early voting state polling with Biden for the top spot in the nomination race.

Biden was front-and-center as the debate kicked off, focusing on the Ukrainian controversy and the impeachment inquiry.

But when the conversation turned to the battle over ""Medicare-for-all,"" the former vice president was mostly absent from the discussion as the spotlight shifted to Warren.

The populist senator, who has produced one progressive policy proposal after another, grabbed the most speaking time in the debate, roughly six more minutes than Biden, who was second.

“He faded at times,” noted Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of the Georgetown University’s Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor. ""He popped his head up occasionally.

“He did allow himself to get eclipsed by some others, like Buttigieg and (Sen. Amy) Klobuchar and some of the others,” added Elleithee, a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign who later steered communications for the Democratic National Committee. “He’s got to step up. He cannot miss opportunities and I think he missed a few.”

GOP strategist and presidential campaign veteran Colin Reed called Biden “nearly invisible” at the debate and said it’s “a sign of how far this campaign has fallen that no one bothers to go after him.”

But Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a top Biden friend and 2020 surrogate, told reporters in the spin room on Tuesday night that being out of the spotlight benefitted Biden.

“Unlike previous debates where the vast majority of the attention was focused on testing or challenging Vice President Biden, tonight was a night when Sen. Warren’s plans on a wide range of issues – from the wealth tax to 'Medicare-for-all' – came under repeated questioning,” Coons highlighted.

Biden echoed that sentiment on Wednesday, saying ""it's kind of about time other people get questioned.""

And he pushed back on the labeling of Warren as a co-front-runner, saying “I haven’t seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a frontrunner.”

Once again, the debate stage showcased a lackluster group of extremist politicians pandering to their far-left base of support with harmful policy proposals that are way outside the mainstream.

The three septuagenarian candidates currently making up the top tier of the Democratic field include a confused and corrupt former Vice President Joe Biden some 20 years past his prime; unelectable socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who recently suffered a heart attack; and hopelessly out-of-touch former Harvard professor and current Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who wants to throw 180 million Americans off their private health insurance plans, including union workers.

Stuck with a field marred with enormous electability questions, no one is paying closer attention to the weakest field of presidential candidates in recent memory than 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

WARREN COMES UNDER ATTACK FROM ALL SIDES AT DEM DEBATE, AS BIDEN DEFENDS SON'S BUSINESS PRACTICES

These two nationally recognized liberals are likely thinking the same thing as everyone else: none of the 12 mediocre candidates on the stage in Ohio Tuesday night has what it takes to defeat President Trump in November 2020.

After watching the three-hour snooze fest, here are some of the takeaways that Clinton and Bloomberg may be thinking about as they consider jumping into the presidential race.

The Democratic candidates are desperately lurching farther and farther to the left. This strategy of embracing extremism is clearly designed to capture the hearts and minds of the Democratic primary electorate by repackaging the tired Big Government policies of the past. Capitalism and liberty have become dirty words with this crowd. Look no further than new reports Tuesday night that Green New Deal author and socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York – along with radical Reps. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota – plan to endorse Sanders for president. Throughout history, socialism has failed at every turn and will fail once again as the Democrat’s party platform in the 2020 general election.

Joe Biden’s son Hunter and his shady foreign business dealings were glossed over and badly mischaracterized. This should have been the big issue of the night. Serious allegations against the Bidens are being whitewashed by a biased mainstream media that has gone headfirst into the dishonesty tank during the Trump administration.

The impeachment witch hunt led the discussion because the Democratic Party has no positive agenda. All the candidates reminded viewers about the partisan nature of the baseless impeachment inquiry against President Trump by rushing to judgment before getting the facts. It’s become clear that impeachment is being pushed because desperate Democrats can’t defeat Trump at the ballot box in less than 13 months.

Democrats are offering the American people big tax increases, job-killing over-regulation, and lawless open borders. These failed and harmful ideas aren’t polling well with voters. But the far-left Democrats are so committed to Big Government that they ignore the fact that their plans would wreck the vibrant Trump economy and punish American families and businesses.

“Medicare-for-all,” championed by Sanders, is so extreme that even some of the Democratic presidential candidates oppose it. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., pointed out that the disastrous proposal would result in a “multitrillion-dollar hole” in the federal budget. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota called the irresponsible plan a “pipedream.” They’re both right.

The debate will not change the trajectory of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Nothing happened to suggest someone had a breakout moment and will show real upward movement in the polls. The top tier will remain Warren, Biden and Sanders.

Despite the best efforts of Democrats, President Trump’s amazing accomplishments to improve the lives of the American people simply cannot be explained away. The national unemployment rate of 3.5 percent is at a 50-year low and the unemployment rates for women, African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans are at historic lows. Over 6 million jobs have been created on President Trump’s watch – including 500,000 manufacturing jobs – and a record number of Americans are currently employed. To paraphrase former President Bill Clinton, elections are about the strong economy – and continued prosperity.

In a debate that featured barely a spark – much less fireworks – there’s ample reason for Democratic power brokers around the country to be concerned about where the current overcrowded field is headed. So they might be looking for other options before the Iowa caucuses kick off voting for the presidential candidates in February.

Here’s the reality:

Job creators, entrepreneurs and investors alike know that President Trump at his core thinks like a pro-growth businessman, and that gives them confidence to make decisions that expand their businesses.

On trade, President Trump’s vision and leadership have changed opinions on how we approach China, Mexico, Canada, and the European Union. The president knows there is a difference between free trade and fair trade when it comes to prioritizing American workers.

In Tuesday night’s debate in the critical Rust Belt state of Ohio – as the Democrats highlighted their failed vision of tax increases, overregulation, and giving away the store to China – the contrast with the positive Trump record couldn’t be starker.

Well-known liberal egotists Clinton and Bloomberg certainly think a lot of themselves and despite their baggage could probably fare better against President Trump than the current slate of boring Democrat wannabes.

And if the Democrats really want to recreate the 2008 Obama coalition, there’s another candidate who could immediately become the party’s frontrunner due to nostalgia alone. Her name is Michelle Obama. But the problem with nostalgia is that we tend to remember what we liked and forget what we didn’t like.

The clear reality emerging at the end of the long debate was that these are desperate times for a Democratic Party suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome.

Who, in the name of helping President Trump, would promote a video that depicts him as a maniacal murderer?

Politics is a rough game and I don’t shock easily, but this is so beyond the pale that it’s hard to grasp.

Now it’s important to say at the top that there’s no evidence the president knew about this. White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham tweeted that her boss hadn’t seen it, but “based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns” it.

Campaign officials also say they hadn’t seen it. So did Donald Trump Jr. and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, both of whom spoke at the conference, at Trump National Doral Miami, where it was played.

And the organizer for the conference, the pro-Trump group American Priority, denounced the video.

But a participant at the Miami conclave was concerned enough to use an intermediary to slip the footage to the New York Times.

Just to be clear, this is not one of the satiric videos that the president has retweeted, like the WWE-style one showing a Trump character body-slamming a guy with a CNN head.

WHITE HOUSE CONDEMNS FAKE VIDEO SHOWING TRUMP SHOOTING JOURNALISTS

“The most violent clip,” says the Times, “shows Mr. Trump’s head superimposed on the body of a man opening fire inside the ‘Church of Fake News’ on parishioners who have the faces of his critics or the logos of media organizations superimposed on their bodies.”

Here’s what happens:

“Many parishioners’ faces have been replaced with the logos of news media organizations, including PBS, NPR, Politico, The Washington Post and NBC.

Mr. Trump stops in the middle of the church, pulls a gun out of his suit jacket pocket and begins a graphic rampage. As the parishioners try to flee, the president fires at them. He shoots Black Lives Matter in the head, and also shoots Vice News.

“From there, Mr. Trump attacks a range of his critics. He strikes the late Arizona senator John McCain in the back of the neck. He hits the television personality Rosie O’Donnell in the face and then stabs her in the head. He strikes Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California. He lights the head of Senator Bernie Sanders, a Democratic presidential rival, on fire.

“He takes Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, hostage before throwing him to the ground. Then he strikes former President Barack Obama in the back and throws him against a wall. The clip ends with Mr. Trump putting a stake into the head of a person with a CNN logo for a face.”

Hilarious, no?

A CNN statement said, “Sadly, this is not the first time that supporters of the president have promoted violence against the media in a video…but it is by far and away the worst.”

The piece says parts of the video were posted on YouTube last year by a user with a record of creating pro-Trump mashups.

Put the targets aside for one minute. In this era of mass shootings, why would even the most rabid partisan want to promote video of a massacre? We’ve already endured actual massacres in a church, in South Carolina, and a synagogue, in Pittsburgh.

And we’ve already seen violent nutjobs target political and media figures, from the man who opened fire at a Republican baseball practice to the pipe bomber who mailed explosives to prominent Democrats and CNN.

I’ve been just as vociferous about a play, a video and other imagery (such as Kathy Griffin holding up a severed head) that portrays Trump as being killed. Griffin is murdered in the pro-Trump video and has denounced it.

The video seems indiscriminate in depicting other Trump targets, including not just Obama but Bill and Hillary Clinton, CBS, HuffPost, Mika Brzezinski, Adam Schiff and…Harvey Weinstein?

The conference organizer said the macabre video, apparently adapted from a dark comedic film from 2014, was shown as part of a “meme exhibit.”

Who on the planet thought this was a good idea to bring to a gathering with various Trump World luminaries?

Did those involved expect a standing ovation? Raucous laughter? An invitation to the White House?

We need to know more about who created this travesty, and people of every political stripe should condemn it."

WELCOME TO THE THUNDERDOME, ELIZABETH WARREN

WaPo: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose steady stream of plans have propelled her to the top of the Democratic presidential field, came under sustained attack for the first time during a raucous primary debate here Tuesday that revealed Democrats’ ongoing public struggle to define their beliefs and choose a standard-bearer to take on President Trump. Warren (Mass.) faced direct challenges from several of the 11 other candidates onstage, who took her on over her policies, her fitness to serve as commander in chief and her willingness to question the motives of Democrats who support less transformational ideas. … The focus on Warren deflected attention from others facing scrutiny entering Tuesday’s debate, which was hosted by CNN and the New York Times. Former vice president Joe Biden went for long stretches without surfacing… Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), meanwhile, showed no signs of lingering health trouble.”



Klobuchar, Buttigieg shone through - National Review: “The October Democratic presidential-primary debate finally brought a genuine surprise, in that a pair of second-tier candidates who were in danger of being forgotten woke up, smelled the coffee, and brought their A-games: Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg. Considering how other second-tier candidates have turned in good performances in past months and seen little movement in the polls, this may not be a turning point in the race for either candidate. But in a way-too-long, often-boring debate that was stuck in the middle of an otherwise jam-packed news environment, Klobuchar and Buttigieg managed to stand out.”



Sanders and Warren have deep pockets as Biden burns cash - AP: “Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren don’t just lead the Democratic presidential primary in fundraising. They’ve stockpiled millions more than their rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden, who burned through money at a fast clip over the past three months while posting an anemic fundraising haul. Sanders held $33.7 million cash on hand on his third-quarter fundraising report. Warren had $25.7 million during the same period, while South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg came next $23.3 million. Biden, meanwhile, held just $8.9 million, a small fraction of what his leading rivals have at their disposal. With the first votes of the Democratic contest just months away, the candidates are entering a critical and expensive period when having an ample supply of cash can make or break a campaign. Biden’s total raises questions about his durability as a front-runner.”



Squad to endorse Sanders - Fox News: “Three members of the so-called ‘Squad’ of far-left freshman members of Congress are lining up behind Sen. Bernie Sanders for president. Fox News has learned that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., will appear with Sanders on Saturday in Queens, N.Y., at a ‘Bernie’s Back’ rally designed to generate excitement for the senator’s campaign following his recent heart procedure. Rep. Ihan Omar, D-Minn., will also endorse the candidate, Fox News confirmed. In addition, CNN reported that Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., will endorse Sanders as well. It was not immediately clear if Omar and Tlaib will appear at Saturday's event. … The endorsements would be a significant blow to the campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren…”



Steyer spending stupendous - WSJ: “Billionaire Tom Steyer appeared on the Democratic presidential debate stage for the first time Tuesday night, but voters in early states have already seen him on TV thousands of times. Mr. Steyer, who new federal filings show has poured nearly $48 million of his own money into his long-shot bid, is dominating television screens in the first four states that will hold nominating contests early next year. Since entering the race in July, Mr. Steyer has spent more than $26 million on TV ads, airing more than 53,000 spots in markets that reach Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada voters, data from ad-tracking firm Kantar/CMAG shows. All told, that is more than six times as many as the rest of the Democratic field combined.”



THE RULEBOOK: DEMOCRACY AND CHILL

“Where the whole power of the government is in the hands of the people, there is the less pretense for the use of violent remedies in partial or occasional distempers of the State.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 21



TIME OUT: AN INVENTOR’S SLAP SHOT

Smithsonian: “Invented by Frank Zamboni, the eponymous ice-clearing machine celebrates its 70th anniversary this year. He applied for his first U.S. patent in 1949, for this innovative idea that totally transformed winter sports by giving chopped-up ice surfaces a fresh-frozen smoothness in a matter of minutes. ‘At the time, he was just trying to address a need of his,’ says Frank Zamboni, the inventor’s grandson and now president of the Zamboni Company. ‘He saw a need for the ice rink he owned with his brother and cousins… Instead of taking 1 1/2 hours to clean the ice, that was time somebody could be paying to skate on it.’ Contrary to popular belief, the Zamboni machine was not invented in Canada—the place of snow and ice—but in Southern California—the land of sun and fun. … As time went on, he saw a need to quickly clean the ice, so he started improvising with war-surplus equipment.”

PELOSI STILL NOT BITING ON IMPEACHMENT VOTE

Politico: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leaders will hold off on a full House vote authorizing an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, according to multiple lawmakers and aides. Democratic leadership sources caution, however, that the decision could be ‘reassessed at some point.’ The move came amid opposition from key chairmen and members of leadership, as well as a number of centrist Democrats facing tough reelection bids. Trump, White House officials and Republicans on Capitol Hill have seized on the absence of such a vote as an unacceptable break with House precedent and have vowed to resist what they describe as an illegitimate probe. But Democrats defended their current impeachment process, which has multiple House committees interviewing witnesses in private and gathering evidence related to allegations that Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, pressured Ukrainian officials to begin an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son — potentially at the risk of losing U.S. military aid.”



Gallup: Majority now supports removing Trump from office - Gallup: “Public opinion on whether Trump should be impeached remains mixed, but Americans now lean slightly more in favor of impeachment and removal from office compared with where they stood in June. Currently, 52% say Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 46% say he should not be. This is roughly the opposite of what Gallup found in June when asked in the context of special counselor Robert Mueller's investigation.”



Staffers fear White House seeking scapegoat on Ukraine call - NYT: “President Trump has for weeks sought to unmask the whistle-blower who shed light on his Ukraine dealings. But instead aides have fixated on one another: Advisers began a fact-finding review that some fear is a hunt for a scapegoat, according to White House aides and other people familiar with it. Even as the impeachment inquiry intensifies in Congress, White House lawyers are leading their own review, the people said. They are seeking to understand White House officials’ actions around Mr. Trump’s July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, which is central to the whistle-blower’s allegation that Mr. Trump abused his power. The lawyers’ inquiry centers on why one of their colleagues, the deputy White House counsel John A. Eisenberg, placed a rough transcript of the call in a computer system typically reserved for the country’s most closely guarded secrets. Mr. Trump later directed that a reconstructed transcript be released amid intensifying scrutiny from House Democrats.”



Mulvaney emerges as key figure in impeachment probe - WaPo: “In late May, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney organized a meeting that stripped control of the country’s relationship with Ukraine from those who had the most expertise at the National Security Council and the State Department. Instead, Mulvaney put an unlikely trio in charge of managing the U.S.-Ukraine account amid worrisome signs of a new priority, congressional officials said Tuesday: pressuring the fledgling government in Kiev to deliver material that would be politically valuable to President Trump. The work of those ‘three amigos,’ as they came to call themselves — diplomats Gordon Sondland and Kurt Volker, plus Energy Secretary Rick Perry — has come to light in recent days through newly disclosed text messages and the testimony of government witnesses appearing before an impeachment inquiry in Congress.”



BEVIN RECOVERS IN KENTUCKY POLL

WYMT: “The Mason-Dixon Kentucky Poll was released early Wednesday morning, and the results are interesting. The poll shows that statewide, 46 percent of likely voters support Republican Governor Matt Bevin, while 46 percent back Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear. At the beginning of the year, Beshear held a 48 percent-40 percent lead over Bevin, but the incumbent has pulled into a tie with his challenger. One percent of respondents voted for Libertarian nominee John Hicks, while seven percent were undecided. The poll also shows Bevin's GOP support grew from 67 percent in December to 77 percent. He is pulling in 22 percent of Democrat respondents for the cross-over vote, while Beshear is drawing 15 percent from Republicans. Among the Mason-Dixon poll participants, Bevin led among men, older voters and rural voters. … The poll credits some of Bevin's resurgence to President Donald Trump's popularity in Kentucky and resistance to his impeachment.”



Second debate was heavy with personal attacks - Louisville Courier Journal: “Republican incumbent Matt Bevin and Democratic challenger Andy Beshear had their ugliest public exchange Tuesday at the second gubernatorial debate of the fall campaign. Throughout the discussion, hosted before a raucous crowd of supporters on the University of Kentucky campus, the two rivals called each other liars and regularly interrupted one another as they were peppered with policy questions. When moderators asked about ways they would encourage students to pursue a career in public education, including the state's colleges and universities, the conversation took a turn into the gutter. … The high stakes debate touched on health care, pension reform, medical marijuana and supporting out-of-work coal miners. But it underscored how Kentucky's race for governor this year is defined by Bevin and Beshear's enmity as much as their deep differences on tackling the state's woes.”

AUDIBLE: THANKS?

“[Amy Klobuchar] had some smart answers. I’m starting not to care that she is brutal to her staff.” – Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, writing in Politico about the Democrats’ debate.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“If Trump is impeached and the Senate is mad at him, votes him out, then the GOP could have a primary too. That would take up a lot of news from the Democrats. I think we need a law for 6 months of elections, period.” – Karen Morrow, Tampa, Fla.



[Ed. note: It would be a comfort to have such constraints, it’s true. But our Constitution just wouldn’t allow for it. The government can’t tell people when they can talk about issues, therefore there’s no way to keep candidates from campaigning and reporters from reporting. I’m increasingly in favor, though, of doing away with primary elections. Our 40-year experiment with them has been a miserable bust and has unnecessarily prolonged our election calendars.

“I have pretty much come to the opinion that two things will happen…one, the 2020 election is not going to be over on election night (owing to huge court battles to follow many very close races) and…two, at some point our Agitator-in-Chief is going to leave office of his own volition…having become tired of the battle and wanting to go back to his business dealings and such. What say youse (that’s a Michigan (born & raised there) UP term)?” – Rick Randell, Bradenton, Fla.



[Ed. note: I say that I know better not to say, Mr. Randell! I think there are lots of potential scenarios for 2020 that could still be in the offing. We may yet see a landslide or even, dare I say, a political realignment. As for Trump leaving early, it’s pretty hard for me to fathom. I doubt he’d give his enemies the pleasure.]

SLÁINTE, MR. BRADLEY

HuffPo: “A man in Dublin, Ireland, decided to inject a little humor into his funeral Saturday by playing a prank on his loved ones. Shay Bradley, a Defense Forces veteran who died Oct. 8 ‘after a long illness bravely borne’ according to his obituary, shocked then delighted funeralgoers when they suddenly heard his voice shouting from his coffin as it was being lowered into the ground. ‘Hello? Hello. Hello? Let me out!’ stunned attendees heard in a prerecorded message that also included ‘knocking’ against the coffin’s lid. … Those at the funeral can be seen giggling and wiping away tears as Bradley’s voice begins to sing: ‘Hello again, hello. Hello, I just called to say goodbye.’ His daughter Andrea Bradley told HuffPost that her father recorded the audio about a year ago — and that no one really knew about it other than her brother Jonathan and her nephew, Ben. Two days before Shay Bradley’s funeral, Jonathan Bradley decided to tell his mom and the rest of his siblings about the prank. He told them that playing the audio at the funeral was his dad’s dying wish.”

“My non-baseball friends are forever puzzled by my devotion to the game. I agree entirely with them about the irrationality of fandom. … It’s ridiculous.

Hunter Biden's business activities in Ukraine and China are the conversation Trump wants the public to have to distract from bigger political issues, Sanders told Martha MacCallum Tuesday on ""The Story.""

""This was absolutely Hunter's decision to do the interview,"" she said.

""Frankly, for three weeks, Hunter Biden has been the focus of attacks, lies -- and, frankly, smears -- unsubstantiated smears by the administration, Donald Trump himself and the Trump campaign.""

HUNTER BIDEN BREAKS SILENCE ON UKRAINE BUSINESS DEALINGS, CLAIMS HE DID 'NOTHING WRONG AT ALL'

Just before the interview on ""The Story,"" host Martha MacCallum noted former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell -- a longtime ally of the Delaware senator -- said in retrospect Hunter should not have done the interview.

""I wouldn't have put Hunter on the air,"" Rendell told The Daily Beast.

MacCallum said the former Philadelphia mayor was also not alone as a Democrat in his reaction.

In response, Sanders reiterated throughout the interview that the campaign does not ""book the press"" for other members of the Biden family and that the 49-year-old acted on his own.

""This was completely his decision,"" she continued. ""Hunter spoke with conviction today. He was strong and forceful.""

In addition, she compared what she considered the younger Biden's straightforwardness with that of Trump and his circle.

""He answered every single question thrown at him,"" she said of Hunter. ""That is more than what we can say for Donald Trump and also Rudy Giuliani.""

Sanders continued, telling MacCallum it is Trump that brought Hunter Biden into the 2020 conversation.

""The only reason we're having this conversation is because Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani injected these lies and smears into the atmosphere and you know why they did it -- because Donald Trump is terrified of facing Vice President Biden in a general election.""

She pledged that if Biden wins in 2020, neither Hunter nor any other Biden family member will have offices in the West Wing, be sitting in on presidential-level meetings or the like -- pointing to members of Trump's family who are often seen in public with the president.

""I do believe I saw some criticism online about this from Donald Trump Jr. of all people,"" she said, claiming the first son is not someone, ""we should all look to as an example.""

She added that, in Tuesday's debate, she hoped Biden's fellow contenders will not make the conversation about things Trump wants Democrats to focus on.

""We hope that Democrats won't take the bait,"" she said."

""The big loser... was Joe Biden,"" she said. ""It was incredibly telling that all of the fire that was taken on stage was by Elizabeth Warren, and not Joe Biden -- indicating that even Democrats on that stage know that Biden is finished and that Warren is the new frontrunner.""

Sanders claimed Warren's ascension is a net positive for Trump and said her new position as frontrunner will rebrand her as the face of the party, to the detriment of other Democrats.

""She is the new face of the Democrat party,"" Sanders said. ""That is a great contrast for this president. And I think it sets him up very nicely for re-election in November.""

I couldn't believe that they glossed over the corruption that we've seen exposed over the last several weeks, so quickly as they did last night.

“The refs need to be investigated. This is horrendous. Check bank accounts. #NoExcuses,” he wrote.

Howard also lamented that Aaron Rodgers leading the Packers to a comeback win over Lions was going to be overshadowed by the officials – who took a major beating from players and social media.

“It is a damn shame that the brilliance of @AaronRodgers12 will take a backseat to TWO ridiculous calls by the officials. He made TWO of the best throws you will see all season.”

DETROIT LIONS PLAYERS, HALL OF FAMER CRITICIZE OFFICIATING AFTER CLOSE LOSS TO GREEN BAY PACKERS

Howard, who won Super Bowl XXXI’s MVP award as a member of the Packers, was not the only person to scrutinize the referees during the game. Hall of Fame running back Barry Sanders also voiced his opinion on the matter.

“That is sickening... the @NFL needs to look at a way to prevent that from happening. Two phantom hands to the face calls really hurts us tonight. Yes, we could have scored TDs, but @Lions played too well to have the game end this way,” Sanders wrote in a tweet.

The issues stemmed from an unnecessary roughness penalty on Lions defensive back Tracy Walker and an illegal contact penalty on defensive end Trey Flowers.

While referee Clint Blakeman defended Walker’s penalty, NFL executive Troy Vincent said Tuesday the Flowers penalty should not have been called.

It is being replaced by a new Democratic-Socialist Party.,2019-10-16,Fox News,Newt Gingrich: RIP Democratic Party – You’re being transformed into an anti-American engine of radical change,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/newt-gingrich-rip-democratic-party-youre-being-transformed-into-an-anti-american-engine-of-radical-change,"Tuesday night’s Democratic presidential candidate debate was one more reminder that we are living through the death of the Democratic Party. It is being replaced by a new Democratic-Socialist Party.

If you think I exaggerate, consider these examples.

Imagine what would have happened if any candidate in the debate had the courage (or lack of sense) to actively defend President Bill Clinton’s policies on welfare reform, capital gains tax cuts and balanced federal budgets, or his 1996 State of the Union assertion that “the era of Big Government is over.”

RONNA MCDANIEL: FOURTH DEMOCRATIC DEBATE WAS ANOTHER WIN FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND GOP

Imagine that any candidate had agreed with President Barack Obama’s original 2008 position that “I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.”

Or imagine that a candidate had defended ObamaCare as the solution to health care in America.

When the last two Democratic presidents can no longer be defended by the men and women hoping to become the next Democratic president, something profound has happened.

We have already seen the old Democratic Party (and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Rep. James Clyburn of South Caroline literally represent the old Democratic Party) being eclipsed by “the Squad.”

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York is now the spiritual leader of House Democrats. And every major Democratic presidential candidate has endorsed radical Green New Deal-type proposals that would expand government, destroy the energy industry, radically change America, and plunge the economy into a depression.

The Democratic-Socialist Party wants to outlaw private health insurance, punish the successful (especially the wealthy), and expand government control over virtually everything.

In 2020, every Democratic candidate will be faced with the challenge of defending a national party that is now the Democratic-Socialist Party.

The Democratic-Socialist candidates embrace policies ranging from wanting to confiscate guns; forcing the radical California gender curriculum on every state; removing the tax exemption for every church, synagogue, and mosque that defines marriage as between a man and a woman; providing free (meaning taxpayer-funded) health care to people living in our country illegally; and opening the border so anyone and everyone will be able to enter the United States without having to worry about immigration laws.

Some of these radical candidates favor tax-paid sex-change operations in prison – and genderless prisons (one of Biden’s contributions to the dialogue) so male criminals could declare themselves female to be sent to women’s prisons.

Imagine that one of the candidates had said he or she was against abortion. The result might have been a riot – and at a minimum an expulsion of the heretic. Instead, the new Democratic-Socialist Party stands for abortion on the last day of pregnancy, and its most radical acolytes are now for infanticide after delivery as long as “the infant would be kept comfortable” (see the New York state law endorsed by the Democratic governor of Virginia).

Almost equally heretical would have been a candidate defending Columbus Day (favored by 57 percent to 29 percent of the public, with the Democratic-Socialists once again in a position favored by about a quarter of the country).

Imagine that candidate attacking the National Education Association’s pledge that “educators must acknowledge the existence of White supremacy culture as a primary root cause of institutional racism, structural racism, and White privilege. ...the Association will actively advocate for social and educational strategies fostering the eradication of institutional racism and White privilege perpetuated by White supremacy culture.”

White supremacy culture is left-wing code for American history, American exceptionalism, the rule of law, the Constitution, and the various habits and patterns that made America the most prosperous and powerful nation in history.

Can you imagine one of the candidates in the debate arguing that our schools should not be centers of anti-American indoctrination dictated by left-wing unions? Of course not. They would be booed off the stage.

As The Wall Street Journal put it in an editorial headlined “Warren and Sanders, Policy Mates.” the pattern is overwhelming:

The editorial says this about Warren and Sanders: “They both would force these companies to get a new federal charter requiring them to consider ‘stakeholders’ rather than shareholders in their business decisions. They both want to reimpose the old Glass-Steagall fence between commercial banking and investment banking. 'The business model of Wall Street is fraud,’ Mr. Sanders likes to say. Ms. Warren also thinks bankers are crooks: 'Wall Street is looting the economy.’ They agree the U.S. Postal Service should become a bank that offers government checking accounts and would compete with private banks.

“On college as an entitlement, the two again see eye to eye. 'It’s time to cancel student debt and make universal free college a reality,’ one says. The other reverses the order: 'We are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free, and cancel all student debt.’ For the record, Ms. Warren’s plan is the first one.”

There are a scattered handful of traditional liberal Democrats in the House and Senate, but none have any chance of ever being a national candidate in the emerging Democratic-Socialist Party.

We are watching a historic moment in which a once-great American political party is transformed into an anti-American engine of radical change. In 2020, every Democratic candidate will be faced with the challenge of defending a national party that is now the Democratic-Socialist Party.

It will be a wrenching, defining moment for the party of Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy if it is conquered by the party of AOC, Sanders and Warren.

Lions defensive back Tracy Walker was flagged for unnecessary roughness on a play in which he collided with Packers wide receiver Geronimo Allison. Walker said after the game he was just trying to go for the ball and described the call as “awful” – a word he would use multiple times to describe the officiating.

“Awful. It was an awful call,” he said, according to ESPN. “I felt like I went for the ball and [it] just so happened we collided, but I was looking for the ball. It was an awful call by them. It is what it is, though.”

Referee Clete Blakeman explained in the pool report that regardless of intent Walker’s helmet-to-helmet contact will always draw a penalty.

Walker, a second-year safety, expressed his frustrations to reporters with the referees after the Lions’ 23-22 loss to the Packers.

“Extremely pissed off right now,” Walker said. ""It is what it is. Disappointed. Hurt. We had that game. I'm going to say the same s—t. We should have won it. It is what it is, though. Got to bounce back.""

He added that even though there were some “awful calls,” he knows the team had to play through it.

Walker was asked if he cared whether he gets fined for his comments, he said he didn’t.

“Detroit vs. Everybody,” Walker said, according to the Detroit Free Press. “I’m saying it. Detroit vs. Everybody. It’s awful.”

Detroit defensive end Trey Flowers also had trouble with the officiating as he was flagged twice for illegal use of hands. According to ESPN, he explained exactly what he was doing.

“I actually changed the position of my hand, because it was to the chest initially,” Flowers said. “Which is right here. I was doing it all game. I didn't know that was a flag to the chest, so I could change it to [motioning somewhere else on his chest]. They called it again.”

Walker and Flowers’ frustrations were echoed by Hall of Fame running back Barry Sanders.

“That is sickening... the @NFL needs to look at a way to prevent that from happening. Two phantom hands to the face calls really hurts us tonight. Yes, we could have scored TDs, but @Lions played too well to have the game end this way,” Sanders wrote in a tweet.

Detroit was called for eight penalties for 50 yards. The Packers were also flagged six times for 48 yards.

“We all know we can’t have those penalties, whatever it was that caused those to take place,” Lions coach Matt Patricia said, according to the Detroit Free Press. “We’ll go back and take a look at it and make sure we’re coaching it better, make sure we’re doing the right things. Just can’t have them. We know how dangerous Aaron Rodgers is and how detrimental those penalties are.”"

Moody's report, tweeted out on Tuesday, said early signs point to a Trump victory mostly fueled by a strong economy. However, the results will depend on voter turnout.

""Our 2020 Presidential Election Models: Early signs point to Trump, though turnout is key,"" the tweet read.

The report states that Trump has the advantage in several forecast models such as the economy, personal finances, and energy prices.

""The current environment of stable to low gas prices favors Trump in his reelection bid. Moreover, the baseline forecast calls for gasoline prices to dip slightly in the year leading up to the 2020 election,"" the report reads.

THERE'S 'MATERIAL CHANCE' TRUMP WILL BE REMOVED FROM OFFICE, SAYS MSNBC GUEST

""Finances matter here as well, as voters who feel better off from real and not just nominal, wage gains are more likely to express comfort in the status quo. This measure also favors Trump.""

The report also claims Trump would win in a massive landslide if voter sentiment about their pocketbooks was the main factor that drove them to the polls.

""If voters were to vote primarily on the basis of their pocketbooks, the president would steamroll the competition, taking home 351 electoral votes to the Democrats’ 187, assuming average voter turnout,"" the document states. ""This shows the importance that prevailing economic sentiment at the household level could hold in the next election.""

Moody's said Trump's fluctuating approval ratings will not work against him and are comparable to past presidents who have won reelection. They also say a strong stock market will help the president, even if it is not directly tied to economic growth.

SARAH SANDERS: DEMS ON DEBATE STAGE KNEW WARREN IS FRONTRUNNER AND BIDEN IS 'FINISHED'

The caveat comes in the form of voter turnout. The report claims that if turnout among Democrats and independents match their maximum historical highs, Trump would lose in a tight race.

""An average of the three sets of model results suggests that if turnout of nonincumbent voters in 2020 matches the historical high across states, then Democrats would win a squeaker with 279 electoral votes to the president’s 259,"" the report reads.

""Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Minnesota and New Hampshire would all flip from Trump’s column versus our average turnout baseline.""

Moody's stated that the country's continued economic upswing is vital to a Trump victory, but also claimed America is at risk of heading into a financial downturn, as part of an impending global recession, in the next 12-18 months.

“I think risks are awfully high that if something doesn’t stick to script then we do have a recession,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics. “I’ll say this also: Even if we don’t have a recession over the next 12-18 months, I think it’s pretty clear that we’re going to have a much weaker economy.”

Moody's said they have corrected their turnout models from 2016, which caused the forecast to incorrectly predict a victory by Hillary Clinton."

""This is a newly prosperous Middle America and it is Middle America that decides elections."" — Stuart Varney, Fox Business host

""This is a newly prosperous Middle America and it is Middle America that decides elections,"" said Varney on his Fox Nation show ""My Take.""

According to a study by Sentier Research, the country's middle class has seen a $5,000 annual increase in income under the Trump administration, totaling the median household income to approximately $66,000.

""Trump up $5,000 in three years; Bush, Obama up $1,500 in 16 years,"" observed Varney.

Varney believes the latest report will not play well for 2020 progressive candidates, who are ""unable to acknowledge Trump's success.""

""The socialists running for the presidency repeat their tired old cliches about 'the rich getting richer and you gotta work two or three jobs to make ends meet'...they can't say that tax cuts, deregulations, and cheap energy haven't brought prosperity... they can't say it,"" said Varney.

VARNEY: SANDERS' HOSPITALIZATION MAY TIP NOMINATION TO WARREN

""To acknowledge that means to acknowledge the success of Trump's policies and that's something no Democrat can do,"" Varney continued.

""It's the Democrats' dilemma,"" he added. ""How do you run against prosperity?""

Varney questioned whether the Democrats' ""current tactics"" are enough to ""beat the extra money in America's pocket.""

""You call the president names, you try to impeach him, you stomp your feet and you say, 'Oh, I just can't stand him,'"" said Varney, ""but does all of that beat extra money in Middle America's pocket? And will Middle America take a leap in the dark for socialism?"" he asked.

""It's hard to imagine that we will abandon the system that's made this country wealthy just because of the president's style and tone,"" Varney continued.

* Bernie Sanders hasn’t picked up many congressional endorsements for his presidential campaign, but he’s now picking up two fairly high-profile backers: first-year Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).

* Joe Biden’s campaign appears to have a rather serious financial problem: as the 2020 race enters the next stage, the former vice president only had about $9 million cash on hand as of two weeks ago. In contrast, Bernie Sanders had $33.7 million in the bank, Elizabeth Warren had $25.7 million, Pete Buttigieg had $23.3 million, and Kamala Harris had $10.5 million.

* With only three weeks remaining in Kentucky’s gubernatorial race, the latest Mason-Dixon poll shows incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin (R) tied with state Attorney General Andy Beshear (D), with each garnering 46% support.

* On a related note, Bevin’s fate is reportedly of keen interest to the White House, and Team Trump is reportedly “planning an 11th-hour push to stave off an embarrassing defeat” for the far-right governor.

* And speaking of the Bluegrass State, a judge yesterday sided with the Kentucky Democratic Party and ordered State Board of Elections to keep 175,000 purged voters on the state’s voter rolls.

* In Maine., the latest survey from Public Policy Polling found Sen. Susan Collins (R) trailing a generic Democrat in next year’s U.S. Senate race, 41% to 44%. The incumbent Republican hasn’t yet officially declared whether she’ll run for another term.

* In a newly released audio recording, Texas state House Speaker Dennis Bonnen (R) is heard telling a far-right activist that Donald Trump is “killing” the party “in the urban-suburban districts.”

* And though the president’s GOP primary rivals stand no realistic chance of success, it seemed notable that a Franklin Pierce University-Boston Herald poll found former Gov. Bill Weld with 14% support in New Hampshire, up from 3% in the same poll last month."

While there are some legitimate concerns that can be raised about Medicare-for-All on the merits—as opposed to on the politics—I am not convinced that it’s a problem that some people, like members of organized labor, have worked hard to negotiate good private health care plans. To me, this is a bit like arguing that we don’t need to eliminate Lyme disease because we can treat it with antibiotics. There is simply no value-added by having a profit or commercial basis to health insurance. If it is to exist at all, it should be strictly as a supplemental product.

But that’s an ideological opinion of mine and not a strategic analysis of what the Democrats should be pursuing on the health care front during the 2020 campaign. Watching the CNN debate on Tuesday night, I agreed with Warren and Sanders on the merits, but I thought the moderates had the better argument.

I have three concerns about pushing for Medicare-for-All right now. The first is that it’s obviously controversial and has big political vulnerabilities. Sanders freely admits that to pay for it will require taxes to go up on everybody who pays taxes, including the middle class. Warren is more reluctant to acknowledge this, although she doesn’t outright deny it. What they both argue, instead, is that overall costs will go down for the middle class because they will no longer have to pay premiums, co-pays, or out-of-pocket costs. This is most likely true in a general sense, although on an individual basis it might depend on how much health care someone uses in a given year. So, one problem lies in convincing people that a tax hike will benefit them, especially when it is not guaranteed that it will.

Another problem is the same one we see anytime health care reforms are proposed. People freak out about losing plans or access to doctors they like or having to wait in a queue to get treatment. This vulnerability isn’t avoidable or a good argument for not pursuing reforms but it does make it risky to propose something as disruptive as the abolishment of all private insurance. For me, this means that you should never propose something like this unless you’re serious about putting all your muscle behind it. And that gets to my third concern.

There is a basic cost-benefit error here. The chances of pushing a Medicare-for-All plan through the next Congress are almost nil. The Democrats would either have to overcome a Senate filibuster or they’d have to eliminate the legislative filibuster altogether. Let’s examine both of those scenarios.

The Democrats would need 60 votes to end a filibuster and they couldn’t get that many votes even if they won every competitive or semi-competitive Senate race next year. So, we can rule this out.

To end the legislative filibuster, they’d need 50 votes and the vice-president breaking a tie. But the Democrats will be lucky to have more than 51 or 52 seats even in a total landslide election. The problem here is that they’re unlikely to have enough unanimity in their caucus to end the legislative filibuster unless they can get closer to 55-57 seats. That’s both because senators are institutionally opposed to the change and because moderates get two valuable things out of the filibuster. First, it prevents radical legislation from passing which would endanger their political careers. Second, it puts them in the strongest negotiating position because they are the ones who can cut deals with Republicans (or so they like to think).

So, it’s not likely that the legislative filibuster will be eliminated by the next Congress. If it is, it will probably be after the first and most important year when even the moderates have to acknowledge that the rule is crippling their new president.

So, on a cost-benefit basis, there are easily identifiable downsides to proposing something that makes people apprehensive and that can be easily attacked and mischaracterized. What I can’t find is the upside. Where is the benefit in proposing something you won’t be able to enact?

And it’s not just the filibuster that makes it hard to enact. It’s also the lack of unanimity about it in the Democratic caucuses. I’m not at all certain that Nancy Pelosi could pass Medicare-for-All through the House. In the Senate, there could be a dozen or more Democratic senators who would never sign off on it. If the idea is to move the Overton Window to make Medicare-for-All more popular, that’s the job of a message candidate, not a candidate who plans on being the nominee.

This lack of unanimity was definitely on display during the debate last night when candidates like Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar all attacked Warren for proposing Medicare-for-All. That footage will be manna from heaven for Donald Trump or whoever runs in his stead next year. We can be angry about Democrats echoing Republican talking points, undermining support for Medicare-for-All, prattling about budget deficits, and giving ammunition to the GOP for the 2020 campaign. But we can also be angry that we have serious potential nominees who couldn’t predict these problems and avoid them.

What’s particularly annoying is that if Sanders or Warren were to become president, they’d probably struggle to pass the plans proposed by Biden and Buttigieg and be accused of Leninism for even trying. That’s the best they could hope to do, and they’d be exceeding my expectations if they succeeded. So, all this is is a big fat political weakness that has no discernible upside at all.

And I simply can’t understand why anyone would gift a person like Donald Trump something he can grab and beat them with. It’s dumb politics and for once the moderates have the better side of an argument."

One day after reports emerged that the group of far-left House Democrats planned to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders in the 2020 presidential race, it seemed only one of them – Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. – was officially aboard the Bernie Bus:

As for the others:

-- Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had made no official endorsement but was still rumored to be attending a Sanders rally scheduled for this weekend in Queens, N.Y. – one of two New York city boroughs that include a portion of Ocasio-Cortez’s home district.

BIDEN DISMISSIVE OF OCASIO-CORTEZ'S EXPECTED ENDORSEMENT OF BERNIE SANDERS

-- Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., clarified Wednesday that she had not yet endorsed a 2020 presidential candidate – even though CNN and Omar claimed Tlaib had backed Sanders.

-- Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., also hadn’t made an endorsement.

Pressley’s camp stressed that while the Squad members support one another in Congress, they don’t necessarily speak with one voice on all issues.

“Ayanna has tremendous respect for her sisters-in-service,” a Pressley spokesperson told Vox. “Ultimately, these political decisions are made as individuals.”

“Ayanna has tremendous respect for her sisters-in-service. Ultimately, these political decisions are made as individuals.” — Spokeswoman for U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.

One factor possibly stalling a Pressley endorsement of Sanders: She hails from the same state as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, so she might not be as eager to oppose a presidential candidate from her home area – the way that Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., for example, backed former Vice President Joe Biden instead of her fellow Californian, Sen. Kamala Harris.

According to Boston.com, Pressley’s ties to the Sanders campaign aren’t as strong as those of Ocasio-Cortez and Omar, with Pressley having backed Hillary Clinton over Sanders in 2016. In addition, Pressley has worked with Warren on legislation in Congress and also has close relationships with Harris and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who have been seeking her endorsement, the report said.

Tlaib, meanwhile, hasn’t ruled out a Sanders endorsement down the road, telling the Detroit Free Press she will host the U.S. senator from Vermont in her district later this month – just as she recently did recently with Warren. (Warren posted video from that visit online Wednesday -- and Tlaib retweeted it.)

""I am looking forward to bringing Senator Sanders to Michigan on Oct. 27 for a tour of our district that will highlight economic justice issues and corporate tax giveaways, and (include) a roundtable with housing justice advocates,” Tlaib said. “I need to know that anyone I choose to endorse will fight for my residents, and I appreciate the opportunity for them to have a dialogue with Sen. Sanders about these critically important issues.”

But regardless of what Tlaib and Pressley ultimately decide to do, the Sanders endorsement by Omar – and rumored endorsement by Ocasio-Cortez – were blows to the Warren campaign, coming on the same night that the senator fended off fierce attacks from fellow Democrats at the party’s presidential debate in Ohio.

As Boston.com noted, Warren has courted Ocasio-Cortez, having lunch with her in March, writing a blurb for Ocasio-Cortez’s entry in Time magazine’s “Time 100” listing, and filming a video with Ocasio-Cortez in which the pair reviewed the final episode of “Game of Thrones.”"

""Damn right we will,"" Sanders quickly responded. Sanders initially made a jobs guarantee when he released his version of the ""Green New Deal"" in August.

According to Sanders' plan, his sweeping overhaul to combat climate would require 20 million new jobs.

""These jobs will be good-paying, union jobs with strong benefits and safety standards in steel and auto manufacturing, construction, energy efficiency retrofitting, coding and server farms, and renewable power plants,"" Sanders' plan read.

Ocasio-Cortez and Omar have won immense praise from virtually every corner of the mainstream press and among the most extreme leftists in the Democratic Party. Both have been key players in promoting the “Green New Deal,” the most economically dangerous policy proposal offered in modern American history. (Sanders cosponsored Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal resolution in the Senate earlier in 2019.)

Among other things, Comrade Ocasio-Cortez’s GND would have the country abandon all fossil fuels over just a 10 year period, eliminate air travel, kill cows to halt climate change, provide “free” college, impose a single-payer health care system, and create a federal jobs guarantee.

OCASIO-CORTEZ, OMAR, TLAIB TO ENDORSE BERNIE SANDERS

Or, put more simply, the Green New Deal would transform America’s economy into a government-managed socialist nightmare. No wonder Ocasio-Cortez likes Bernie so much!

The timing for an endorsement couldn’t be better for Sanders, whose campaign took a big hit two weeks ago after the 78-year-old senator experienced a heart attack that forced him temporarily off the trail and gave a big boost to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Warren enjoys a strong lead over Sanders in most polls and is seen as the primary challenger to former Vice President Joe Biden, who remains the front-runner.

Ocasio-Cortez and Omar’s endorsement of Sanders will likely help Bernie win greater support among young socialists and progressives in the primary race.

One of Sanders’ biggest campaign weaknesses has been that although he has all the necessary socialist credentials to win a primary race in the modern Democratic Party, he remains an old, wealthy, white guy trying to win a nomination in a party currently obsessed with identity politics.

Ocasio-Cortez, a charismatic 30-year-old Latina, and Omar, 38, one of the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress, will help to improve his image among those who seem to believe age and race are among the most important qualifications for the nation’s highest office.

But whatever help Ocasio-Cortez and Omar’s support will offer Sanders in the upcoming primaries, it will most assuredly be heavily outweighed by the significant political damage these endorsements will have during the general election. Among many American voters, including middle-of-the-road Democrats, Ocasio-Cortez and Omar are about as politically toxic as it gets. In fact, “toxic” is probably a big understatement; they’re the Chernobyl of modern American politics.

A poll conducted by Axios of white, likely 2020 general election voters, with less than two years of college education—a demographic Democrats need to do better with in 2020 than they did in 2016 to have any chance of defeating Trump, found that although recognition of Ocasio-Cortez and Omar was high, support for both young socialists was extremely low. Only 22 percent of those surveyed said they had a favorable view of AOC, and only 9 percent said they had a positive view of Omar. Yes, you read that correctly—just 9 percent.

Further only 18 percent of those surveyed said they had a favorable view of socialism, while nearly seven in ten said they disapprove of socialism.

In July, Axios reported a “top Democrat … invoiced in 2020 congressional races” indicated that the internal polling data conducted of AOC was so bad that it “could put the [House] majority at risk.”

Other polling data show Ocasio-Cortez’s popularity in the toilet with other demographics as well. A March Quinnipiac survey revealed only 23 percent of Americans had a positive view of Ocasio-Cortez. Even in her home state of New York, AOC’s support is lackluster. A survey released in August found only 41 percent of New Yorkers like Ocasio-Cortez, roughly the same percentage of Americans across the country who said they have a favorable view of the freshman congresswoman.

The data couldn’t be clearer: Americans don’t support Ocasio-Cortez and Omar’s radical vision for America, so why would Bernie want to tie this gigantic anchor around his neck? Answer: He’s getting increasingly more desperate now that Warren’s campaign has started to surge.

Right from the start, it was apparent that for either Warren or Sanders to beat Biden, it would likely be necessary that one of the two would need to drop out of the race sooner rather than later.

Both Sanders and Warren come from the same region of the country and enjoy significant support within the most radical, socialist wings of the Democratic Party. Although the far left has unquestionably hijacked the DNC, it’s possible there still aren’t enough socialists in the party to push either Sanders or Warren in front of Biden while the vote is divided. From now until the primaries, the goal for Sanders and Warren will continue to be to try to build enough support to convince the other to drop out.

But all this political maneuvering will come at great cost. In order for Democrats to beat President Trump, they’ll need to do what Hillary Clinton couldn’t: win in much of the Midwest, in places like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Endorsements from AOC and Omar might make that incredibly difficult task even more insurmountable for Sanders, who already faced an uphill battle with voters because of the unpopularity of socialism in America’s Heartland.

With each passing day, it’s becoming more apparent that the leading Democratic Party candidates are digging the 2020 hole deeper and deeper, a clear sign that they are totally out of touch with the views of most American communities. How many times will they have to lose elections before they realize that people in the Heartland don’t share the same vision for the future as people like AOC and Ilhan Omar?

Based on the current campaign cycle, it appears the answer is at least one more presidential election.

The line of questioning started with Sanders, I-Vt., who just returned to the campaign trail after suffering a heart attack earlier this month. The 78-year-old was asked how he could “reassure” Americans that he was up for the task.

“We are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I’m going to reassure the American people,” Sanders said while thanking voters, friends and fellow Democratic primary candidates for their support. “I’m so happy to be back here with you this evening.”

Next came Biden—whose age has been a topic of conversation and criticism over the past several months on the campaign trail. CNN’s Erin Burnett quoted former President Jimmy Carter, who said that he wouldn’t have been able to start a presidential term at the age of 80, and pressed Biden why he thinks he could handle the pressure.

“Because I watched it, I know what the job is, I’ve been engaged,” Biden, 76, said, adding that “one of the reasons” he is running for president is his age—and with that, comes “wisdom.”

“We need someone in office this time around who on day one, on the world stage, can command respect from world leaders and know exactly what needs to be done to get this country back on track,” he said. “That’s one of the reasons why I decided to run this time because I know what has to be done. I’ve done it before, I’ve been there.”

He added: “I will not need any on the job training.”

Biden, who has grappled with sustained critical media coverage of a string of gaffes on the campaign trail, then vowed to release his health records, along with his tax records, before the Iowa Caucuses in January—the first contest of the 2020 primary season.

“I’m the only guy who’s released anything up here,” he scoffed.

Warren, D-Mass., who is 70, brushed off her age, when asked to respond.

“I say I will outwork, out-organize, and outlast anyone and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with,” she said.

Meanwhile, President Trump, who is 73, has said he feels “young” and is ready for another term of his administration.

“I feel like a young man. I am a young, vibrant man,” Trump said in April.

Should Trump be re-elected, he would be 74 on Jan. 20, 2021—Inauguration Day. Should the presidency go to one of the elder Democrats in the field—Biden would be 78; Sanders would be 79; and Warren would be 71.

But the CNN and New York Times moderators shifted to the other end of the spectrum, pointing to Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, for her young age of 38.

“It’s not fair to ask these three about their health and their wellness,” she said of the questions to Biden, Sanders and Warren. “Who is fit to serve as commander-in-chief?”

Gabbard said that she was, and further challenged the moderators to ask every candidate on the stage about their age and health—a suggestion that was ignored."

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on the presidential campaign trail, Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren said on Wednesday.

“I think AOC should be far less concerned with really campaigning for Bernie Sanders. She should be worried about her own back because I think she’s going to have a more difficult time with re-election than she thinks,” Lahren said on “Fox & Friends.”

Fox News has learned that Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., will appear with Sanders on Saturday in Queens, N.Y., at a “Bernie’s Back” rally following the senator's recent heart procedure. Rep. Ihan Omar, D-Minn., will also endorse the candidate, Fox News confirmed.

OCASIO-CORTEZ, OMAR, TLAIB TO ENDORSE BERNIE SANDERS

CNN reported that Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., will endorse Sanders as well. It was not immediately clear if Omar and Tlaib will appear at Saturday's event.

That makes three members of the so-called “Squad” of far-left freshman members of Congress who are lining up behind Sanders for president.

""The fact that we're in a place in this country that we take any of those three seriously, let alone elect them to office, is also appalling to me,"" Lahren added.

The endorsements would be a significant blow to the campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who, like Sanders, has been representing the party’s progressive wing.

Word of the endorsements also followed Tuesday night’s Democratic debate in Ohio, where Warren was under attack from multiple candidates after rising in the polls in recent weeks.

Winning the OK of the “Squad” members was also viewed as crucial in attracting young voters, as the top three Democrats in the polls are all senior citizens — Sanders is 78, former Vice President Joe Biden is 76 and Warren is 70.

There was no indication that the fourth member of the Squad, Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., was ready to make an endorsement — either of Sanders or any other candidate.

Lahren said the endorsements are not shocking or important to the race.

Lahren said she wasn't shocked by the endorsement from the ""Squad"" for the openly socialist candidate, as many of the far-left congresswomen have previously expressed support for his policies.

""The fact that we're in a place in this country where we take any of them seriously, let alone elect them to office, is appalling,"" she said.

Winning the OK of the “Squad” members was viewed as crucial in attracting young voters for the top three Democrats in the polls, all of whom are in their 70's — with Sanders at 78, former Vice President Joe Biden at 76 and Warren at 70 years old.

Reiterating her point, Lahren credited Sanders for ""calling himself a socialist,"" unlike Warren.

""The thing I'll give Bernie Sanders credit for is that he is one of the only ones...that actually calls himself a socialist...at least he's forthright about what he wants to do to this country,"" Lahren continued.

Later in the segment, Lahren highlighted her latest episode on Fox Nation's ""No Interruption,"" where she sat down with the real-life ""Wolf of Wall Street"" Jordan Belfort to hear his perspective on the 2020 candidates.

Belfort had strong words for Sanders and Warren, both of whom have called for a crackdown on Wall Street and financial institutions.

“Wall Street has a really, really important function, right? When Wall Street runs amok, it gets really ugly,"" said Belfort. ""What frightens me about a Bernie Sanders or an Elizabeth Warren is like they think that government is… the answer… but the policies that they're talking about will literally destroy the fabric of the country,” Belfort said in the latest Fox Nation episode.

Video journalist Nicholas Ballasy approached Guerra and asked for his opinion about American politicians like Sanders, who refused to label Venezuela a dictatorship.

""I suggest that Bernie Sanders take a week and go to Venezuela without bodyguards, and go onto the street and [use his] cell phone to [see] what's going on,"" Guerra said.

""They don't understand what is going on in Venezuela,"" he said earlier in the interview. ""This is a dictatorship... [There are] 400 political prisoners. They are persecuted, like me. And it's a new dictatorship, but it's a dictatorship.""

BERNIE SANDERS REFUSES TO CALL VENEZUELA'S MADURO 'DICTATOR,' SAYS 'DEMOCRATIC OPERATIONS TAKING PLACE'

In February, Sanders refused to label the country's socialist leader Nicolás Maduro a dictator and said Democratic operations still existed in the war-torn nation, despite crippling inflation and a starving populace.

“Why have you stopped short of calling Maduro of Venezuela a dictator?” CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked Sanders.

“I think it’s fair to say that the last election was undemocratic, but there are still democratic operations taking place in that country. The point is, what I’m calling for right now is internationally supervised fair elections,” he replied.

Bernie Sanders of Vermont took aim Thursday at presidential nomination rival Joe Biden, accusing the former vice president of using insurance industry “talking points” to criticize Sanders' plan to implement a government-run “Medicare-for-all” system.

“It is really sad that Joe Biden is using the talking points of the insurance industry to attack Medicare for All,” Sanders claimed in an email to supporters.

“Joe must know that we currently spend twice as much per capita on health care as the people of almost any other major country and that we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,” added the independent senator who’s making his second straight White House bid.

POLL: VOTERS OPPOSE 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' SYSTEM THAT ELIMINATES PRIVATE INSURANCE

Biden has opposed the “Medicare-for-all” plan championed by Sanders and supported by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts – a co-front-runner with Biden right now in the Democrats' primary race. The Senate bill – which Sanders authored – would eliminate private insurance. Biden, instead, has been pushing for a public option to strengthen and supplement the national health-care law better known as ObamaCare.

At Tuesday’s fourth-round presidential primary debate, Biden once again criticized “Medicare-for-all,” taking aim at its price tag.

“The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget,” he emphasized.

He also argued that the costs would be passed on to average Americans.

“If a fireman and a schoolteacher are making $100,000 a year, their taxes are going to go up about $10,000,” Biden noted. “That is more than they will possibly save on this health-care plan.”

BIDEN TAKES AIM AT SANDERS AND WARREN OVER 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

Responding, Sanders indirectly accused Biden of failing to stand up to the health-care industry.

“I will tell you what the issue is here. The issue is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the health-care industry, which made $100 billion in profit, whether we have the guts to stand up to the corrupt, price-fixing pharmaceutical industry, which is charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,” he stressed.

“If we don't have the guts to do that, if all we can do is take their money, we should be ashamed of ourselves,” Sanders added.

Speaking to reporters Wednesday in Ohio, Biden returned fire, saying, “Bernie doesn’t pay for half his plan.”

And, taking aim at both Sanders and Warren – who unlike Sanders has refused to acknowledge that middle-class taxes would rise to pay for “Medicare-for-all” – Biden said, “look, the last thing the Democrats should be doing is playing (President) Trump’s game and trying to con the American people to think this is easy. There’s nothing easy about it.”

The intra-party battle over implementing “Medicare-for-all” versus strengthening the nation’s health-care law – known as the Affordable Care Act – has been a leading and divisive issue in the race for the presidential nomination."

""I do believe that working people have not shared in the increased income in the United States over the last 40 years.""

However, he disagreed with Sanders' remarks about essentially banning billionaires in America. Steyer told Cavuto such an idea puts an ""arbitrary lid"" on Americans' dreams and desires

He said the federal tax code must be overhauled and voiced support for high taxes on the top one-tenth of one percent of earners.

""I would work like crazy to undo that,"" he said, however later clarifying again he believes he would not be a wealthy man if not for the American economic system.

""I don't believe that we should stop the free enterprise system,"" Steyer said. ""I'm somebody that understands the fact that if we're going to grow, we're going to have to rely on the innovation of the private sector -- but that we have to change some things.""

Later in the interview, Cavuto remarked Steyer is the only billionaire in the race, and that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg -- who initially ran as a Republican and later an Independent -- has considered joining the Democratic presidential field.

Cavuto said Bloomberg, who now identifies as a Democrat, may be wary former Vice President Joe Biden may not be able to hold the moderate-Democratic line if his campaign falters.

Steyer replied that he is unconcerned about a potential challenge from Bloomberg, 77, a media mogul by trade.

""Sanders calls himself a socialist and they -- the Squad and AOC --want primacy and power in the party,"" Schoen explained. ""If they went with Warren they'd be in also...she calls herself a capitalist, albeit, one with socialist principles. It's to maintain power and influence in the Democratic party that increasingly looks to AOC and the Squad for leadership.""

""I keep thinking it's really about a future presidential run for AOC,"" Ingraham added, explaining that Ocasio-Cortez can someday bring in Sanders supporters for her own run.

""The seeds of socialism have already been planted and, if we don’t rip [them] out at the roots, we and future generations are gonna wake up to a living nightmare."" — Tomi Lahren, Fox Nation host

""Bernie Sanders dispelled the notion that he and Elizabeth Warren are basically the same person -- even seemingly taking a bit of offense to being compared to Warren,"" Lahren said on Fox Nation's ""Final Thoughts.""

""Not because she lied about being a Native American, not because she may have lied about being fired for being pregnant, but because she is a capitalist,"" she continued.

TOMI LAHREN ISN'T SHOCKED BY 'SQUAD'S ENDORSEMENT

“There are differences between Elizabeth and myself,” Sanders said during an interview Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" “Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.”

Sanders explained he is not a capitalist because he ""will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary.”

Instead, Sanders is trying to run on a ""Democratic"" brand of socialism, which Lahren called ""a lie and an oxymoron.""

""You can’t have freedom -- economic or otherwise -- under socialism. He and others simply slap that 'democratic' before 'socialism' to make their warped desires of government-controlled everything seem more palatable,"" Lahren said. ""Sad thing is, it’s working -- especially on young Americans.""

SANDERS PROMISES NEW JOBS FOR 'TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS' DURING DEMOCRATIC DEBATE

The comments come amid a rise in socialism in the Democratic Party, as candidates become more willing to openly embrace socialism over capitalism. It also follows polling showing that Democrats now view socialism more positively than they do capitalism.

A Gallup poll this year found 43 percent of Americans think socialism would be a good thing for the United States, compared to a 1942 Roper/Fortune survey that found 40 percent of Americans described socialism as a bad thing.

""This just goes to show how dangerously close we are to becoming a socialist nation,"" said Lahren, commenting on the poll. ""The seeds of socialism have already been planted and, if we don’t rip those suckers out at the roots, we and future generations are gonna wake up to a living nightmare,"" she warned.

Lahren blamed the ""shocking and downright frightening"" shift on a misrepresentation of socialism and warned of potential ramifications.

""What is happening here?"" she asked. ""Well, leaders like Bernie... Warren, and others are not being honest about what socialism actually entails. They characterize it as a method of rooting out corruption, sticking it to the 'man,' and fighting for the little guy when, in fact, nothing could be further from the truth.""

""Socialism breeds corruption,"" she continued. ""There is no bigger 'man' than the 'Almighty Government' and the little guy is the one who is absolutely crushed by socialism.""

Doubling down in her criticism of the Vermont senator and his socialist policies, Lahren warned ""young people of the country"" not to fall for ""free things that will cost them their freedom.""

""I know free things might sound great to you now,"" she said, ""but here’s the cold, hard truth -- those free things come at a cost of your freedom. Don’t like being told what to do? Wait till you live under socialism. It won’t be pretty. You can be free or you can be dependent on the government -- but you can't be both. Choose wisely,"" she said.

""This next election and, even more importantly, the one after that, will determine the future of this nation,"" Lahren concluded. ""Don’t take it lightly.""

All of the 12 Democrats onstage in Westerville, Ohio, backed the ongoing impeachment inquiry against Trump. The debate marked the first time the candidates met since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's news conference last month at which she unilaterally declared the inquiry had begun -- a move that the White House has said is legally insufficient.

""Joe Biden continues to stumble and bumble through these debates. Bernie Sanders came in strong. Elizabeth Warren was treated as the frontrunner,"" McDaniel said.

""I don't think you're going to see any of this narrowing down to one candidate any time soon which is great for us. And, again, the president won because he was the main topic of discussion,"" McDaniel argued.

Warren, D-Mass., has repeatedly refused to say whether she will raise taxes on the middle class. During Tuesday's debate, she maintained that she would lower costs for everyone except the wealthy and large corporations. Sen.

PETE BUTTIGIEG RELEASES AD CRITICAL OF SANDERS' AND WARREN'S 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' HEALTH PLANS

Both Warren and Sanders have been at the forefront of pushing ""Medicare-for-all,"" a controversial and sweeping proposal that would effectively limit private health insurance. But Klobuchar suggested that Warren's plan was a ""pipe dream"" without naming specifics like tax increases.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg specifically called out Warren over this issue, arguing that she was taking away Americans' choice with her plan. Both he and Klobuchar instead pushed a public option.

Warren responded by arguing that Buttigieg's plan -- ""Medicare for all who want it"" -- would actually limit coverage to people who could afford it. She also shared several stories from the campaign trail of voters who went bankrupt because of medical costs.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was the big winner Tuesday night in Westerville, Ohio in the most crowded presidential debate ever held. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., also delivered strong performances.

Former Vice President Joe Biden and the other eight candidates on stage came out the losers in the three-hour Democratic presidential primary debate.

BIGGEST WINNER: Elizabeth Warren

Warren’s strong performance will likely solidify her frontrunner status ahead of Biden and Sanders. She emerged the clear winner of the night by showing she was sharp and prepared as she fended off attacks from candidates who were looking to cut into her polling lead.

WARREN COMES UNDER ATTACK FROM ALL SIDES AT DEM DEBATE, AS BIDEN DEFENDS SON'S BUSINESS PRACTICES

Even during the heated exchanges over health care and a wealth tax, Warren was able to turn attacks leveled against her around, and still deliver the best answers of the evening.

Warren questioned why the other candidates “think it is more important to protect billionaires than to invest in Americans” when responding to an attack on her plan for a wealth tax.

And importantly, Warren remained the focal point of the debate, speaking for the most amount of time of all of the candidates.

The senator from Massachusetts now has unmatched fundraising and polling momentum, along with a series of strong debate performances. This, coupled with the fact that Biden and Sanders have been weakened in dissimilar but debilitating ways recently, almost guarantees that Warren will take over as the front-runner.

SURPRISE WINNER: Bernie Sanders

Sanders has faced a precipitous decline in the most recent polls given the significant questions about his health and stamina following his recent heart attack.

However, Sanders delivered a strong, forceful performance in the debate, succeeding in showing voters that he has not lost a step, making him the second-place finisher of the night.

But it is clear that Warren has supplanted Sanders as the leader of the progressive movement in the Democratic field. As a result, it will be difficult – if not impossible – for Sanders to reestablish himself ahead of Warren.

It is clear that Warren has supplanted Sanders as the leader of the progressive movement in the Democratic field. As a result, it will be difficult – if not impossible – for Sanders to reestablish himself ahead of Warren.

SURPRISE WINNER: Pete Buttigieg

Buttigieg has been called the breakout star of the Democratic field – though he has recently struggled to distinguish himself. He had several strong moments in the Tuesday night debate. He was able to make a compelling case as a young, center-left candidate from a swing state with a military background.

Buttigieg was particularly strong during a tense exchange with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii over President Trump’s decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria, delivering a response that elicited cheers from the audience.

“Respectfully congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong,” the mayor said. “The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it's a consequence of a withdrawal and betrayal by this president of American allies and American values.”

Ultimately, Buttigieg’s performance will likely result in a post-debate polling bump with moderate voters, especially given Biden’s relatively weak debate performance.

LOSERS

BIGGEST LOSER: Joe Biden

All eyes, particularly those of Democratic leaders, strategists, and donors were on Biden, who needed deliver a strong performance to reassure voters that he is ready for a general election fight against Trump.

However, Biden was unable to break through and deliver the forceful showing that he needed, dodging a question regarding his son’s work with Ukraine and delivering several other uneven answers throughout the night.

With each passing day, Biden seems to move further from securing the Democratic presidential nomination, and his unimpressive performance Tuesday night will likely result in a post-debate polling decline.

LOSER: Amy Klobuchar

Additionally, although Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota had a number of well-executed lines taking aim at Warren, many felt similar to the inconsequential attacks leveled against Warren by former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland during the first debate. Thus, Klobuchar’s performance is unlikely to result in the post-debate polling spike her campaign needed.

LOSER: Kamala Harris

Sen. Kamala Harris of California similarly fell short, as she failed to distinguish herself in any meaningful way at a time when her campaign desperately needs a boost. Given that recent polls have her hoovering at around 5 percent, she will likely not be able to regain the momentum she had just over two months ago.

LOSERS: Gabbard, Castro, Steyer, Booker, O’Rourke and Yang

The remaining candidates – all barely registering in polls – were the biggest losers of the night. Rep. Gabbard, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, philanthropist Tom Steyer, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas and entrepreneur Andrew Yang failed to have the breakout moment they all desperately needed to show voters they could defeat Trump in November 2020.

Elizabeth Warren during the most recent Democratic presidential debate Tuesday for going too easy on big corporations.

The “Fahrenheit 9/11” filmmaker, 65, was tweeting during the event when something the 70-year-old presidential candidate said caught his attention. Warren explained that she has a plan to combat corporations only caring about their bottom line that she calls “accountable capitalism.”

In short, the plan calls on companies to be held accountable to their employees and their local communities rather than just shareholders. Moore, who has an estimated net worth of $50 million and who Business Insider previously reported has nine homes, is typically known for his left-leaning point of view. He took issue with Warren’s plan in that it doesn’t do enough to dismantle capitalism.

“Senator Warren (whom I love) just said she believes in ‘accountable capitalism,’” Moore tweeted Tuesday. “There is no such thing. The only thing capitalism is accountable to is weath [sic] and more wealth for the wealthy. It’s only mission is to economically enslave the citizenry so the rich can get richer.”

The “Bowling for Columbine” director also took jabs at former Vice President Joe Biden, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg for their respective stances on healthcare at the debate.

“Joe Biden, Amy K and Pete B just boosted the Republican chances of winning in November 2020 by their passionate defense of the for-profit, capitalist-greed health ‘care’ system,” he tweeted.

The only one that appeared safe from Moore’s taunts was Sen. Bernie Sanders.

For the better part of the year, former Vice President Joe Biden dominated the polls and the other candidates in the race attacked him from the left, which is weird to see.

Biden still believed in law enforcement and international borders, and he opposed forced bussing, along with virtually every other American. So he was obviously one of those right-wing extremists from the Obama administration.

That's what they were telling you on the debate stage. It was bizarre.

BIDEN RAMPS UP ATTACKS ON WARREN, DISMISSES HER AS A FELLOW FRONT-RUNNER

Thankfully, that line of attack is over because Joe Biden's presidential campaign itself is in effect over. Nobody thinks Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee. Elizabeth Warren is the front-runner now. That's not contested. The race is now hers to lose.

So during Tuesday night's debate, her rivals on the stage decide to help her do just that -- lose.

Pete Buttigieg, South Bend, Ind. mayor: Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything ... except this.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.: At least Bernie is being honest here in saying how he is going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

Joe Biden: I'm going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I'm the only one in this stage that has gotten anything really big done.

Klobuchar: And I appreciate Elizabeth's work. But again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done.

Biden: I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it.

Klobuchar: I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

Beto O'Rourke: Sometimes, I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

If Elizabeth Warren can't even explain her own signature plan to rearrange the entire American health care system, she can't win.

She is punitive? When Beto O'Rourke, Mr. Armed Federal Agents Coming to Your House, calls you out for divisive attacks, it's time to pay attention. And in fact, he does make a fair point.

The main reason Warren has surpassed Bernie Sanders in the hearts of primary voters despite pretty close economic programs is that she is the one far more willing to descend into the filth of identity politics.

Bernie is an ideologue. There are some things that he just won't say. Elizabeth Warren will say anything.

Recently, she tweeted this: ""Every person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. And that starts with using correct pronouns. I'm Elizabeth. My pronouns are she/her/hers.""

In case you were wondering -- in case there was any question at all -- that kind of posturing is central to Elizabeth Warren's campaign. She is happy to tell you, and often does, that you're worth less, or you're worth more, based on how you were born.

Unfortunately, that works right now in the Democratic Party.

One thing Elizabeth Warren is not willing to say, however, is how much her single-payer government health care plan will cost -- trillions of dollars, obviously. Nobody disputes that. Nobody disputes that.

And in fact, as a mathematical matter, there's no way to raise that kind of money without hiking taxes on the middle class. It's simple arithmetic. And yet for some reason, Warren refuses to admit that.

Marc Lacey, national editor for the New York Times: You have not specified how you're going to pay for the most expensive plan ""Medicare-for-All."" Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it? Yes or no?

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.: So I have made clear but my principles are here and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down.

Lacey: Mayor Buttigieg, you say Senator Warren has been ""evasive"" about how she is going to pay for ""Medicare-for-All."" What's your response?

Buttigieg: Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer.

Save that tape.

There are a lot of moments in debates that seem like a huge deal at the time. Everyone is yapping about them. But in the end, it turned out to be completely meaningless. This is not one of those moments.

Health care is always at the top of voters' concerns and so are taxes for that matter. If Elizabeth Warren can't even explain her own signature plan to rearrange the entire American health care system, she can't win.

Even a post-debate MSNBC panel acknowledged as much.

Claire McCaskill, former U.S. senator: I thought she seemed a little petulant at times when she was being challenged.

Eugene Robinson, Washington Post columnist: You think, a little?

McCaskill: A little.

Robinson: As Bernie Sanders says she just won't go there, and she was pummeled for it.

Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for MoveOn.org: They attacked her and she was uncomfortable. She did not handle it very well.

So was it really that bad for Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday night? We'll see.

She definitely got better treatment than Joe Biden got. Journalists don't like Joe Biden. Biden has zero allies in America's ""woke"" newsrooms. Warren, by contrast, has plenty of allies pretending to be journalists.

For example, on Wednesday morning, NYU ""journalism"" professor Jay Rosen -- the guy whose name often pops up, despite no talent whatsoever -- demanded that reporters stop asking specific questions about Warren's policies.

Again, a journalism professor telling you not to ask questions. Rosen tweeted: ""The 'make Elizabeth warren say she would raise taxes on the middle class' question should be a credibility killer. For the journalists who keep asking it.""

Now amazingly, Margaret Sullivan of the Washington Post agreed with that. She wrote this: ""Journalists are kindly doing President Trump's work for him when they insist on trying to pin down Senator Elizabeth Warren to declare she would raise taxes to fund Medicare-for-All. Of course, it's legitimate to dig into the costs, but not in a way that creates a nice GOP campaign ad.""

Did you listen to that? Two journalists telling you, if the answer hurts Democrats, don't ask the question. Don't tell your readers or viewers what the truth is if it increases the chances that Donald Trump could get reelected.

Is that journalism? No, it's pure propaganda. It is the definition of propaganda. Jay Rosen, journalism professor, telling journalists not to ask questions.

Unbelievable.

But, if Obama hypothetically jumped into the race, the poll suggested she would grab 26 percent support of likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State, with Warren and Biden at 20 percent and Sanders at 15 percent.

PETE BUTTIGIEG RELEASES AD CRITICAL OF SANDERS' AND WARREN'S 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' HEALTH PLANS

Rising in polls and facing increased scrutiny, Sen. Elizabeth Warren came under attack from two of her Democratic presidential nomination rivals at Tuesday night’s primary debate over her refusal to discuss whether taxes would go up for Americans to implement her proposal for a government-run ""Medicare-for-all"" plan.

Warren, D-Mass., has repeatedly refused to say whether she will raise taxes on the middle class. During Tuesday's debate, she maintained that she would lower costs for everyone except the wealthy and large corporations. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has similarly pledged to lower costs but disclosed that his plan would entail raising taxes.

Host Sandra Smith said estimates place the 10-year cost of the ""Medicare-for-all"" plans at $32-34 trillion.

Challenging night for Warren: Dems attack her on debate stage, then ‘Squad’ backs Sanders

Tuesday was arguably a bad night for rising Democratic presidential co-frontrunner Sen. Elizabeth Warren. She came under attack from all sides during Tuesday night's presidential debate and then reports surfaced that members of “The Squad” were set to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for president. Several of the candidates during the debate in Westerville, Ohio, criticized Warren for refusing to answer whether her ""Medicare for All"" plan would raise taxes for the middle class. Warren once again dodged the issue, insisting only that ""costs will go down"" for the middle class. Click here for more on this story.

But perhaps the most disheartening news for Warren came after the debate. Reports said that at least three members of the “Squad” of far-left freshman members of Congress will endorse Sanders for president. Fox News has learned that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., will appear with Sanders on Saturday in Queens, N.Y., at a “Bernie’s Back” rally designed to generate excitement for the senator’s campaign following his recent heart attack. Rep. Ihan Omar, D-Minn., issued a statement confirming her endorsement, and CNN reported that Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., will endorse Sanders as well. It was not immediately clear if Squad member Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., will endorse a candidate soon.

Biden insists he and son Hunter did nothing wrong, focus should be on Trump corruption

During Tuesday’s debate Vice President Joe Biden defiantly defended his son's business practices overseas and vehemently denied any wrongdoing. Biden had been at the top of the crowded field for months but has come under withering assault from the White House concerning his son Hunter's lucrative overseas business dealings.

CNN anchor Anderson Cooper pressed Joe Biden on Hunter's admission in a televised interview earlier in the day that he made a mistake by obtaining a lucrative role on the board of a Ukraine company, with no relevant expertise, while his father was vice president and handled Ukraine policy. Ultimately, the elder Biden insisted neither he nor Hunter did anything wrong and that the focus should be on President Trump. ""The fact of the matter is, this is about Trump's corruption. That's what we should be focused on,"" he said. Click here for more on this story.

Other highlights in the debate: All of the 12 Democrats onstage backed the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Trump. In a sign of apparent disunity and hesitation among Democrats, though, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said only minutes before the debate began that there would be no vote on formally commencing the inquiry.

Sanders stood by his claim that he would provide jobs for every single American -- ""tens of millions of Americans"" - purportedly ending unemployment in the United States. Biden, Warren, and Sanders -- who is recovering from a heart attack two weeks ago -- all faced pointed questions about their age, and health and how those factors could affect their electability and potential presidency.

The simmering bad blood between rivals South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas appeared to boil over as they continued to jab at each other. At one point, Buttigieg, who has said that O’Rourke’s gun buyback proposal could hurt Democrats appeal with moderate voters, firmly told O'Rourke: “I don’t need lessons from you on courage.”

CNN and The New York Times were widely criticized for not asking any of the 12 Democratic candidates about China during Tuesday night's presidential debate. China has made making major headlines in recent weeks between its trade war with the United States as well as the growing tensions between the communist nation and the NBA after the Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey made a tweet in support of the Hong Kong protesters.

Doug Schoen: The fourth Democratic debate's big winner, biggest loser and two surprise showings

According to Doug Schoen, a Fox News contributor and veteran Democratic pollster and consultant, Elizabeth Warren was still the big winner in the most crowded presidential debate ever held. In his analysis for Fox News Digital, Schoen said Warren showed she was sharp and prepared as she fended off attacks from candidates who were looking to cut into her polling lead -- and that only solidified her frontrunner status.

The biggest loser, according to Schoen, was Joe Biden, who needed to deliver a strong performance to reassure voters that he is ready for a general election fight against Trump. However, Schoen wrote, Biden was unable to break through and deliver the forceful showing that he needed, dodging a question regarding his son’s work with Ukraine and delivering several other uneven answers throughout the night.

Sen. Bernie Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Schoen said, were two surprise winners for delivering strong performances. Click here for more of Schoen's winners and losers from Tuesday's Democratic debate.

Elizabeth Warren came under attack from two of her Democratic presidential nomination rivals at Tuesday night’s primary debate over her refusal to discuss whether taxes would go up for Americans to implement her proposal for a government-run Medicare-for-all plan.

After being asked by the moderators early at the fourth-round debate at Otterbein University whether middle-class taxes would rise under her health care proposal, the progressive senator from Massachusetts didn’t specifically answer, instead pledging that “I will not sign a bill into law that does not cut costs for middle-class families.”

Moments later, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg took aim at Warren, who’s soared in polling in recent months and is now considered a frontrunner for the party's presidential nomination alongside former Vice President Joe Biden.

Accusing Warren of being evasive, Buttigieg argued that “your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything— except for this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multitrillion-dollar hole in this Medicare-for-all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.”

Buttigieg then touted his plan for “Medicare-for-all-who-want it,” which, unlike the Medicare-for-all proposal championed by Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, would not eliminate private insurance.

Warren, firing back at Buttigieg, said: “Let’s be clear, whenever someone hears the term 'Medicare for all who want it,' understand what that means: It’s 'Medicare for all who can afford it.' And that’s the problem we’ve got. Medicare-for-all is the gold standard.”

But Mayor Pete counterpunched: “I don’t understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans, kicking 150 million Americans off of their insurance in four short years.”

DEMOCRATS UNITE IN IMPEACHING TRUMP AT TOP OF TUESDAY'S DEMOCRATIC DEBATE, AS BIDEN DEFENDS SON

Sanders, who authored the Medicare-for-all bill in the Senate, chimed in, noting that “as somebody who wrote the damn bill, as I say, let’s be clear, under the Medicare-for-all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone. Deductibles are gone. All out-of-pocket expenses are gone.""



But then he said “it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up” before adding that “for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.”

Asked again by the moderators if she would acknowledge what Sanders had just said, that middle-class taxes would rise, Warren answered, “What I have committed to is that costs will go down for hard-working middle-class families.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar then joined Buttigieg in calling out Warren.

The Minnesota Democrat said that “at least Bernie’s being honest here in saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes will go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.”

Suggesting that Warren would never be able to pass her Medicare-for-all plan through Congress, Klobuchar said ""the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done.""

Biden also chimed in, jabbing at Warren without naming her, accusing her of not being straightforward.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

""On the single most important thing facing the American public, I think it's awfully important to be straightforward with them,"" Biden noted. ""The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget.""

And he charged that under the Sanders and Warren plan, ""if a fireman and a schoolteacher are making $100,000 a year, their taxes are going to go up about $10,000. That is more than they will possibly save on this health care plan. We have a plan put forward that will work."""

Elizabeth Warren at the Democrats’ latest debate, Joe Biden repeatedly criticized the progressive senator from Massachusetts, whose status has risen in recent months, making her a presidential primary front-runner alongside the former vice president.

In Columbus, Ohio, Biden questioned Warren’s honesty and pushed back against the media’s labeling of Warren as a ""co-front-runner.""

“I haven’t seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a front-runner,” Biden said. “You guys keep talking about that.”

JOE BIDEN'S POTENTIALLY TROUBLING CAMPAIGN CASH REPORT

Biden did acknowledge, in referencing the latest polls, that “Warren has done very well. She’s moved.”

The former vice president was the unrivaled leader of the pack in the 2020 nomination race even before he declared his candidacy in late April. But Warren, gaining stature in a field that once had some two dozen presidential hopefuls, has surged; in many of the most recent national, early-primary-state and caucus-state surveys, she’s virtually tied Biden for the top spot.

Warren’s new status was clearly on display at Tuesday night’s fourth-round nomination debate, when she came under attack from many of her rivals on the stage. Biden, who was the recipient of most of the incoming fire during the first three rounds of debates, was at times absent from the action.

RIVALS TAKE ON WARREN OVER MEDICARE-FOR-ALL, MORE, AT DEBATE

Still, Biden downplayed suggestions that he’s been eclipsed by Warren, saying on the day after the debate that “it's kind of about time other people get questioned.”

But Warren's chief campaign strategist, Joe Rospars, pointing to the attention Warren received at the debate and to new fundraising reports that potentially hint at some trouble for Biden – tweeted on Wednesday that “it’s rare that we get as much real information in one day to clarify the state of the Democratic primary as we did yesterday.”

Near the top of Tuesday’s debate, two primary rivals -- South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota -- forcefully took aim at Warren for not directly answering if she’d raise taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for her push to implement a government-run “Medicare-for-all” health care system.

On that score, Biden had this to say on Wednesday: “It’s fascinating that the person who has a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential thing in this election in the minds of the American people, across the board. And you know, credibility matters. It matters.”

""She’s going to have to tell the truth, or a question will be raised about whether she’s going to be candid and honest with the American people,” Biden said. “I don’t want to pick on Elizabeth Warren, but this is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.”

Biden, who opposes the Medicare-for-all plan long championed by more progressive rivals like Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont instead supports strengthening the Affordable Care Act with a public option.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

“The last thing the Democrats should be doing is playing (President) Trump’s game and trying to con the American people to think this is easy,""Biden said. “There’s nothing easy about it. If you’re going to do it, tell us how you’re going to do it. It’s called truth in speaking.”

Warren’s campaign told Fox News that the senator is “reviewing the revenue options suggested by the 2016 Bernie [Sanders] campaign along with other revenue options.”

Warren further emphasized at the debate that “I will not sign a bill into law that does not cut costs for middle-class families.”

Beyond health care, Biden criticized Warren for saying during the debate that “I think that we [the United States] ought to get out of the Middle East.”

Warren – who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee – appeared to suggest an end to the decades-old U.S. military presence in the volatile Mideast. Her comments came during a discussion of President Trump’s heavily criticized move to pull U.S. troops out of northeastern Syria.

While Warren has long called for reducing America’s military presence overseas, her campaign said after the debate that the candidate was talking only about combat troops.

“Senator Warren was referencing combat troops, not those stationed in the Middle East in non-combat roles. She believes we need to end the endless wars. That means working to responsibly remove U.S. troops from combat in the Middle East, and using diplomacy to work with allies and partners to end conflicts and suffering in the region,” the campaign said in a statement.

Biden, on Wednesday, said he “frankly was surprised” by Warren’s comments.

The former vice president – who repeatedly touts his foreign policy chops – added that “I had never heard any say, with any serious background on foreign policy, that we pull all troops out of the Middle East. … I’m not sure exactly what she meant by it.”

“If she meant pulling our fleet out of the eastern Mediterranean or the Persian Gulf, I think it would be an absolute disaster for American security and American foreign policy.”

Biden repeated his criticism – without naming Warren – later Wednesday when he delivered a foreign policy address in Iowa.

Given Joe Biden’s refusal to do any interviews since impeachment cast a spotlight on his family’s conduct, it was striking that he handed the ball to his son before the one forum where he couldn’t duck questions: the CNN/New York Times marathon.

And 17 minutes into the Ohio debate, when Anderson Cooper asked Biden the question, he retreated to “my son’s statement speaks for itself”—precisely the point of orchestrating the ABC interview.

JOE BIDEN DEFENDS SON HUNTER'S UKRAINE WORK: 'MY SON DID NOTHING WRONG. I DID NOTHING WRONG'

Cooper asked a key question: If Hunter Biden now says he won’t do any foreign work if his dad becomes president, why was it okay when Joe was vice president?

Biden ignored that, saying “my son did nothing wrong, I did nothing wrong,” then pivoted to denouncing Rudy Giuliani, President Trump and his “thugs” as liars. He would not acknowledge the lousy optics that even Hunter conceded.

The striking aftermath: None of the other Democrats on the stage said a negative word about Biden or his son’s lucrative deal in Ukraine. They deemed it off limits. Cory Booker defended Biden, saying no one should be “attacking a statesman.”

But Cooper also softened the question by saying “the president has made false accusations against your son” and “there is no evidence of wrongdoing by you and your son.” Why not let Biden make that case? Why appear to take sides? And is there absolutely no wrongdoing by Hunter, who was unqualified for the Ukrainian gas gig, as opposed to no evidence of criminal wrongdoing?

The only real action was on health care, though it wasn’t as exciting as the Washington Nationals scoring seven first-inning runs on their way to the World Series. In fact, that part of the debate seemed more like an old replay.

Once again, a journalist—in this case Marc Lacey of the Times—asked Elizabeth Warren if the middle class would pay more under the Medicare for All measure she is pushing.

Once again, Warren rolled out her standard response: The rich and big corporations will pay more, the middle class will pay less.

Lacey followed up—will you raise middle-class taxes?—and once again, the Massachusetts senator sidestepped: “I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.” Notice she said costs, not taxes. (Bernie Sanders, who wrote the damn bill, admits middle-class taxes will rise.)

Pete Buttigieg was more blunt, saying Warren had failed to answer a yes or no question. She dodged it again.

Amy Klobuchar, showing unusual aggressiveness, said Warren would kick 150 million Americans off their private insurance. I don’t know why the debate questioners don’t focus on this rather crucial point.

Biden said what he said in the last debate, that Medicare for All would cost $30 trillion over a decade and taxes would go up, but his rejoinder had less force.

After that, the debate settled into something of a wonkfest. What about auto jobs? Should there be a wealth tax? Can gun buybacks work? CNN’s practice of usually letting each of the 12 candidates answer the same question added to the drone factor.

Something else was at work. It’s now clear that the race has settled into a contest between Biden and Warren, with Sanders (looking vigorous despite his heart attack) continuing to slip. Everyone else has been mired in single digits for many months. So there’s far less media excitement if Kamala Harris has a strong moment or Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke get into a spat on gun control. Impeachment dominated the pregame programming, with the debate a secondary story.

The moderators, who included Erin Burnett, were fine, but could have done far more to sharpen the contrasts between the contenders.

On Trump’s pullout from northern Syria, Biden was strikingly emotional, saying of the Kurds: “They lost their lives. This is shameful, shameful, what this man has done!” Warren accused Trump of giving ISIS a new lease on life. Buttigieg called it a “betrayal.” The only dissenter was Tulsi Gabbard, who wants to end the ""endless war"" and accused CNN and the Times of smearing her.

But such brief fireworks were the exception, and that was the weakness of the debate. Far too much time was spent on the candidates denouncing Trump in unison, sometimes just changing the adjectives. That undoubtedly made Democratic viewers feel good, but did little to distinguish among the contenders.

That pattern began at the outset, when Cooper asked about impeachment. While he tried mixing up the questions—why not let the voters evict Trump instead, is impeachment a distraction?—every Democrat on the stage competed to castigate the president in stronger terms (Bernie won with “most corrupt in history""). Biden and Warren talked about the Mueller report, making clear that they were primed for impeachment before the Ukraine mess surfaced.

The only real change from the last three debates was that Biden briefly had to defend his son’s buckraking in Ukraine. Impeachment has frozen the race, and that’s bad news for anyone not named Joe or Elizabeth."

The network landed an average of 8.3 million views during the three-hour telecast. That marked quite a dip from its previous two-part debates in July, where viewership peaked at 10.7 million. CNN's debate also saw an almost 50-percent drop from the first debate hosted by NBC News back in June, which received 15.3 million viewers.

In addition, 449,000 viewers watched live streams on various platforms from CNN and The New York Times, who co-hosted the debate.

The fourth debate featured 12 candidates on one stage. They were: former Vice President Joe Biden,; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Sen. Kamala Harris of California; tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas; Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; and billionaire donor Tom Steyer.

CNN DEBATE SLAMMED BY CRITICS, CANDIDATES: 'DAMAGED THE NETWORK'S CREDIBILITY EVEN FURTHER'

CNN and The Times faced an avalanche of criticism during and after the debate. The hosting news outlets received backlash for not asking the 12 candidates about topics including China, which has made big headlines in recent weeks amid the ongoing trade war with the U.S.; the mounting tensions in Hong Kong; and the growing controversy with the NBA.

Even the candidates slammed the debate hosts. Castro blasted the debate for not asking any questions about climate change but making time for a question about Ellen DeGeneres' friendship with former President George W. Bush. Harris similarly called out the news organizations for overlooking climate change, immigration and LGBT issues.

Gabbard, however, may have had the fiercest attack, which she made on the debate stage.

""The New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime-change war,"" she said, apparently gesturing toward the moderators. ""Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia -- completely despicable.""

Dan Crenshaw, the freshman Republican congressman from Texas, defended himself Tuesday after a video showed an Illinois Democrat calling him “a racist.”

The Democrat, Rep. Sean Casten, an Irish-born lawmaker whose district covers suburbs west of Chicago, told an audience earlier this month that Crenshaw was “a racist” because the Texan proposed an amendment in Congress to prevent illegal immigrants from voting.

“The last amendment on the floor that day … came from Dan Crenshaw, the new Republican, the Navy SEAL with the eyepatch,"" Casten said, according to the Washington Free Beacon. Crenshaw is a former Navy SEAL who was wounded in combat in Afghanistan.

“He came up with an amendment to say, ‘We're going to add a rider on this bill that says that illegals can't vote.' And I sat there and I said, ‘You know what? You're not allowed to vote if you're not a citizen.’ … Why are you doing that?"" Casten continued. ""The reason you're doing that is because you are a racist. Because you are trying to appeal to people who will vote for you if you stand up and oppose brown people,"" he said.

Crenshaw responded on Twitter after video from Casten’s Oct. 5 remarks surfaced.

“When you can’t articulate a coherent argument, you resort to calling your political opponents racist,” Crenshaw wrote on Tuesday. “Can’t say I’m surprised. Just another day in Washington with the Democrat Party.”

Later, in a statement to the Free Beacon, a Crenshaw spokeswoman added: “If Rep. Casten is so deeply offended that our laws prohibit non-citizens from voting in federal elections, then he should be honest with his constituents and let them know how little he values the power of their vote.”

In a party-line vote, the Democrat-controlled House defeated Crenshaw’s proposal, the outlet reported.

Casten also made headlines in June when he came out in support of the impeachment effort against President Trump.

The Democrat also drew criticism last year when he said Trump and 9/11 mastermind Usama bin Laden “have a tremendous amount in common.”

Crenshaw, during a September appearance on Fox & Friends, accused Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders of deliberately tweeting about veterans issues in order to “make people angry.”"

ERDOGAN THREW TRUMP'S 'DON'T BE A FOOL' LETTER IN THE TRASH, SOURCES CLAIM

“As the war in Iraq draws to a close, it is my hope that this conflict will serve as a solemn reminder of the costs of war,” Waters said in a statement issued Oct. 21, 2011. “We must carefully reexamine our approach to national security and how we view the United States' role in promoting international peace and security. If we are to remain leaders in the world, we must always use our best judgment to determine when and how we engage other nations and other actors – particularly if we are considering the use of military force.”

Waters’ approach to the United States’ role in world affairs is similar to Trump’s recent warnings against “fighting other people’s wars.”

Cut to Oct. 7, 2019, and Waters blasted Trump for leaving Kurdish forces to fend for themselves against Turkish attacks.

“If the United States abandons the Kurds, these courageous allies will never trust us again,” Waters said in a statement, adding that “Trump’s betrayal of the Kurds is a gift to Russia, Iran and ISIS.”

That same day, Pelosi came out against Trump, warning that leaving northern Syria could lead to an ISIS resurgence.

DEMS STORM OUT OF SYRIA MEETING WITH TRUMP: 'WE HAVE TO PRAY FOR HIS HEALTH'

“This reckless, misguided decision undermines the efforts by our brave servicemembers and our allies to end ISIS’s tyranny,” she said.

But while Republicans had similar concerns about withdrawing from Iraq in 2011, Pelosi praised Obama “for a promise made and a promise kept, honoring the U.S.-Iraq Security Agreement and the wishes of the American people to bring all our troops home by the end this year.”

Pelosi stormed out of a meeting with Trump Wednesday after what she said was a ""meltdown"" by the president.

One of the Democratic frontrunners for the 2020 presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was also critical of Trump, despite being historically anti-war.

“You don’t turn your back on an ally that lost 11,000 troops fighting against terrorism through a tweet and a discussion with Erdogan,” Sanders told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. This criticism came despite Sanders acknowledgment that “I am a strong opponent of endless wars.”

That position was made evident in 2011 when Sanders backed Obama’s Iraq withdrawal.

“I applaud the president's decision and have been advocating that position for quite a while,” adding, “Now is the time to bring our troops home, lower our military budget, and use those funds to create jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure and lowering our national debt.""

On Thursday, Trump vented about Democratic criticism. ""I am the only person who can fight for the safety of our troops & bring them home from the ridiculous & costly Endless Wars, and be scorned. Democrats always liked that position, until I took it,"" he said.

Republicans have been equally critical of Trump, with 129 GOP members voting for a resolution in opposition to the withdrawal, joining a unanimous Democratic contingent. Sen. Lindsey Graham has been particularly vocal, leading Trump to accuse the senator of wanting to “stay in the Middle East for the next 1,000 years.”

Graham, however, was no supporter of Obama, and lumped Trump and his predecessor together in making what he believes to be critical foreign policy errors.

“President Trump is being told EXACTLY what President Obama was told before he withdrew from Iraq,” Graham tweeted Wednesday. “He appears to be hell-bent on making the same mistakes in Syria as President Obama made in Iraq.”"

Barely registering the polls and with less than $700,000 of campaign cash on hand, the former San Antonio, Texas mayor who later served as Housing and Urban Development secretary under President Barack Obama is facing the possibility that his appearance at the debate at Otterbein University in suburban Columbus, Ohio may well be the last time he makes the stage.

BUTTIGIEG AND O'ROURKE CLASH OVER GUNS DURING DEBATE

Castro grabbed only 8.2 minutes of speaking time at the debate – the third least amount among the record-setting 12 candidates on the stage – and didn’t score a breakout moment.

But in an interview with Fox News in the spin room following the debate, Castro vowed that he’ll fight on even if fails to make November’s cut and optimistically said he’ll qualify for the next debate.

“I’m going to keep fighting on. I believe that with hard work, we can make the next debate in Atlanta. We have about three and a half weeks to do that. So I’m going to keep working hard to get there,” he said.

Castro’s comments stand in contrast to his dire warning to supporters in a fundraising email late last week.

""I don’t say this lightly: If I don’t make the next debate stage, it will be the end of my campaign,"" Castro emphasized.

FOX NEWS' BRETT BAIER ON DEBATE WINNERS AND LOSERS

To date, eight candidates say they’ve qualified: They are – in alphabetical order – are former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, businessman and progressive and environmental advocate Tom Steyer, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

After the debate, it was hard to find a political pundit who praised Castro’s performance.

But asked by Fox News if his debate performance helped him in his goal to make the next debate stage, the candidate said, “I think so. It’s always a scramble for time with 12 people up there but I made the best use of the time that I did get. I was very sharp on issues that people care about and I think that will make a difference.”

And he touted on Twitter that “donations are coming in from all around the country.”

Castro also took aim at the media hosts for the debate - CNN and the New York Times – telling reporters in the spin room and highlighting on Twitter that there were “three hours and no questions tonight about climate, housing, or immigration. Climate change is an existential threat. America has a housing crisis. Children are still in cages at our border.”"

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at the fourth round Democratic presidential nomination debate, but the former vice president has a potentially larger headache – a lack of campaign cash.

As Biden was on the debate stage Tuesday night, his third quarter of fundraising filing to the Federal Election Commission was making headlines.

BIDEN'S THIRD QUARTER FUNDRAISING HAUL A WARNING SIGN

According to the report, Biden had just under $9 million in his campaign coffers after spending more money than he raised during the July-September fundraising quarter. That’s far less than Warren, who reported $25.7 million cash on hand, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, another top tier rival who reported having $33.7 million in the bank.

Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield, pressed on the report, told reporters in the spin room after the debate in suburban Columbus, Ohio that “it’s more important how you spend the money than how you raise it.""

And she emphasized that “we have resources that we need to continue to run our race. We’ve always said we think this race is going to be a dogfight, that it’s going to go long. We’re building an operation that is going to be sustained.”

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

On Wednesday, Biden said he was confident he had the fundraising to make it to the general election.

“Our fundraising is building. We've raised a lot of money online. And we've raised money offline as well, so we feel confident we're going to be ready,” he told reporters at a campaign event in Ohio.

And taking aim at Warren – who transferred more than $10 million from her 2018 Senate re-election campaign to her White House bid – Biden noted he “did not start off by dropping $10 million from a Senate campaign, wherever that money was raised from, into a race.”

It was just two weeks ago that Biden was left in the dust by Warren, Sanders, and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg when it came to their third-quarter fundraising hauls. And unlike Warren and Sanders – who’ve brought in most of their money from small-dollar grassroots donations -- much of Biden’s money comes from top-dollar fundraising events with big-bucks donors.

A Democratic consultant who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely called the $15.2 million Biden raised in the third quarter “a devastating number.”

Taking an indirect shot at Biden, Warren campaign chief strategist Joe Rospars highlighted the new data released Tuesday.

“The FEC report data are pretty stark. There’s nowhere to hide from the reality of the dollars and the calendar in front of us,” Rospars tweeted on Wednesday. “Is a campaign’s fundraising growing? Is its spending able to grow going into the early contests, as it must? For Warren, the answers are yes and yes.”

Democratic operative Michael Ceraso described the new Biden cash on hand figure as troubling.

Ceraso, who worked on Sanders’ 2016 campaign and who parted ways this summer with the Buttigieg campaign, warned that Biden needs to remain in the top tier conversation or “his cash flow may dry up as the primary enters the homestretch, which may prevent the VP from competing and challenging his opponents in Super Tuesday states and beyond.”

Biden is spending money at a greater rate than the amount he raised left him, with a burn rate of 112 percent. Warren’s burn rate - the pace at which candidates are spending their campaign cash – was a much more modest 76 percent.

Republicans spotlighted Biden’s campaign cash on hand figures as a warning sign for a candidate who has already relinquished his status as the unrivaled front-runner in the polls.

“Biden’s money problems are now a crisis for the campaign and if he doesn’t turn it around soon, he’ll end up on the sidelines sooner than anyone anticipated,” emphasized Joe Gierut, press secretary for the pro-Republican America Rising PAC.

Fundraising is far from definitive, but like polling, it’s an important barometer of a candidate’s momentum and his or her campaign’s strength. Among the things funds can be used for are building staff and grassroots outreach efforts in the crucial early voting states and running TV, radio, and digital ads.

Biden ‘eclipsed’ on 2020 debate stage

The spotlight on the former vice president’s campaign cash numbers came as the spotlight at the debate shifted from him to Warren, who has soared in recent months and is now tied in most national and early voting state polling with Biden for the top spot in the nomination race.

Biden was front-and-center as the debate kicked off, focusing on the Ukrainian controversy and the impeachment inquiry.

But when the conversation turned to the battle over ""Medicare-for-all,"" the former vice president was mostly absent from the discussion as the spotlight shifted to Warren.

The populist senator, who has produced one progressive policy proposal after another, grabbed the most speaking time in the debate, roughly six more minutes than Biden, who was second.

“He faded at times,” noted Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of the Georgetown University’s Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor. ""He popped his head up occasionally.

“He did allow himself to get eclipsed by some others, like Buttigieg and (Sen. Amy) Klobuchar and some of the others,” added Elleithee, a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign who later steered communications for the Democratic National Committee. “He’s got to step up. He cannot miss opportunities and I think he missed a few.”

GOP strategist and presidential campaign veteran Colin Reed called Biden “nearly invisible” at the debate and said it’s “a sign of how far this campaign has fallen that no one bothers to go after him.”

But Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a top Biden friend and 2020 surrogate, told reporters in the spin room on Tuesday night that being out of the spotlight benefitted Biden.

“Unlike previous debates where the vast majority of the attention was focused on testing or challenging Vice President Biden, tonight was a night when Sen. Warren’s plans on a wide range of issues – from the wealth tax to 'Medicare-for-all' – came under repeated questioning,” Coons highlighted.

Biden echoed that sentiment on Wednesday, saying ""it's kind of about time other people get questioned.""

And he pushed back on the labeling of Warren as a co-front-runner, saying “I haven’t seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a frontrunner.”

Once again, the debate stage showcased a lackluster group of extremist politicians pandering to their far-left base of support with harmful policy proposals that are way outside the mainstream.

The three septuagenarian candidates currently making up the top tier of the Democratic field include a confused and corrupt former Vice President Joe Biden some 20 years past his prime; unelectable socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who recently suffered a heart attack; and hopelessly out-of-touch former Harvard professor and current Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who wants to throw 180 million Americans off their private health insurance plans, including union workers.

Stuck with a field marred with enormous electability questions, no one is paying closer attention to the weakest field of presidential candidates in recent memory than 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

WARREN COMES UNDER ATTACK FROM ALL SIDES AT DEM DEBATE, AS BIDEN DEFENDS SON'S BUSINESS PRACTICES

These two nationally recognized liberals are likely thinking the same thing as everyone else: none of the 12 mediocre candidates on the stage in Ohio Tuesday night has what it takes to defeat President Trump in November 2020.

After watching the three-hour snooze fest, here are some of the takeaways that Clinton and Bloomberg may be thinking about as they consider jumping into the presidential race.

The Democratic candidates are desperately lurching farther and farther to the left. This strategy of embracing extremism is clearly designed to capture the hearts and minds of the Democratic primary electorate by repackaging the tired Big Government policies of the past. Capitalism and liberty have become dirty words with this crowd. Look no further than new reports Tuesday night that Green New Deal author and socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York – along with radical Reps. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota – plan to endorse Sanders for president. Throughout history, socialism has failed at every turn and will fail once again as the Democrat’s party platform in the 2020 general election.

Joe Biden’s son Hunter and his shady foreign business dealings were glossed over and badly mischaracterized. This should have been the big issue of the night. Serious allegations against the Bidens are being whitewashed by a biased mainstream media that has gone headfirst into the dishonesty tank during the Trump administration.

The impeachment witch hunt led the discussion because the Democratic Party has no positive agenda. All the candidates reminded viewers about the partisan nature of the baseless impeachment inquiry against President Trump by rushing to judgment before getting the facts. It’s become clear that impeachment is being pushed because desperate Democrats can’t defeat Trump at the ballot box in less than 13 months.

Democrats are offering the American people big tax increases, job-killing over-regulation, and lawless open borders. These failed and harmful ideas aren’t polling well with voters. But the far-left Democrats are so committed to Big Government that they ignore the fact that their plans would wreck the vibrant Trump economy and punish American families and businesses.

“Medicare-for-all,” championed by Sanders, is so extreme that even some of the Democratic presidential candidates oppose it. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., pointed out that the disastrous proposal would result in a “multitrillion-dollar hole” in the federal budget. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota called the irresponsible plan a “pipedream.” They’re both right.

The debate will not change the trajectory of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Nothing happened to suggest someone had a breakout moment and will show real upward movement in the polls. The top tier will remain Warren, Biden and Sanders.

Despite the best efforts of Democrats, President Trump’s amazing accomplishments to improve the lives of the American people simply cannot be explained away. The national unemployment rate of 3.5 percent is at a 50-year low and the unemployment rates for women, African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans are at historic lows. Over 6 million jobs have been created on President Trump’s watch – including 500,000 manufacturing jobs – and a record number of Americans are currently employed. To paraphrase former President Bill Clinton, elections are about the strong economy – and continued prosperity.

In a debate that featured barely a spark – much less fireworks – there’s ample reason for Democratic power brokers around the country to be concerned about where the current overcrowded field is headed. So they might be looking for other options before the Iowa caucuses kick off voting for the presidential candidates in February.

Here’s the reality:

Job creators, entrepreneurs and investors alike know that President Trump at his core thinks like a pro-growth businessman, and that gives them confidence to make decisions that expand their businesses.

On trade, President Trump’s vision and leadership have changed opinions on how we approach China, Mexico, Canada, and the European Union. The president knows there is a difference between free trade and fair trade when it comes to prioritizing American workers.

In Tuesday night’s debate in the critical Rust Belt state of Ohio – as the Democrats highlighted their failed vision of tax increases, overregulation, and giving away the store to China – the contrast with the positive Trump record couldn’t be starker.

Well-known liberal egotists Clinton and Bloomberg certainly think a lot of themselves and despite their baggage could probably fare better against President Trump than the current slate of boring Democrat wannabes.

And if the Democrats really want to recreate the 2008 Obama coalition, there’s another candidate who could immediately become the party’s frontrunner due to nostalgia alone. Her name is Michelle Obama. But the problem with nostalgia is that we tend to remember what we liked and forget what we didn’t like.

The clear reality emerging at the end of the long debate was that these are desperate times for a Democratic Party suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome.

WELCOME TO THE THUNDERDOME, ELIZABETH WARREN

WaPo: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose steady stream of plans have propelled her to the top of the Democratic presidential field, came under sustained attack for the first time during a raucous primary debate here Tuesday that revealed Democrats’ ongoing public struggle to define their beliefs and choose a standard-bearer to take on President Trump. Warren (Mass.) faced direct challenges from several of the 11 other candidates onstage, who took her on over her policies, her fitness to serve as commander in chief and her willingness to question the motives of Democrats who support less transformational ideas. … The focus on Warren deflected attention from others facing scrutiny entering Tuesday’s debate, which was hosted by CNN and the New York Times. Former vice president Joe Biden went for long stretches without surfacing… Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), meanwhile, showed no signs of lingering health trouble.”



Klobuchar, Buttigieg shone through - National Review: “The October Democratic presidential-primary debate finally brought a genuine surprise, in that a pair of second-tier candidates who were in danger of being forgotten woke up, smelled the coffee, and brought their A-games: Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg. Considering how other second-tier candidates have turned in good performances in past months and seen little movement in the polls, this may not be a turning point in the race for either candidate. But in a way-too-long, often-boring debate that was stuck in the middle of an otherwise jam-packed news environment, Klobuchar and Buttigieg managed to stand out.”



Sanders and Warren have deep pockets as Biden burns cash - AP: “Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren don’t just lead the Democratic presidential primary in fundraising. They’ve stockpiled millions more than their rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden, who burned through money at a fast clip over the past three months while posting an anemic fundraising haul. Sanders held $33.7 million cash on hand on his third-quarter fundraising report. Warren had $25.7 million during the same period, while South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg came next $23.3 million. Biden, meanwhile, held just $8.9 million, a small fraction of what his leading rivals have at their disposal. With the first votes of the Democratic contest just months away, the candidates are entering a critical and expensive period when having an ample supply of cash can make or break a campaign. Biden’s total raises questions about his durability as a front-runner.”



Squad to endorse Sanders - Fox News: “Three members of the so-called ‘Squad’ of far-left freshman members of Congress are lining up behind Sen. Bernie Sanders for president. Fox News has learned that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., will appear with Sanders on Saturday in Queens, N.Y., at a ‘Bernie’s Back’ rally designed to generate excitement for the senator’s campaign following his recent heart procedure. Rep. Ihan Omar, D-Minn., will also endorse the candidate, Fox News confirmed. In addition, CNN reported that Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., will endorse Sanders as well. It was not immediately clear if Omar and Tlaib will appear at Saturday's event. … The endorsements would be a significant blow to the campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren…”



Steyer spending stupendous - WSJ: “Billionaire Tom Steyer appeared on the Democratic presidential debate stage for the first time Tuesday night, but voters in early states have already seen him on TV thousands of times. Mr. Steyer, who new federal filings show has poured nearly $48 million of his own money into his long-shot bid, is dominating television screens in the first four states that will hold nominating contests early next year. Since entering the race in July, Mr. Steyer has spent more than $26 million on TV ads, airing more than 53,000 spots in markets that reach Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada voters, data from ad-tracking firm Kantar/CMAG shows. All told, that is more than six times as many as the rest of the Democratic field combined.”



THE RULEBOOK: DEMOCRACY AND CHILL

“Where the whole power of the government is in the hands of the people, there is the less pretense for the use of violent remedies in partial or occasional distempers of the State.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 21



TIME OUT: AN INVENTOR’S SLAP SHOT

Smithsonian: “Invented by Frank Zamboni, the eponymous ice-clearing machine celebrates its 70th anniversary this year. He applied for his first U.S. patent in 1949, for this innovative idea that totally transformed winter sports by giving chopped-up ice surfaces a fresh-frozen smoothness in a matter of minutes. ‘At the time, he was just trying to address a need of his,’ says Frank Zamboni, the inventor’s grandson and now president of the Zamboni Company. ‘He saw a need for the ice rink he owned with his brother and cousins… Instead of taking 1 1/2 hours to clean the ice, that was time somebody could be paying to skate on it.’ Contrary to popular belief, the Zamboni machine was not invented in Canada—the place of snow and ice—but in Southern California—the land of sun and fun. … As time went on, he saw a need to quickly clean the ice, so he started improvising with war-surplus equipment.”

PELOSI STILL NOT BITING ON IMPEACHMENT VOTE

Politico: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leaders will hold off on a full House vote authorizing an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, according to multiple lawmakers and aides. Democratic leadership sources caution, however, that the decision could be ‘reassessed at some point.’ The move came amid opposition from key chairmen and members of leadership, as well as a number of centrist Democrats facing tough reelection bids. Trump, White House officials and Republicans on Capitol Hill have seized on the absence of such a vote as an unacceptable break with House precedent and have vowed to resist what they describe as an illegitimate probe. But Democrats defended their current impeachment process, which has multiple House committees interviewing witnesses in private and gathering evidence related to allegations that Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, pressured Ukrainian officials to begin an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son — potentially at the risk of losing U.S. military aid.”



Gallup: Majority now supports removing Trump from office - Gallup: “Public opinion on whether Trump should be impeached remains mixed, but Americans now lean slightly more in favor of impeachment and removal from office compared with where they stood in June. Currently, 52% say Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 46% say he should not be. This is roughly the opposite of what Gallup found in June when asked in the context of special counselor Robert Mueller's investigation.”



Staffers fear White House seeking scapegoat on Ukraine call - NYT: “President Trump has for weeks sought to unmask the whistle-blower who shed light on his Ukraine dealings. But instead aides have fixated on one another: Advisers began a fact-finding review that some fear is a hunt for a scapegoat, according to White House aides and other people familiar with it. Even as the impeachment inquiry intensifies in Congress, White House lawyers are leading their own review, the people said. They are seeking to understand White House officials’ actions around Mr. Trump’s July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, which is central to the whistle-blower’s allegation that Mr. Trump abused his power. The lawyers’ inquiry centers on why one of their colleagues, the deputy White House counsel John A. Eisenberg, placed a rough transcript of the call in a computer system typically reserved for the country’s most closely guarded secrets. Mr. Trump later directed that a reconstructed transcript be released amid intensifying scrutiny from House Democrats.”



Mulvaney emerges as key figure in impeachment probe - WaPo: “In late May, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney organized a meeting that stripped control of the country’s relationship with Ukraine from those who had the most expertise at the National Security Council and the State Department. Instead, Mulvaney put an unlikely trio in charge of managing the U.S.-Ukraine account amid worrisome signs of a new priority, congressional officials said Tuesday: pressuring the fledgling government in Kiev to deliver material that would be politically valuable to President Trump. The work of those ‘three amigos,’ as they came to call themselves — diplomats Gordon Sondland and Kurt Volker, plus Energy Secretary Rick Perry — has come to light in recent days through newly disclosed text messages and the testimony of government witnesses appearing before an impeachment inquiry in Congress.”



BEVIN RECOVERS IN KENTUCKY POLL

WYMT: “The Mason-Dixon Kentucky Poll was released early Wednesday morning, and the results are interesting. The poll shows that statewide, 46 percent of likely voters support Republican Governor Matt Bevin, while 46 percent back Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear. At the beginning of the year, Beshear held a 48 percent-40 percent lead over Bevin, but the incumbent has pulled into a tie with his challenger. One percent of respondents voted for Libertarian nominee John Hicks, while seven percent were undecided. The poll also shows Bevin's GOP support grew from 67 percent in December to 77 percent. He is pulling in 22 percent of Democrat respondents for the cross-over vote, while Beshear is drawing 15 percent from Republicans. Among the Mason-Dixon poll participants, Bevin led among men, older voters and rural voters. … The poll credits some of Bevin's resurgence to President Donald Trump's popularity in Kentucky and resistance to his impeachment.”



Second debate was heavy with personal attacks - Louisville Courier Journal: “Republican incumbent Matt Bevin and Democratic challenger Andy Beshear had their ugliest public exchange Tuesday at the second gubernatorial debate of the fall campaign. Throughout the discussion, hosted before a raucous crowd of supporters on the University of Kentucky campus, the two rivals called each other liars and regularly interrupted one another as they were peppered with policy questions. When moderators asked about ways they would encourage students to pursue a career in public education, including the state's colleges and universities, the conversation took a turn into the gutter. … The high stakes debate touched on health care, pension reform, medical marijuana and supporting out-of-work coal miners. But it underscored how Kentucky's race for governor this year is defined by Bevin and Beshear's enmity as much as their deep differences on tackling the state's woes.”

AUDIBLE: THANKS?

“[Amy Klobuchar] had some smart answers. I’m starting not to care that she is brutal to her staff.” – Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, writing in Politico about the Democrats’ debate.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“If Trump is impeached and the Senate is mad at him, votes him out, then the GOP could have a primary too. That would take up a lot of news from the Democrats. I think we need a law for 6 months of elections, period.” – Karen Morrow, Tampa, Fla.



[Ed. note: It would be a comfort to have such constraints, it’s true. But our Constitution just wouldn’t allow for it. The government can’t tell people when they can talk about issues, therefore there’s no way to keep candidates from campaigning and reporters from reporting. I’m increasingly in favor, though, of doing away with primary elections. Our 40-year experiment with them has been a miserable bust and has unnecessarily prolonged our election calendars. Bring back conventions and spare the American people!]



“I have pretty much come to the opinion that two things will happen…one, the 2020 election is not going to be over on election night (owing to huge court battles to follow many very close races) and…two, at some point our Agitator-in-Chief is going to leave office of his own volition…having become tired of the battle and wanting to go back to his business dealings and such. What say youse (that’s a Michigan (born & raised there) UP term)?” – Rick Randell, Bradenton, Fla.



[Ed. note: I say that I know better not to say, Mr. Randell! I think there are lots of potential scenarios for 2020 that could still be in the offing. We may yet see a landslide or even, dare I say, a political realignment. As for Trump leaving early, it’s pretty hard for me to fathom. I doubt he’d give his enemies the pleasure.]

SLÁINTE, MR. BRADLEY

HuffPo: “A man in Dublin, Ireland, decided to inject a little humor into his funeral Saturday by playing a prank on his loved ones. Shay Bradley, a Defense Forces veteran who died Oct. 8 ‘after a long illness bravely borne’ according to his obituary, shocked then delighted funeralgoers when they suddenly heard his voice shouting from his coffin as it was being lowered into the ground. ‘Hello? Hello. Hello? Let me out!’ stunned attendees heard in a prerecorded message that also included ‘knocking’ against the coffin’s lid. … Those at the funeral can be seen giggling and wiping away tears as Bradley’s voice begins to sing: ‘Hello again, hello. Hello, I just called to say goodbye.’ His daughter Andrea Bradley told HuffPost that her father recorded the audio about a year ago — and that no one really knew about it other than her brother Jonathan and her nephew, Ben. Two days before Shay Bradley’s funeral, Jonathan Bradley decided to tell his mom and the rest of his siblings about the prank. He told them that playing the audio at the funeral was his dad’s dying wish.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“My non-baseball friends are forever puzzled by my devotion to the game. I agree entirely with them about the irrationality of fandom. … It’s ridiculous. Yet when the hometown Washington Nationals win, my mood brightens. Can’t help it.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on April 21, 2016.

""The big loser... was Joe Biden,"" she said. ""It was incredibly telling that all of the fire that was taken on stage was by Elizabeth Warren, and not Joe Biden -- indicating that even Democrats on that stage know that Biden is finished and that Warren is the new frontrunner.""

Sanders claimed Warren's ascension is a net positive for Trump and said her new position as frontrunner will rebrand her as the face of the party, to the detriment of other Democrats.

""She is the new face of the Democrat party,"" Sanders said. ""That is a great contrast for this president. And I think it sets him up very nicely for re-election in November.""

Sanders also said the questioning at Tuesday's primary debate was ""pathetic"" and slanted, in an effort to drag down Trump and exonerate Biden.

This was good news, you see, because it shows she’s the real front-runner. Forget that Biden guy.

“Warren’s Charmed Campaign Just Entered a Brutal New Phase,” warns Politico.

Except, well, it wasn’t really that brutal. The disagreements at Tuesday’s CNN/New York Times debate were relatively civil policy spats. No one went after her character.

BIDEN DEFLECTS QUESTIONS ON SON AS CNN ANCHOR HITS TRUMP'S 'FALSE ACCUSATIONS'

What’s more, the candidates challenging Warren are also-rans, mired in the single digits. So that lessens the impact of those exchanges.

Two of them had very good nights. Amy Klobuchar, shedding her Minnesota Nice approach, repeatedly challenged Warren, the first to point out that her Medicare for All plan would boot 150 million Americans off private insurance. I don’t know why the moderators don’t stress that, because Warren is outplaying them in one debate after another.

Marc Lacey of the Times tried three separate times to get Warren to concede what Bernie Sanders already has, that middle-class taxes would rise under her plan. And three times Warren deflected the question by saying the rich and big corporations would pay more for health care and the middle class would pay less, evading the tax question entirely.

It took Pete Buttigieg to call out Warren for failing to answer a simple yes-or-no question. He had perhaps his best debate of the campaign, making an eloquent pitch for moderate ideas. And his strongest moment came in an exchange on Beto O’Rourke’s gun buyback program, when he said: “I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.” Buttigieg, of course, is an Afghanistan war veteran.

On the other hand, he only whacked Beto, who’s going nowhere fast.

Politico’s lead story says: “The candidate who brags about having a plan for everything was pilloried for not detailing how she would pay for her most expensive proposal. She was accused — sometimes subtly, sometimes explicitly — of being naive, dishonest, not adequately respecting her colleagues’ ideas, tearing people down, and failing to enact major legislation. She was attacked for believing in policies that were “punitive” and a theory of governing that was a ‘pipe dream.’”

The debate just wasn’t as rough as that lead made it sound. After all, they ended by talking about Ellen.

The Washington Post declared Warren one of its winners:

“For the first time in one of these debates, Warren found herself under sustained attack. Through a combination of debate format, Joe Biden’s leads in early polls and Warren’s unique political Teflon, she had somehow avoided it. That changed Tuesday, though. Warren was the focal point, with the other candidates all but taking their focus thoroughly off Biden. It wasn’t completely smooth sailing for Warren…but it was an affirmation that she is viewed as perhaps the front-runner now.”

Look, the reason Warren has had such a smooth ride—besides running a very good, issues-based campaign—is that the press pretty much loves her. I’ve lost track of the number of puffy profiles about how she found her voice in Oklahoma, at Harvard, as a bankruptcy lawyer, at the consumer protection agency. She is getting one-hundredth of the media scrutiny that’s been aimed at Biden, who is not a press favorite.

When that changes, you’ll know she’s the front-runner.

As for Biden, he had some strong moments, especially on Syria, but his answers about his son were weak—especially since Hunter Biden confessed to poor judgment on ABC that morning even as his dad was touting his judgment that night. Biden caught a break when Anderson Cooper followed up only once and none of the other Democrats wanted to go there.

The media consensus is that Biden had another uneven night, and he does have a tendency to trip over his words. And yet, despite poor debate reviews and having to play defense on Ukraine, he keeps holding onto his supporters.

The bottom line is that the impeachment drama will quickly drown out this debate, whose 8.3 million viewers represent another decline. There won’t be days of stories about Klobuchar or Buttigieg that might ordinarily give them a chance to break through. If either is to have a shot at becoming Warren’s main moderate rival, the Biden campaign will essentially have to collapse.

Footnote: As if to underscore my point, the dustup between Trump and Democratic leaders--with the president calling the speaker a ""third-rate politician""--bumped the Ohio debate way down on many cable news shows."

Trent Brown, who is in his first season with the Oakland Raiders, was accused of slapping Diorra Marzette-Sanders across the mouth leaving her “bruised, bloodied and battered,” according to Pro Football Talk. Brown is also accused of threatening to shoot Marzette-Sanders in the “f-----g head.”

Here's what you need to know as you start your Thursday ...

BREAKING NEWS: U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md. and House Oversight Committee chairman, died early Thursday at age 68, according to his office. Cummings' office released a statement, saying, ""At approximately 2:45 a.m. on Thursday Oct. 17, 2019, Congressman Elijah E. Cummings (MD-07) passed away at Johns Hopkins Hospital due to complications concerning longstanding health challenges."" Stay with Fox News for further developments

Pelosi, Trump accuse each other of 'meltdown' after Dems storm out of Syria meeting

One thing is clear after top Democrats stormed out of a White House meeting with President Trump on Wednesday: The tension between the president and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has reached a boiling point -- and now observers wonder if they’ll ever be able to work together.

Afterward, Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer held an impromptu news conference outside the White House, telling reporters they walked out of the meeting on Syria policy after Trump allegedly called Pelosi either a ""third-rate politician"" or ""third-grade politician"" and angrily suggested the Democrats probably appreciated communist Islamic State terrorists in the Middle East.

""What we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown, sad to say,"" Pelosi, D-Calif., said. She added later, at the Capitol: ""I pray for the president all the time, and I tell him that -- I pray for his safety and that of his family. Now, we have to pray for his health -- because this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president.""

A senior Democratic aide told Fox News that Trump began the meeting by remarking that ""someone wanted this meeting so I agreed to it."" Trump also reportedly told Pelosi, ""I hate ISIS more than you do,"" prompting Pelosi to respond, ""You don't know that."" The meeting devolved after that point, according to several sources. As the Democrats walked out, Trump reportedly remarked, ""I'll see you at the polls.""

Trump, for his part, tweeted photos from the meeting, including one showing Pelosi standing across the table from him and pointing her finger at the president. Trump captioned the photo, ""Nervous Nancy's unhinged meltdown!"" (Pelosi later used that photo on her official Twitter account.) Click here for more on this story.

Trump tells Turkey’s Erdogan, ‘Don’t be a tough guy,’ ahead of visit from Pence, Pompeo: Before the dramatic developments at the White House, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday he will speak to Vice President Mike Pence and a U.S. delegation heading to Ankara over a potential ceasefire deal in Syria after apparently snubbing the group earlier in the morning. Pence, heading a U.S. contingent that includes Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien, was set to arrive in Turkey on Thursday. House lawmakers overwhelmingly approved a bipartisan resolution opposing Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. forces from northern Syria. Fox Business' Trish Regan exclusively obtained a letter from Trump to Erdogan, urging him, “Don’t be a tough guy. Don’t be a fool,” and ""work out a good deal!""

Biden ramps up attacks on Warren, dismisses her as a fellow front-runner

One day after arguably being overshadowed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren at the Democrats’ debate in Ohio, Joe Biden downplayed her recent gains in the polls and repeatedly criticized the progressive senator from Massachusetts. In Columbus, Ohio, Biden questioned Warren’s honesty and pushed back against the media’s labeling of her as a ""co-front-runner."" “I haven’t seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a front-runner,” Biden said. “You guys keep talking about that.”

Biden's new attacks on Warren come as it appears every member of the ""Squad"" may not be ""all in"" on endorsing Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., just yet.

Rick Perry contacted Giuliani at Trump's direction on concerns about Ukraine corruption: Wall Street Journal

Energy Secretary Rick Perry, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, said President Trump directed him to seek out his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani this spring to address the president's concerns about alleged Ukrainian corruption. The Journal reported that Perry ""said he contacted Mr. Giuliani in an effort to ease a path to a meeting between Mr. Trump and his new Ukrainian counterpart"" and that there were concerns about Ukraine's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Perry told the Journal he never heard Trump or Giuliani discuss the possibility of investigating Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Megyn Kelly calls on NBC to have 'outside investigator' probe shocking sex allegations

In her first televised interview since leaving NBC News last year, Megyn Kelly told Fox News’ Tucker Carlson that the Peacock Network needs an ""outside investigator"" to probe the shocking sexual misconduct allegations made by some former NBC employees. ""There needs to be an outside investigation into this company,” Kelly told Carlson. “They investigated themselves. That doesn't work.”

In his new book, ""Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators,"" Pulitzer-winning journalist Ronan Farrow details the resistance he says he faced from his former bosses at NBC News while reporting on disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein. The book exposes several allegations against former “Today” anchor Matt Lauer. Farrow contends top executives knew about the accusations longer than they claimed and were intent on quashing allegations of sexual misconduct by Weinstein and simultaneously keeping a lid on claims against Lauer.

“The refs need to be investigated. This is horrendous. Check bank accounts. #NoExcuses,” he wrote.

Howard also lamented that Aaron Rodgers leading the Packers to a comeback win over Lions was going to be overshadowed by the officials – who took a major beating from players and social media.

“It is a damn shame that the brilliance of @AaronRodgers12 will take a backseat to TWO ridiculous calls by the officials. He made TWO of the best throws you will see all season.”

DETROIT LIONS PLAYERS, HALL OF FAMER CRITICIZE OFFICIATING AFTER CLOSE LOSS TO GREEN BAY PACKERS

Howard, who won Super Bowl XXXI’s MVP award as a member of the Packers, was not the only person to scrutinize the referees during the game. Hall of Fame running back Barry Sanders also voiced his opinion on the matter.

“That is sickening... the @NFL needs to look at a way to prevent that from happening. Two phantom hands to the face calls really hurts us tonight. Yes, we could have scored TDs, but @Lions played too well to have the game end this way,” Sanders wrote in a tweet.

The issues stemmed from an unnecessary roughness penalty on Lions defensive back Tracy Walker and an illegal contact penalty on defensive end Trey Flowers.

While referee Clint Blakeman defended Walker’s penalty, NFL executive Troy Vincent said Tuesday the Flowers penalty should not have been called.

It is being replaced by a new Democratic-Socialist Party.

If you think I exaggerate, consider these examples.

Imagine what would have happened if any candidate in the debate had the courage (or lack of sense) to actively defend President Bill Clinton’s policies on welfare reform, capital gains tax cuts and balanced federal budgets, or his 1996 State of the Union assertion that “the era of Big Government is over.”

RONNA MCDANIEL: FOURTH DEMOCRATIC DEBATE WAS ANOTHER WIN FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND GOP

Imagine that any candidate had agreed with President Barack Obama’s original 2008 position that “I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.”

Or imagine that a candidate had defended ObamaCare as the solution to health care in America.

When the last two Democratic presidents can no longer be defended by the men and women hoping to become the next Democratic president, something profound has happened.

We have already seen the old Democratic Party (and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Rep. James Clyburn of South Caroline literally represent the old Democratic Party) being eclipsed by “the Squad.”

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York is now the spiritual leader of House Democrats. And every major Democratic presidential candidate has endorsed radical Green New Deal-type proposals that would expand government, destroy the energy industry, radically change America, and plunge the economy into a depression.

The Democratic-Socialist Party wants to outlaw private health insurance, punish the successful (especially the wealthy), and expand government control over virtually everything.

In 2020, every Democratic candidate will be faced with the challenge of defending a national party that is now the Democratic-Socialist Party.

The Democratic-Socialist candidates embrace policies ranging from wanting to confiscate guns; forcing the radical California gender curriculum on every state; removing the tax exemption for every church, synagogue, and mosque that defines marriage as between a man and a woman; providing free (meaning taxpayer-funded) health care to people living in our country illegally; and opening the border so anyone and everyone will be able to enter the United States without having to worry about immigration laws.

Some of these radical candidates favor tax-paid sex-change operations in prison – and genderless prisons (one of Biden’s contributions to the dialogue) so male criminals could declare themselves female to be sent to women’s prisons.

Imagine that one of the candidates had said he or she was against abortion. The result might have been a riot – and at a minimum an expulsion of the heretic. Instead, the new Democratic-Socialist Party stands for abortion on the last day of pregnancy, and its most radical acolytes are now for infanticide after delivery as long as “the infant would be kept comfortable” (see the New York state law endorsed by the Democratic governor of Virginia).

Almost equally heretical would have been a candidate defending Columbus Day (favored by 57 percent to 29 percent of the public, with the Democratic-Socialists once again in a position favored by about a quarter of the country).

Imagine that candidate attacking the National Education Association’s pledge that “educators must acknowledge the existence of White supremacy culture as a primary root cause of institutional racism, structural racism, and White privilege. ...the Association will actively advocate for social and educational strategies fostering the eradication of institutional racism and White privilege perpetuated by White supremacy culture.”

White supremacy culture is left-wing code for American history, American exceptionalism, the rule of law, the Constitution, and the various habits and patterns that made America the most prosperous and powerful nation in history.

Can you imagine one of the candidates in the debate arguing that our schools should not be centers of anti-American indoctrination dictated by left-wing unions? Of course not. They would be booed off the stage.

As The Wall Street Journal put it in an editorial headlined “Warren and Sanders, Policy Mates.” the pattern is overwhelming:

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

The editorial says this about Warren and Sanders: “They both would force these companies to get a new federal charter requiring them to consider ‘stakeholders’ rather than shareholders in their business decisions. They both want to reimpose the old Glass-Steagall fence between commercial banking and investment banking. 'The business model of Wall Street is fraud,’ Mr. Sanders likes to say. Ms. Warren also thinks bankers are crooks: 'Wall Street is looting the economy.’ They agree the U.S. Postal Service should become a bank that offers government checking accounts and would compete with private banks.

“On college as an entitlement, the two again see eye to eye. 'It’s time to cancel student debt and make universal free college a reality,’ one says. The other reverses the order: 'We are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free, and cancel all student debt.’ For the record, Ms. Warren’s plan is the first one.”

There are a scattered handful of traditional liberal Democrats in the House and Senate, but none have any chance of ever being a national candidate in the emerging Democratic-Socialist Party.

We are watching a historic moment in which a once-great American political party is transformed into an anti-American engine of radical change. In 2020, every Democratic candidate will be faced with the challenge of defending a national party that is now the Democratic-Socialist Party.

It will be a wrenching, defining moment for the party of Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy if it is conquered by the party of AOC, Sanders and Warren.

We will not waste your time or test your credulity by talking about how unworthy this is of our republic or of the armed forces the two were supposedly meeting to discuss, or any of that “School House Rock” goody-goody stuff. It’s 2019. We get it.



But ask yourselves what comes next.



On the 1,000th day of Trump’s presidency we find a city and a system unraveled. If we take the long view we can observe that this is, in fact, what Americans voted for in 2016. Trump promised to bring combative, disruptive partisan warfare to levels unseen even during recent low points like the Clinton impeachment and the Iraq War.



Trump has delivered on his promise to disrupt, a promise he made to core supporters starting in June 2015. One of the reasons that his devotees are attached to him in a way that sometimes border on the religious is because he has kept faith with these voters every day of his presidency. Trump likes to boast that he is a builder, but his base hired him for a demolition job.



To win the presidency, though, Trump relied on the support of voters who felt differently – a bloc at least as large as his core followership. The mandate from these voters was not to turn Washington into an apocalyptic hellscape of turgid partisanship but rather just not be Hillary Clinton.



We imagine that those voters have watched the events of the past two months in some combination of fascination, shock, amusement and horror. The cause of such consternation is pretty simple: There is very little left in Trump’s administration that reflects the winning coalition of 2016 between Trump’s populist pitchforkers and the center-right Republican establishment.



Think of it this way – Trump succeeded in an audacious hostile takeover of the Republican Party. But after the establishment was defeated, many members of the old firm stayed on in this new joint venture.



Reince Priebus, Nikki Haley, James Mattis, Rex Tillerson, John Kelly, Kirstjen Nielsen, Jeff Sessions, Tom Price, Elaine Chao, Dan Coats, Mick Mulvaney and Mike Pence all hitched up for the new joint venture between Trump Inc. and the GOP.



It’s down to Mulvaney, Chao and Pence, and if we were Mulvaney we wouldn’t worry about renewing our parking pass for next month.



What that means is that Trump is substantially getting the government he wanted and promised, one in which he is unconstrained by convention, tradition or nearly any rules of the road. He envisioned that as president he could operate in the same way he did as the CEO of his family business.



Of course, as it turns out, he cannot. But he has run out of those individuals who, for the first 900-or-so days, managed to make things run in some kind of orderly way.



Consider the twin snares in which Trump now finds himself bound: Impending impeachment and the foreign policy meltdown in Syria. Both are the result of Trump doing things his way rather than the Washington way.



Any chief of staff worth his salt would have dived in front of that phone call to the Ukrainian president like it was a runaway dump truck. Whether you think Trump acted appropriately or not, he conducted himself in such a way that gave his critics all the ammunition that they needed. One day after Robert Mueller’s testimony snuffed out the already dying embers of impeachment talk in Congress, Trump picked up the phone and started a conflagration.



Any national security adviser in any previous administration would have done everything but swat the phone out of the president’s hand if he was telling Turkey’s strongman president that the U.S. would clear the way for Turkish forces to pummel our Kurdish allies.



Again, you may actually agree with the policy of feeding the Kurds to the Turks, but we are left in a situation where the American Air Force is bombing American military installations to keep them out of the hands of rapidly advancing hostile forces. Those are procedural, not policy problems.



The next 12 months will determine what, if any, legacy Trump will leave behind. Trump re-elected, Trump defeated, Trump impeached but preserved by the Senate and Trump impeached and removed are all real possibilities. And no one will have as much to say about which of those eventualities comes to pass as Trump himself.



His team is in disarray and his administration lurches daily from disaster to disaster. If he does not find a way to change that it won’t matter how bad the Democrats’ nominee is, Trump will never see a second term.



Given the fact that today’s White House press conference was to announce Trump’s decision to host world leaders next year at one of his family’s golf resorts, we get the sense that maybe that reality has not yet taken root in the West Wing.



THE RULEBOOK: FOCUS ON THE POSITIVES

TIME OUT: TIMELESS JULIE ANDREWS

Atlantic: “Home Work, [Julie Andrews] second memoir (this one co-published with her eldest daughter, Emma Walton Hamilton), is an account of what happened between Andrews’s film debut in 1964’s Mary Poppins and her performance in the 1982 movie Victor/Victoria. The motivation for the book, Andrews told [The Atlantic], was twofold. After the 2008 publication of her first memoir, Home, which detailed her difficult childhood and her earliest days as a performer, fans and friends had urged her to dive into the next phase. ‘The first one ended as I was heading to Hollywood,’ she said, ‘so of course everybody said, ‘When, when, when are you going to do the next one?’ Because they wanted to hear all that.’ Home, in other words, ended right before the moment when Andrews took the role that would change her life. The book is a dance between candor and diplomacy, as Andrews navigates the imperative of honesty with the courteousness that seems to be her governing instinct.”

OUTPOURING FOR ELIJAH CUMMINGS, LION OF THE HOUSE

Baltimore Sun: “U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Baltimore, a committee chairman known for his devotion to Baltimore and civil rights and for blunt and passionate speechmaking, died of longstanding health problems early Thursday morning, his office said. He was 68 years old. The Democrat, a key figure in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump as chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, died at Gilchrist Hospice Care, a Johns Hopkins affiliate, at approximately 2:45 A.M., a spokeswoman said. Cummings, who had been absent from Capitol Hill in recent weeks while under medical attention, had health issues in recent years. In 2017, he underwent an aortic valve replacement. The procedure, which aides described as minimally invasive in Cummings’ case, is used to correct narrowing of the aortic valve in the heart. The surgery led to an infection that kept him in the hospital longer than expected.”



LATE IN THE RACE, DEM FAULT LINES EMERGE

WaPo: “As the party’s fourth debate concluded, the Democratic primary contest opened a more robust and unpredictable clash over the ideological direction of the party, with moderates attempting to ignite the kind of passion that the liberal candidates have harnessed with large crowds and grass-roots donor networks. After months in which the race was largely static amid a crowded, free-ranging field, the nomination fight is showing signs of narrowing its focus to fewer candidates, divided into parallel feuds in the liberal and moderate wings of the party. [Elizabeth] Warren (Mass.) is entering a crucial phase of her campaign, taking attacks from all sides for the first time since she ascended in popularity, and attempting to demonstrate she can withstand the kind of scrutiny that previously fell mostly on [Joe] Biden, who until recently held an unchallenged lead in the polls. Yet as she attempts to coalesce support on the party’s left flank, Warren faces a renewed challenge from liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)… The left’s feud is replicated in the center, where Biden faces challenges from [Pete] Buttigieg, [Amy] Klobuchar and others.”



Biden dismisses Warren as a fellow front-runner - Fox News: “One day after being overshadowed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren at the Democrats’ latest debate, Joe Biden repeatedly criticized the progressive senator from Massachusetts, whose status has risen in recent months, making her a presidential primary front-runner alongside the former vice president. In Columbus, Ohio, Biden questioned Warren’s honesty and pushed back against the media’s labeling of Warren as a ‘co-front-runner.’ ‘I haven’t seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a front-runner,’ Biden said. ‘You guys keep talking about that.’ Biden did acknowledge, in referencing the latest polls, that ‘Warren has done very well. She’s moved.’”



RNC raises record-setting $27.3 million in September - Fox News: “The Republican National Committee raised a record-setting $27.3 million in September and had $59.2 million cash on hand last month amid the impeachment push against President Trump -- which has fueled GOP campaign contributions heading into the 2020 election. The RNC’s September fundraising haul is the best off-cycle month in the history of both the Republican and Democratic parties. This cycle, to date, the RNC has almost tripled the Democratic National Committee’s fundraising efforts, according to the GOP, which also noted that the Democrats, as of last month, carried $7.3 million in debt. ‘While Democrats focus on fighting President Trump, Republicans have prioritized voters and we have another record-breaking fundraising month—the highest ever off-cycle—to show for it,’ RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told Fox News.”



DEMS FACE TIMING QUESTION WITH IMPEACHMENT

Politico: “Democrats are in an impeachment bind. For the first time, they’re receiving a gusher of evidence to support charges that President Donald Trump abused his power for political and personal gain, pressuring Ukraine’s fledgling government to investigate his political rival Joe Biden. But as more witnesses come forward to spill more secrets, the more Democrats are nervously eyeing the dwindling congressional calendar and wondering: When should we be satisfied with what we have and bring articles of impeachment to the floor? … Some Democrats say the investigation should continue until the evidence is so overwhelming it pries loose a few Republican votes, delivering a symbolic victory as Democrats hold out hope that impeachment isn’t a purely party-line issue. Others believe Democrats should exhaust the list of willing witnesses before drafting formal articles. And still others say the House already has enough evidence to move forward with impeachment immediately — from Trump’s own admission…”



McConnell readies party members for impeachment trial - WaPo: “Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told Republican senators Wednesday to be ready for an impeachment trial of President Trump as soon as Thanksgiving, as the Senate began to brace for a political maelstrom that would engulf the nation. An air of inevitability has taken hold in Congress, with the expectation Trump will become the third president in history to be impeached — and Republicans believe they need to prepare to defend the president. While McConnell briefed senators on what would happen during a Senate trial, House GOP leaders convened what they expect will be regular impeachment strategy sessions. In their closed-door weekly luncheon, McConnell gave a PowerPoint presentation about the impeachment process and fielded questions alongside his staff and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who was a manager for the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton.”



Perry says Trump sent him to Giuliani - Fox News: “Energy Secretary Rick Perry, whose name has been mentioned in connection with President Trump’s Ukraine dealings, said in an interview published late Wednesday that the president told him to seek out Rudy Giuliani earlier this year to look into possible Ukrainian corruption. The Wall Street Journal sat down with Perry for an extensive interview and reported that the spring conversation was a sign of how closely Giuliani — a personal lawyer for Trump — worked on Ukraine policy. Giuliani's business dealings with the country were reportedly looked at by federal investigators. He denied any wrongdoing. ‘Visit with Rudy,’ Perry recalled Trump telling him. He told the paper that Trump was not convinced that Kiev ‘straightened up’ its act. Perry told the paper he never heard Trump or Giuliani talk about an investigation into the Bidens.”



Volker’s testimony revealed more concerns about Giuliani - Axios: “New details from Kurt Volker's closed-door interview indicate Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, was deeply conflicted about whether to take the job because of concerns about Rudy Giuliani's shadow involvement. Why it matters: The testimony by Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, earlier this month may help the president in the sense that it paints Giuliani, not President Trump, as the mastermind behind a campaign to get foreign leaders to investigate the Biden family and Burisma, according to sources with direct knowledge of his testimony. But it also amplifies concerns that Trump was more interested in what his personal lawyer had to say than the professionals in government. Taylor was also worried that Trump might be willing to trade away Ukraine's interests as part of a grand bargain with Russia, Volker told lawmakers. Taylor is expected to appear before members of Congress next week.”



The Judge’s Ruling: It’s impeachable if the House says it is - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains if President Trump right when he says the impeachment inquiry is unfair: “The illegitimacy argument contended that since the House has yet to vote to authorize an investigation of the president, its committees lack subpoena power. This argument contends that since impeachment seeks to overturn a valid election, it is a thinly veiled coup and thus is in violation of the Constitution. And the argument about unfairness states that the president is entitled to due process at every stage of the impeachment proceedings. These are valid political arguments. But as legal offerings, they are profoundly misguided. … Impeachment is always constitutional if it originates in the House and if its basis is arguably for treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” More here.

FLEA MARKET CHEESE? REALLY?

Fresno [Calif.] Bee: “Lemoore [Calif.] police are investigating the theft of $50,000 in cheese in a crime that is believed to reach back to 2017. The investigation, launched in late August, centers around products from Leprino Foods Plant in the 300 block of Belle Haven Drive in the South Valley city. A police spokeswoman said multiple subjects have been linked to the thefts and the cheese has been sold from Fresno to Riverside counties: door-to-door, on the street, at flea markets and on social media sites. After serving warrants, detectives recovered a large amount of cheese and arrested Jairo Mariano Osorio Alvarez, 24, and Roderick Domingo Ransom, 34, both of Lemoore.”

Moody's report, tweeted out on Tuesday, said early signs point to a Trump victory mostly fueled by a strong economy. However, the results will depend on voter turnout.

""Our 2020 Presidential Election Models: Early signs point to Trump, though turnout is key,"" the tweet read.

The report states that Trump has the advantage in several forecast models such as the economy, personal finances, and energy prices.

""The current environment of stable to low gas prices favors Trump in his reelection bid. Moreover, the baseline forecast calls for gasoline prices to dip slightly in the year leading up to the 2020 election,"" the report reads.

THERE'S 'MATERIAL CHANCE' TRUMP WILL BE REMOVED FROM OFFICE, SAYS MSNBC GUEST

""Finances matter here as well, as voters who feel better off from real and not just nominal, wage gains are more likely to express comfort in the status quo. This measure also favors Trump.""

The report also claims Trump would win in a massive landslide if voter sentiment about their pocketbooks was the main factor that drove them to the polls.

""If voters were to vote primarily on the basis of their pocketbooks, the president would steamroll the competition, taking home 351 electoral votes to the Democrats’ 187, assuming average voter turnout,"" the document states. ""This shows the importance that prevailing economic sentiment at the household level could hold in the next election.""

Moody's said Trump's fluctuating approval ratings will not work against him and are comparable to past presidents who have won reelection. They also say a strong stock market will help the president, even if it is not directly tied to economic growth.

SARAH SANDERS: DEMS ON DEBATE STAGE KNEW WARREN IS FRONTRUNNER AND BIDEN IS 'FINISHED'

The caveat comes in the form of voter turnout. The report claims that if turnout among Democrats and independents match their maximum historical highs, Trump would lose in a tight race.

""An average of the three sets of model results suggests that if turnout of nonincumbent voters in 2020 matches the historical high across states, then Democrats would win a squeaker with 279 electoral votes to the president’s 259,"" the report reads.

""Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Minnesota and New Hampshire would all flip from Trump’s column versus our average turnout baseline.""

Moody's stated that the country's continued economic upswing is vital to a Trump victory, but also claimed America is at risk of heading into a financial downturn, as part of an impending global recession, in the next 12-18 months.

“I think risks are awfully high that if something doesn’t stick to script then we do have a recession,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics. “I’ll say this also: Even if we don’t have a recession over the next 12-18 months, I think it’s pretty clear that we’re going to have a much weaker economy.”

Moody's said they have corrected their turnout models from 2016, which caused the forecast to incorrectly predict a victory by Hillary Clinton."

""This is a newly prosperous Middle America and it is Middle America that decides elections."" — Stuart Varney, Fox Business host

""This is a newly prosperous Middle America and it is Middle America that decides elections,"" said Varney on his Fox Nation show ""My Take.""

According to a study by Sentier Research, the country's middle class has seen a $5,000 annual increase in income under the Trump administration, totaling the median household income to approximately $66,000.

""Trump up $5,000 in three years; Bush, Obama up $1,500 in 16 years,"" observed Varney.

Varney believes the latest report will not play well for 2020 progressive candidates, who are ""unable to acknowledge Trump's success.""

""The socialists running for the presidency repeat their tired old cliches about 'the rich getting richer and you gotta work two or three jobs to make ends meet'...they can't say that tax cuts, deregulations, and cheap energy haven't brought prosperity... they can't say it,"" said Varney.

VARNEY: SANDERS' HOSPITALIZATION MAY TIP NOMINATION TO WARREN

""To acknowledge that means to acknowledge the success of Trump's policies and that's something no Democrat can do,"" Varney continued.

""It's the Democrats' dilemma,"" he added. ""How do you run against prosperity?""

Varney questioned whether the Democrats' ""current tactics"" are enough to ""beat the extra money in America's pocket.""

""You call the president names, you try to impeach him, you stomp your feet and you say, 'Oh, I just can't stand him,'"" said Varney, ""but does all of that beat extra money in Middle America's pocket? And will Middle America take a leap in the dark for socialism?"" he asked.

""It's hard to imagine that we will abandon the system that's made this country wealthy just because of the president's style and tone,"" Varney continued.

VARNEY ON TRUMP RALLY PROTESTS: THIS IS THE U.S., WE DON'T SURRENDER TO INTIMIDATION

""It's awfully hard to run against prosperity."" — Stuart Varney, Fox Business host

Citing Moelis & Company, a prominent investment bank with a solid record of predicting presidential wins, Varney said he believes Trump will win reelection if the economy remains on an upward trajectory.

VARNEY: ATHLETES SHOW 'GLARING DOUBLE STANDARD AS THEY SLAM TRUMP'

""President Trump will easily win reelection if the economy holds up,"" Varney said, ""that's from Moelis... they've been right about every president since 1980... they are saying prosperity wins and unless something goes badly wrong, we will remain a prosperous nation in November of next year.""

""Yes,"" Varney reiterated, ""it's awfully hard to run against prosperity.""

One day after reports emerged that the group of far-left House Democrats planned to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders in the 2020 presidential race, it seemed only one of them – Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. – was officially aboard the Bernie Bus:

As for the others:

-- Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had made no official endorsement but was still rumored to be attending a Sanders rally scheduled for this weekend in Queens, N.Y. – one of two New York city boroughs that include a portion of Ocasio-Cortez’s home district.

BIDEN DISMISSIVE OF OCASIO-CORTEZ'S EXPECTED ENDORSEMENT OF BERNIE SANDERS

-- Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., clarified Wednesday that she had not yet endorsed a 2020 presidential candidate – even though CNN and Omar claimed Tlaib had backed Sanders.

-- Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., also hadn’t made an endorsement.

Pressley’s camp stressed that while the Squad members support one another in Congress, they don’t necessarily speak with one voice on all issues.

“Ayanna has tremendous respect for her sisters-in-service,” a Pressley spokesperson told Vox. “Ultimately, these political decisions are made as individuals.”

“Ayanna has tremendous respect for her sisters-in-service. Ultimately, these political decisions are made as individuals.” — Spokeswoman for U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.

One factor possibly stalling a Pressley endorsement of Sanders: She hails from the same state as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, so she might not be as eager to oppose a presidential candidate from her home area – the way that Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., for example, backed former Vice President Joe Biden instead of her fellow Californian, Sen. Kamala Harris.

According to Boston.com, Pressley’s ties to the Sanders campaign aren’t as strong as those of Ocasio-Cortez and Omar, with Pressley having backed Hillary Clinton over Sanders in 2016. In addition, Pressley has worked with Warren on legislation in Congress and also has close relationships with Harris and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who have been seeking her endorsement, the report said.

Tlaib, meanwhile, hasn’t ruled out a Sanders endorsement down the road, telling the Detroit Free Press she will host the U.S. senator from Vermont in her district later this month – just as she recently did recently with Warren. (Warren posted video from that visit online Wednesday -- and Tlaib retweeted it.)

""I am looking forward to bringing Senator Sanders to Michigan on Oct. 27 for a tour of our district that will highlight economic justice issues and corporate tax giveaways, and (include) a roundtable with housing justice advocates,” Tlaib said. “I need to know that anyone I choose to endorse will fight for my residents, and I appreciate the opportunity for them to have a dialogue with Sen. Sanders about these critically important issues.”

But regardless of what Tlaib and Pressley ultimately decide to do, the Sanders endorsement by Omar – and rumored endorsement by Ocasio-Cortez – were blows to the Warren campaign, coming on the same night that the senator fended off fierce attacks from fellow Democrats at the party’s presidential debate in Ohio.

As Boston.com noted, Warren has courted Ocasio-Cortez, having lunch with her in March, writing a blurb for Ocasio-Cortez’s entry in Time magazine’s “Time 100” listing, and filming a video with Ocasio-Cortez in which the pair reviewed the final episode of “Game of Thrones.”"

""I suggest that Bernie Sanders take a week and go to Venezuela without bodyguards, and go onto the street and [use his] cell phone to [see] what's going on,"" Guerra said.

BERNIE SANDERS REFUSES TO CALL VENEZUELA'S MADURO 'DICTATOR,' SAYS 'DEMOCRATIC OPERATIONS TAKING PLACE'

In February, Sanders refused to label the country's socialist leader Nicolás Maduro a dictator and said Democratic operations still existed in the war-torn nation, despite crippling inflation and a starving populace.

“Why have you stopped short of calling Maduro of Venezuela a dictator?” CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked Sanders.

“I think it’s fair to say that the last election was undemocratic, but there are still democratic operations taking place in that country. The point is, what I’m calling for right now is internationally supervised fair elections,” he replied.

Bernie Sanders of Vermont took aim Thursday at presidential nomination rival Joe Biden, accusing the former vice president of using insurance industry “talking points” to criticize Sanders' plan to implement a government-run “Medicare-for-all” system.

“It is really sad that Joe Biden is using the talking points of the insurance industry to attack Medicare for All,” Sanders claimed in an email to supporters.

“Joe must know that we currently spend twice as much per capita on health care as the people of almost any other major country and that we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,” added the independent senator who’s making his second straight White House bid.

POLL: VOTERS OPPOSE 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' SYSTEM THAT ELIMINATES PRIVATE INSURANCE

Biden has opposed the “Medicare-for-all” plan championed by Sanders and supported by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts – a co-front-runner with Biden right now in the Democrats' primary race. The Senate bill – which Sanders authored – would eliminate private insurance. Biden, instead, has been pushing for a public option to strengthen and supplement the national health-care law better known as ObamaCare.

At Tuesday’s fourth-round presidential primary debate, Biden once again criticized “Medicare-for-all,” taking aim at its price tag.

“The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget,” he emphasized.

He also argued that the costs would be passed on to average Americans.

“If a fireman and a schoolteacher are making $100,000 a year, their taxes are going to go up about $10,000,” Biden noted. “That is more than they will possibly save on this health-care plan.”

BIDEN TAKES AIM AT SANDERS AND WARREN OVER 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

Responding, Sanders indirectly accused Biden of failing to stand up to the health-care industry.

“I will tell you what the issue is here. The issue is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the health-care industry, which made $100 billion in profit, whether we have the guts to stand up to the corrupt, price-fixing pharmaceutical industry, which is charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,” he stressed.

BUTTIGIEG, KLOBUCHAR, SLAM WARREN OVER 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

“If we don't have the guts to do that, if all we can do is take their money, we should be ashamed of ourselves,” Sanders added.

Speaking to reporters Wednesday in Ohio, Biden returned fire, saying, “Bernie doesn’t pay for half his plan.”

And, taking aim at both Sanders and Warren – who unlike Sanders has refused to acknowledge that middle-class taxes would rise to pay for “Medicare-for-all” – Biden said, “look, the last thing the Democrats should be doing is playing (President) Trump’s game and trying to con the American people to think this is easy. There’s nothing easy about it.”

The intra-party battle over implementing “Medicare-for-all” versus strengthening the nation’s health-care law – known as the Affordable Care Act – has been a leading and divisive issue in the race for the presidential nomination."

Appearing on a panel with Trump campaign senior adviser Mercedes Schlapp and former Bill Clinton adviser Doug Schoen, Ingraham said Ocasio-Cortez and her ""Squad"" are warriors for their own cause: socialism.

After the fourth Democratic primary debate on Tuesday, three of the ""Squad"" members signaled that they would endorse Senator Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for president in 2020.

'SQUAD' MEMBERS NOT 'ALL IN' ON ENDORSEMENT OF BERNIE SANDERS

""Sanders calls himself a socialist and they -- the Squad and AOC --want primacy and power in the party,"" Schoen explained. ""If they went with Warren they'd be in also...she calls herself a capitalist, albeit, one with socialist principles. It's to maintain power and influence in the Democratic party that increasingly looks to AOC and the Squad for leadership.""

""I keep thinking it's really about a future presidential run for AOC,"" Ingraham added, explaining that Ocasio-Cortez can someday bring in Sanders supporters for her own run.

""This is about list-building. This is about excitement and Bernie still had the excitement. I didn't see a great groundswell of excitement, or hear it even, in that room for [Elizabeth] Warren,"" she noted, referring to the debate.

""You know what it is?"" asked Schoen, ""She's the best of a very bad bunch to the Democrats because you're right she doesn't offer much.

""But AOC, Laura, I've looked at the polling,"" he said. ""She was among the most popular Democrats in the country, including the congressional leadership and the 14-odd candidates.""

Bernie Sanders I-Vt., seemed to embrace socialism, even as he attempted to distance himself from his rival, Sen. Elizabeth Warren D-Mass., dismissing her as a “capitalist.”

""The seeds of socialism have already been planted and, if we don’t rip [them] out at the roots, we and future generations are gonna wake up to a living nightmare."" — Tomi Lahren, Fox Nation host

""Bernie Sanders dispelled the notion that he and Elizabeth Warren are basically the same person -- even seemingly taking a bit of offense to being compared to Warren,"" Lahren said on Fox Nation's ""Final Thoughts.""

""Not because she lied about being a Native American, not because she may have lied about being fired for being pregnant, but because she is a capitalist,"" she continued.

TOMI LAHREN ISN'T SHOCKED BY 'SQUAD'S ENDORSEMENT

“There are differences between Elizabeth and myself,” Sanders said during an interview Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" “Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.”

Sanders explained he is not a capitalist because he ""will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary.”

Instead, Sanders is trying to run on a ""Democratic"" brand of socialism, which Lahren called ""a lie and an oxymoron.""

""You can’t have freedom -- economic or otherwise -- under socialism. He and others simply slap that 'democratic' before 'socialism' to make their warped desires of government-controlled everything seem more palatable,"" Lahren said. ""Sad thing is, it’s working -- especially on young Americans.""

SANDERS PROMISES NEW JOBS FOR 'TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS' DURING DEMOCRATIC DEBATE

The comments come amid a rise in socialism in the Democratic Party, as candidates become more willing to openly embrace socialism over capitalism. It also follows polling showing that Democrats now view socialism more positively than they do capitalism.

A Gallup poll this year found 43 percent of Americans think socialism would be a good thing for the United States, compared to a 1942 Roper/Fortune survey that found 40 percent of Americans described socialism as a bad thing.

""This just goes to show how dangerously close we are to becoming a socialist nation,"" said Lahren, commenting on the poll. ""The seeds of socialism have already been planted and, if we don’t rip those suckers out at the roots, we and future generations are gonna wake up to a living nightmare,"" she warned.

Lahren blamed the ""shocking and downright frightening"" shift on a misrepresentation of socialism and warned of potential ramifications.

""What is happening here?"" she asked. ""Well, leaders like Bernie... Warren, and others are not being honest about what socialism actually entails. They characterize it as a method of rooting out corruption, sticking it to the 'man,' and fighting for the little guy when, in fact, nothing could be further from the truth.""

""Socialism breeds corruption,"" she continued. ""There is no bigger 'man' than the 'Almighty Government' and the little guy is the one who is absolutely crushed by socialism.""

Doubling down in her criticism of the Vermont senator and his socialist policies, Lahren warned ""young people of the country"" not to fall for ""free things that will cost them their freedom.""

BILLIONAIRES COULD FACE UP TO 97.5 PERCENT TAX RATES UNDER SANDERS’ PLAN: ECONOMISTS

""I know free things might sound great to you now,"" she said, ""but here’s the cold, hard truth -- those free things come at a cost of your freedom. Don’t like being told what to do? Wait till you live under socialism. It won’t be pretty. You can be free or you can be dependent on the government -- but you can't be both. Choose wisely,"" she said.

""This next election and, even more importantly, the one after that, will determine the future of this nation,"" Lahren concluded. ""Don’t take it lightly.""

He's winding down foreign entanglements, long term military interventions that I seem to recall Democrats used to be against.""

ON SYRIA, TRUMP ACCUSES GRAHAM OF WANTING 'TO STAY IN THE MIDDLE EAST FOR THE NEXT THOUSAND YEARS'

Ingraham criticized Democrats for not supporting Trump even though Obama made the same points regarding foreign conflicts during his presidency. She also accused the Democratic presidential candidates of opposing the president for the sake of opposing him.

""By the end of the evening it was obvious that the Democrats will say and do at this point almost anything, including contort their own views on key issues just to oppose Trump,"" Ingraham said, referencing the debate Tuesday night.

For the better part of the year, former Vice President Joe Biden dominated the polls and the other candidates in the race attacked him from the left, which is weird to see.

Biden still believed in law enforcement and international borders, and he opposed forced bussing, along with virtually every other American. So he was obviously one of those right-wing extremists from the Obama administration.

That's what they were telling you on the debate stage. It was bizarre.

BIDEN RAMPS UP ATTACKS ON WARREN, DISMISSES HER AS A FELLOW FRONT-RUNNER

Thankfully, that line of attack is over because Joe Biden's presidential campaign itself is in effect over. Nobody thinks Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee. Elizabeth Warren is the front-runner now. That's not contested. The race is now hers to lose.

So during Tuesday night's debate, her rivals on the stage decide to help her do just that -- lose.

Pete Buttigieg, South Bend, Ind. mayor: Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything ... except this.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.: At least Bernie is being honest here in saying how he is going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

Joe Biden: I'm going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I'm the only one in this stage that has gotten anything really big done.

Klobuchar: And I appreciate Elizabeth's work. But again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done.

Biden: I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it.

Klobuchar: I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

Beto O'Rourke: Sometimes, I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

If Elizabeth Warren can't even explain her own signature plan to rearrange the entire American health care system, she can't win.

She is punitive? When Beto O'Rourke, Mr. Armed Federal Agents Coming to Your House, calls you out for divisive attacks, it's time to pay attention. And in fact, he does make a fair point.

The main reason Warren has surpassed Bernie Sanders in the hearts of primary voters despite pretty close economic programs is that she is the one far more willing to descend into the filth of identity politics.

Bernie is an ideologue. There are some things that he just won't say. Elizabeth Warren will say anything.

Recently, she tweeted this: ""Every person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. And that starts with using correct pronouns. I'm Elizabeth. My pronouns are she/her/hers.""

In case you were wondering -- in case there was any question at all -- that kind of posturing is central to Elizabeth Warren's campaign. She is happy to tell you, and often does, that you're worth less, or you're worth more, based on how you were born.

Unfortunately, that works right now in the Democratic Party.

One thing Elizabeth Warren is not willing to say, however, is how much her single-payer government health care plan will cost -- trillions of dollars, obviously. Nobody disputes that. Nobody disputes that.

And in fact, as a mathematical matter, there's no way to raise that kind of money without hiking taxes on the middle class. It's simple arithmetic. And yet for some reason, Warren refuses to admit that.

Marc Lacey, national editor for the New York Times: You have not specified how you're going to pay for the most expensive plan ""Medicare-for-All."" Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it? Yes or no?

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.: So I have made clear but my principles are here and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down.

Lacey: Mayor Buttigieg, you say Senator Warren has been ""evasive"" about how she is going to pay for ""Medicare-for-All."" What's your response?

Buttigieg: Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer.

Save that tape.

There are a lot of moments in debates that seem like a huge deal at the time. Everyone is yapping about them. But in the end, it turned out to be completely meaningless. This is not one of those moments.

Health care is always at the top of voters' concerns and so are taxes for that matter. If Elizabeth Warren can't even explain her own signature plan to rearrange the entire American health care system, she can't win.

Even a post-debate MSNBC panel acknowledged as much.

Claire McCaskill, former U.S. senator: I thought she seemed a little petulant at times when she was being challenged.

Eugene Robinson, Washington Post columnist: You think, a little?

McCaskill: A little.

Robinson: As Bernie Sanders says she just won't go there, and she was pummeled for it.

Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for MoveOn.org: They attacked her and she was uncomfortable. She did not handle it very well.

So was it really that bad for Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday night? We'll see.

She definitely got better treatment than Joe Biden got. Journalists don't like Joe Biden. Biden has zero allies in America's ""woke"" newsrooms. Warren, by contrast, has plenty of allies pretending to be journalists.

For example, on Wednesday morning, NYU ""journalism"" professor Jay Rosen -- the guy whose name often pops up, despite no talent whatsoever -- demanded that reporters stop asking specific questions about Warren's policies.

Again, a journalism professor telling you not to ask questions. Rosen tweeted: ""The 'make Elizabeth warren say she would raise taxes on the middle class' question should be a credibility killer. For the journalists who keep asking it.""

Now amazingly, Margaret Sullivan of the Washington Post agreed with that. She wrote this: ""Journalists are kindly doing President Trump's work for him when they insist on trying to pin down Senator Elizabeth Warren to declare she would raise taxes to fund Medicare-for-All. Of course, it's legitimate to dig into the costs, but not in a way that creates a nice GOP campaign ad.""

Did you listen to that? Two journalists telling you, if the answer hurts Democrats, don't ask the question. Don't tell your readers or viewers what the truth is if it increases the chances that Donald Trump could get reelected.

Is that journalism? No, it's pure propaganda. It is the definition of propaganda. Jay Rosen, journalism professor, telling journalists not to ask questions.

Unbelievable.

“I think the Biden campaign needs to be concerned,” the former interim DNC chairwoman told “America’s Newsroom.”

Biden was overshadowed by fellow co-front-runner Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at the fourth-round Democratic presidential nomination debate, but the former vice president has a potentially larger headache – a lack of campaign cash.

AMID BIDEN’S CASH WOES, CAMPAIGN VOWS IT HAS THE MONEY ‘TO RUN OUR RACE’

As Biden was on the debate stage Tuesday night, his third quarter of fundraising filing to the Federal Election Commission was making headlines.

According to the report, Biden had just under $9 million in his campaign coffers after spending more money than he raised during the July-September fundraising quarter. That’s far less than Warren, who reported $25.7 million cash on hand, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, another top tier rival who reported having $33.7 million in the bank.

Democratic operative Michael Ceraso described the new Biden cash on hand figure as troubling.

BIDEN'S THIRD QUARTER FUNDRAISING HAUL A WARNING SIGN

Ceraso, who worked on Sanders’ 2016 campaign and who parted ways this summer with the Buttigieg campaign, warned that Biden needs to remain in the top tier conversation or “his cash flow may dry up as the primary enters the homestretch, which may prevent the VP from competing and challenging his opponents in Super Tuesday states and beyond.”

Biden is spending money at a greater rate than the amount he raised left him, with a burn rate of 112 percent. Warren’s burn rate - the pace at which candidates are spending their campaign cash – was a much more modest 76 percent.

“Get the burn rate down,” Brazile said, calling on Democratic voters to ""step up"" to counter the RNC, which raised a record $27.3 million last month.

In Columbus, Ohio, Biden questioned Warren’s honesty and pushed back against the media’s labeling of Warren as a ""co-front-runner.""

“I haven’t seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a front-runner,” Biden said. “You guys keep talking about that.”

JOE BIDEN'S POTENTIALLY TROUBLING CAMPAIGN CASH REPORT

Biden did acknowledge, in referencing the latest polls, that “Warren has done very well. She’s moved.”

The former vice president was the unrivaled leader of the pack in the 2020 nomination race even before he declared his candidacy in late April. But Warren, gaining stature in a field that once had some two dozen presidential hopefuls, has surged; in many of the most recent national, early-primary-state and caucus-state surveys, she’s virtually tied Biden for the top spot.

Warren’s new status was clearly on display at Tuesday night’s fourth-round nomination debate, when she came under attack from many of her rivals on the stage. Biden, who was the recipient of most of the incoming fire during the first three rounds of debates, was at times absent from the action.

RIVALS TAKE ON WARREN OVER MEDICARE-FOR-ALL, MORE, AT DEBATE

Still, Biden downplayed suggestions that he’s been eclipsed by Warren, saying on the day after the debate that “it's kind of about time other people get questioned.”

But Warren's chief campaign strategist, Joe Rospars, pointing to the attention Warren received at the debate and to new fundraising reports that potentially hint at some trouble for Biden – tweeted on Wednesday that “it’s rare that we get as much real information in one day to clarify the state of the Democratic primary as we did yesterday.”

Near the top of Tuesday’s debate, two primary rivals -- South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota -- forcefully took aim at Warren for not directly answering if she’d raise taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for her push to implement a government-run “Medicare-for-all” health care system.

On that score, Biden had this to say on Wednesday: “It’s fascinating that the person who has a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential thing in this election in the minds of the American people, across the board. And you know, credibility matters. It matters.”

""She’s going to have to tell the truth, or a question will be raised about whether she’s going to be candid and honest with the American people,” Biden said. “I don’t want to pick on Elizabeth Warren, but this is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.”

Biden, who opposes the Medicare-for-all plan long championed by more progressive rivals like Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont instead supports strengthening the Affordable Care Act with a public option.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

“The last thing the Democrats should be doing is playing (President) Trump’s game and trying to con the American people to think this is easy,""Biden said. “There’s nothing easy about it. If you’re going to do it, tell us how you’re going to do it. It’s called truth in speaking.”

Warren’s campaign told Fox News that the senator is “reviewing the revenue options suggested by the 2016 Bernie [Sanders] campaign along with other revenue options.”

Warren further emphasized at the debate that “I will not sign a bill into law that does not cut costs for middle-class families.”

Beyond health care, Biden criticized Warren for saying during the debate that “I think that we [the United States] ought to get out of the Middle East.”

Warren – who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee – appeared to suggest an end to the decades-old U.S. military presence in the volatile Mideast. Her comments came during a discussion of President Trump’s heavily criticized move to pull U.S. troops out of northeastern Syria.

While Warren has long called for reducing America’s military presence overseas, her campaign said after the debate that the candidate was talking only about combat troops.

“Senator Warren was referencing combat troops, not those stationed in the Middle East in non-combat roles. She believes we need to end the endless wars. That means working to responsibly remove U.S. troops from combat in the Middle East, and using diplomacy to work with allies and partners to end conflicts and suffering in the region,” the campaign said in a statement.

Biden, on Wednesday, said he “frankly was surprised” by Warren’s comments.

The former vice president – who repeatedly touts his foreign policy chops – added that “I had never heard any say, with any serious background on foreign policy, that we pull all troops out of the Middle East. … I’m not sure exactly what she meant by it.”

“If she meant pulling our fleet out of the eastern Mediterranean or the Persian Gulf, I think it would be an absolute disaster for American security and American foreign policy.”

Biden repeated his criticism – without naming Warren – later Wednesday when he delivered a foreign policy address in Iowa.

The network landed an average of 8.3 million views during the three-hour telecast. That marked quite a dip from its previous two-part debates in July, where viewership peaked at 10.7 million. CNN's debate also saw an almost 50-percent drop from the first debate hosted by NBC News back in June, which received 15.3 million viewers.

In addition, 449,000 viewers watched live streams on various platforms from CNN and The New York Times, who co-hosted the debate.

The fourth debate featured 12 candidates on one stage. They were: former Vice President Joe Biden,; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Sen. Kamala Harris of California; tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas; Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; and billionaire donor Tom Steyer.

CNN DEBATE SLAMMED BY CRITICS, CANDIDATES: 'DAMAGED THE NETWORK'S CREDIBILITY EVEN FURTHER'

CNN and The Times faced an avalanche of criticism during and after the debate. The hosting news outlets received backlash for not asking the 12 candidates about topics including China, which has made big headlines in recent weeks amid the ongoing trade war with the U.S.; the mounting tensions in Hong Kong; and the growing controversy with the NBA.

Even the candidates slammed the debate hosts. Castro blasted the debate for not asking any questions about climate change but making time for a question about Ellen DeGeneres' friendship with former President George W. Bush. Harris similarly called out the news organizations for overlooking climate change, immigration and LGBT issues.

Gabbard, however, may have had the fiercest attack, which she made on the debate stage.

""The New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime-change war,"" she said, apparently gesturing toward the moderators. ""Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia -- completely despicable.""

""Their proposals are crazy,"" she said, saying some could cost into the trillions of dollars.

""Who do they think is actually going to pay for these? It's going to be two of the three Americans that aren't going to college paying for the one out of three that do,"" DeVos said. ""Let's look at this for what it really is: A federal takeover of higher education.""

2020 DEMS MAKING BIG, COSTLY PROMISES ON STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS

On the Democratic primary ballot, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., released a plan in June that calls for all student debt to be eliminated regardless of family income level, and that students from families with incomes of $25,000 or less would have their college costs covered.

The plan would be paid for with a tax on stock trades, bonds, derivatives and other types of investments. The Vermont lawmaker called the plan ""a revolutionary proposal.""

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said she plans to cancel $50,000 in student debt for each person with household incomes under $100,000.

DeVos said American education scores are nowhere near those of other nations.

""Two out of three eighth-graders can't read or write at their grade level,"" she said.

DeVos also rejected a claim by Randi Weingarten of the American Federation of Teachers, who claimed President Trump is not properly supporting the public education system.

""The Trump administration is not doing anything on public education,"" Weingarten said. ""We have to make sure [public schools] are well-funded and we have to make sure that they have the resources they need so that every child has a shot in public school.""

Williamson said ""everyone had a bad night"" at Tuesday's fourth Democratic presidential debate and that the candidates' lackluster performances are why she isn't dropping out of the race.

In an op-ed she wrote for The Washington Post on Wednesday, Williamson -- who failed to meet the criteria to take part in the fourth-round debate -- criticized the Democratic National Committee, saying political insiders are parading around a ""repackaged"" nominating process that she called a ""faux democracy.""

On Thursday, Williamson cited America's first president, George Washington.

""He said we'd be more concerned with their faction than with their country"" and added that she feels ""strongly about the power of the individual citizen,"" Williamson told MacCallum. ""That's the decider in all this.""

Amy Klobuchar – giddy after a lack of sleep and rave reviews for her debate performance – touted to the jam-packed crowd inside a café in New Hampshire’s capital city that she raised $1.1 million in the 24 hours after Tuesday’s Democratic presidential nomination showdown.

The haul was nearly a quarter of what she brought in during the entire July-September third quarter of fundraising.

BUTTIGIEG, KLOUCHAR SLAM WARREN FOR NOT SAYING HOW SHE'LL PAY FOR MEDICARE-FOR-ALL

Highlighting that most of the money was from small-dollar contributions, the Minnesota Democrat told reporters “that shows something happened, that people were watching and they responded. And that is a very big deal for us.”

As Klobuchar spotlighted her post-debate haul, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who also excelled during the showdown, reported bringing in $1.1 million in the same 24-hours following the debate.

His campaign touted that Wednesday was “one of our biggest fundraising days yet.” And Buttigieg communications director Lis Smith showcased that the campaign “saw more traffic to their website in the past 24 hours than any other day.”

At the debate, both Buttigieg and Klobuchar took aim at co-front runner Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts over how she’d pay for her proposed government-run Medicare-for-all plan.

The aggressive moves throughout the debate by both Buttigieg and Klobuchar literally paid off. And the potential surge for the two candidates trying to appeal to more centrist voters in the party could spell trouble for another more establishment contender: former Vice President Joe Biden.

AMID BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN CASH WOES, TOP ADVISERS VOW THEY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY

Biden was the unrivaled front-runner in the race from even before he declared his candidacy in late April. But Warren caught up with him this autumn in many of the most recent national and early voting state polls. And Biden’s been eclipsed by Warren, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Buttigieg when it comes to the crucial fundraising race.

According to his Federal Election Commission filing, Biden had just under $9 million in his campaign coffers after spending more money than he raised the past three months. That’s far less than Sanders, Warren, and even Buttigieg.

“This week's debate was the best yet for Mayor Pete and Sen. Klobuchar and came at a moment of prime opportunity for them,” noted Ben LaBolt, a Democratic strategist who served as a spokesman on Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign and national press secretary on the president’s 2012 re-election campaign.

LaBolt spotlighted that “Biden's vote share is more gettable for pragmatic candidates like Buttigieg and Klobuchar than it is for Warren. The challenge now is to present a vision that shows what they could achieve in office versus a more systemically disruptive vision from Sen. Warren. The clock is ticking in Iowa and New Hampshire for that message to reach the remaining persuadable voters.”

Klobuchar, on frenetic post-debate swing through all 10 counties in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state, appears to get it.

She called her performance in this week’s debate “critical.” And with just three and a half months to go until the primaries and caucuses kick off, she emphasized “this is when the campaign season begins.”"

California Democrats Rep. Maxine Waters and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, for example, have been vocal opponents of Trump's troop withdrawal, after supporting Obama's efforts almost exactly eight years later.

ERDOGAN THREW TRUMP'S 'DON'T BE A FOOL' LETTER IN THE TRASH, SOURCES CLAIM

“As the war in Iraq draws to a close, it is my hope that this conflict will serve as a solemn reminder of the costs of war,” Waters said in a statement issued Oct. 21, 2011. “We must carefully reexamine our approach to national security and how we view the United States' role in promoting international peace and security. If we are to remain leaders in the world, we must always use our best judgment to determine when and how we engage other nations and other actors – particularly if we are considering the use of military force.”

Waters’ approach to the United States’ role in world affairs is similar to Trump’s recent warnings against “fighting other people’s wars.”

Cut to Oct. 7, 2019, and Waters blasted Trump for leaving Kurdish forces to fend for themselves against Turkish attacks.

“If the United States abandons the Kurds, these courageous allies will never trust us again,” Waters said in a statement, adding that “Trump’s betrayal of the Kurds is a gift to Russia, Iran and ISIS.”

That same day, Pelosi came out against Trump, warning that leaving northern Syria could lead to an ISIS resurgence.

DEMS STORM OUT OF SYRIA MEETING WITH TRUMP: 'WE HAVE TO PRAY FOR HIS HEALTH'

“This reckless, misguided decision undermines the efforts by our brave servicemembers and our allies to end ISIS’s tyranny,” she said.

But while Republicans had similar concerns about withdrawing from Iraq in 2011, Pelosi praised Obama “for a promise made and a promise kept, honoring the U.S.-Iraq Security Agreement and the wishes of the American people to bring all our troops home by the end this year.”

Pelosi stormed out of a meeting with Trump Wednesday after what she said was a ""meltdown"" by the president.

One of the Democratic frontrunners for the 2020 presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was also critical of Trump, despite being historically anti-war.

“You don’t turn your back on an ally that lost 11,000 troops fighting against terrorism through a tweet and a discussion with Erdogan,” Sanders told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. This criticism came despite Sanders acknowledgment that “I am a strong opponent of endless wars.”

That position was made evident in 2011 when Sanders backed Obama’s Iraq withdrawal.

“I applaud the president's decision and have been advocating that position for quite a while,” adding, “Now is the time to bring our troops home, lower our military budget, and use those funds to create jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure and lowering our national debt.""

On Thursday, Trump vented about Democratic criticism. ""I am the only person who can fight for the safety of our troops & bring them home from the ridiculous & costly Endless Wars, and be scorned. Democrats always liked that position, until I took it,"" he said.

Republicans have been equally critical of Trump, with 129 GOP members voting for a resolution in opposition to the withdrawal, joining a unanimous Democratic contingent. Sen. Lindsey Graham has been particularly vocal, leading Trump to accuse the senator of wanting to “stay in the Middle East for the next 1,000 years.”

Graham, however, was no supporter of Obama, and lumped Trump and his predecessor together in making what he believes to be critical foreign policy errors.

“President Trump is being told EXACTLY what President Obama was told before he withdrew from Iraq,” Graham tweeted Wednesday. “He appears to be hell-bent on making the same mistakes in Syria as President Obama made in Iraq.”"

Instead, these candidates are pledging to remake America entirely. Rip out the old, which is. they're telling us, irredeemably tainted by racism, sexism and free enterprise, and replace it with something completely new and different.

At the heart of this effort is the promise of ""Medicare-for-all."" Now, you may have heard the phrase. Two of the most popular Democratic candidates, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both have endorsed it. But what exactly does it mean? What exactly is ""Medicare-for-all""?

SANDERS ACCUSES BIDEN OF PUSHING INSURANCE INDUSTRY 'TALKING POINTS' BY SLAMMING 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

It's worth finding out. It's not a tweak to some regulation. It's not even ObamaCare, which once upon a time Democrats defended and Republicans denounced as socialism.

""Medicare-for-all"" is actual socialism, for-real socialism. Health care spending amounts to about a fifth of the entire American economy. Elizabeth Warren demands total control of all of it -- immediately. That's ""Medicare-for-all."" If it becomes law, it would amount to the largest expansion of the federal government since the second World War -- by far.

So it's worth asking how exactly all of this would work and critically, who would pay for it. Elizabeth Warren has been asked that question many times, and every time, she has refused to answer.

Marc Lacey, national editor for The New York Times: Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it? Yes or no?

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.: The costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down. Hard-working, middle-class families are going to see their costs go down.

Stephen Colbert, host of ""The Late Show"": But will their taxes go up?

Chris Matthews, host of ""Hardball"": No, no. Different question. How much of your taxes go up?

Warren: No, it's how much your cost --

Matthews: How is it a different question?

Warren: It is how much families end up spending.

Matthews: I know that argument, but will you pay more in taxes? Why don't you want to answer that question because as Jake said tonight, that's a Republican talking point. It's not a Republican talking point. It's a question.

Warren: It's a question about where people are going to come out economically.

Matthews: That's not my question.

Warren: I spent --

She will not answer. She won't explain, no matter how hard she has been pressed. And as you just saw, even some fairly strident Democratic partisans have pressed her.

Warren refuses. She will not explain what it would cost or who would pay for it.

Details, like what things cost or whether something is constitutional, or even if the majority of Americans want it, none of that seems to interest Elizabeth Warren anymore.

Well, now we have a credible estimate. According to a study by the Urban Institute, in just the first 10 years, Elizabeth Warren's ""Medicare-for-all"" plan would cost an additional $34 trillion.

That sounds like a lot. How much is it? Here's some perspective.

The Congressional Budget Office anticipates that the United States -- the whole United States -- will collect just $46 trillion in taxes over the same period. In other words, Elizabeth Warren's health care plan alone will consume the overwhelming majority of all tax dollars in the United States.

That's before we spend a single dollar on -- I don't know -- Social Security, education, national defense and everything else.

It's demented.

Now, you should know that the Urban Institute has no motive to attack Elizabeth Warren. It's not a right-wing think tank. It's a left-wing think tank. They likely didn't even account for the cost of one's pledge to give free health care to every illegal alien who sneaks into the country.

So who is going to pay for all of this? Well, think of it this way: $3.4 trillion a year -- that's the estimated cost. Divide that by 320 million Americans, and you get more than $10,000 per person -- not per taxpayer, per person. That means every child, every retiree, every prison inmate, everybody.

That would be the largest tax assessed in American history by far. Nothing even comes close. That would change everything. An awful lot of people would just leave the country and not come back.

So how do you pay for ""Medicare-for-all""? It's not a minor detail we can settle later. It's the single most important question about the program. Why do you think we don't have it already? Because we can't afford it.

Elizabeth Warren pretends that's irrelevant -- and to her, maybe it is irrelevant.

At some point in the last couple of years, Warren stopped functioning as a conventional senator and became a kind of Messianic figure. Details, like what things cost or whether something is constitutional or even if the majority of Americans want it, none of that seems to interest Elizabeth Warren any more.

Warren has seen the future, and in that future, she has complete and unquestioned control of America. She is the most powerful person in the world.

You can almost hear her repeating the phrase to herself... ""The most powerful person in the world.""

It's intoxicating, clearly.

BIDEN DEFLECTS QUESTIONS ON SON AS CNN ANCHOR HITS TRUMP'S 'FALSE ACCUSATIONS'

What’s more, the candidates challenging Warren are also-rans, mired in the single digits. So that lessens the impact of those exchanges.

Two of them had very good nights. Amy Klobuchar, shedding her Minnesota Nice approach, repeatedly challenged Warren, the first to point out that her Medicare for All plan would boot 150 million Americans off private insurance. I don’t know why the moderators don’t stress that, because Warren is outplaying them in one debate after another.

Marc Lacey of the Times tried three separate times to get Warren to concede what Bernie Sanders already has, that middle-class taxes would rise under her plan. And three times Warren deflected the question by saying the rich and big corporations would pay more for health care and the middle class would pay less, evading the tax question entirely.

It took Pete Buttigieg to call out Warren for failing to answer a simple yes-or-no question. He had perhaps his best debate of the campaign, making an eloquent pitch for moderate ideas. And his strongest moment came in an exchange on Beto O’Rourke’s gun buyback program, when he said: “I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.” Buttigieg, of course, is an Afghanistan war veteran.

On the other hand, he only whacked Beto, who’s going nowhere fast.

Politico’s lead story says: “The candidate who brags about having a plan for everything was pilloried for not detailing how she would pay for her most expensive proposal. She was accused — sometimes subtly, sometimes explicitly — of being naive, dishonest, not adequately respecting her colleagues’ ideas, tearing people down, and failing to enact major legislation. She was attacked for believing in policies that were “punitive” and a theory of governing that was a ‘pipe dream.’”

The debate just wasn’t as rough as that lead made it sound. After all, they ended by talking about Ellen.

The Washington Post declared Warren one of its winners:

“For the first time in one of these debates, Warren found herself under sustained attack. Through a combination of debate format, Joe Biden’s leads in early polls and Warren’s unique political Teflon, she had somehow avoided it. That changed Tuesday, though. Warren was the focal point, with the other candidates all but taking their focus thoroughly off Biden. It wasn’t completely smooth sailing for Warren…but it was an affirmation that she is viewed as perhaps the front-runner now.”

Look, the reason Warren has had such a smooth ride—besides running a very good, issues-based campaign—is that the press pretty much loves her. I’ve lost track of the number of puffy profiles about how she found her voice in Oklahoma, at Harvard, as a bankruptcy lawyer, at the consumer protection agency. She is getting one-hundredth of the media scrutiny that’s been aimed at Biden, who is not a press favorite.

When that changes, you’ll know she’s the front-runner.

As for Biden, he had some strong moments, especially on Syria, but his answers about his son were weak—especially since Hunter Biden confessed to poor judgment on ABC that morning even as his dad was touting his judgment that night. Biden caught a break when Anderson Cooper followed up only once and none of the other Democrats wanted to go there.

The media consensus is that Biden had another uneven night, and he does have a tendency to trip over his words. And yet, despite poor debate reviews and having to play defense on Ukraine, he keeps holding onto his supporters.

The bottom line is that the impeachment drama will quickly drown out this debate, whose 8.3 million viewers represent another decline. There won’t be days of stories about Klobuchar or Buttigieg that might ordinarily give them a chance to break through. If either is to have a shot at becoming Warren’s main moderate rival, the Biden campaign will essentially have to collapse.

Footnote: As if to underscore my point, the dustup between Trump and Democratic leaders--with the president calling the speaker a ""third-rate politician""--bumped the Ohio debate way down on many cable news shows."

Trent Brown, who is in his first season with the Oakland Raiders, was accused of slapping Diorra Marzette-Sanders across the mouth leaving her “bruised, bloodied and battered,” according to Pro Football Talk. Brown is also accused of threatening to shoot Marzette-Sanders in the “f-----g head.”

Here's what you need to know as you start your Thursday ...

BREAKING NEWS: U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md. and House Oversight Committee chairman, died early Thursday at age 68, according to his office. Cummings' office released a statement, saying, ""At approximately 2:45 a.m. on Thursday Oct. 17, 2019, Congressman Elijah E. Cummings (MD-07) passed away at Johns Hopkins Hospital due to complications concerning longstanding health challenges."" Stay with Fox News for further developments

Pelosi, Trump accuse each other of 'meltdown' after Dems storm out of Syria meeting

One thing is clear after top Democrats stormed out of a White House meeting with President Trump on Wednesday: The tension between the president and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has reached a boiling point -- and now observers wonder if they’ll ever be able to work together.

Afterward, Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer held an impromptu news conference outside the White House, telling reporters they walked out of the meeting on Syria policy after Trump allegedly called Pelosi either a ""third-rate politician"" or ""third-grade politician"" and angrily suggested the Democrats probably appreciated communist Islamic State terrorists in the Middle East.

""What we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown, sad to say,"" Pelosi, D-Calif., said. She added later, at the Capitol: ""I pray for the president all the time, and I tell him that -- I pray for his safety and that of his family. Now, we have to pray for his health -- because this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president.""

A senior Democratic aide told Fox News that Trump began the meeting by remarking that ""someone wanted this meeting so I agreed to it."" Trump also reportedly told Pelosi, ""I hate ISIS more than you do,"" prompting Pelosi to respond, ""You don't know that."" The meeting devolved after that point, according to several sources. As the Democrats walked out, Trump reportedly remarked, ""I'll see you at the polls.""

Trump, for his part, tweeted photos from the meeting, including one showing Pelosi standing across the table from him and pointing her finger at the president. Trump captioned the photo, ""Nervous Nancy's unhinged meltdown!"" (Pelosi later used that photo on her official Twitter account.) Click here for more on this story.

Trump tells Turkey’s Erdogan, ‘Don’t be a tough guy,’ ahead of visit from Pence, Pompeo: Before the dramatic developments at the White House, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday he will speak to Vice President Mike Pence and a U.S. delegation heading to Ankara over a potential ceasefire deal in Syria after apparently snubbing the group earlier in the morning. Pence, heading a U.S. contingent that includes Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien, was set to arrive in Turkey on Thursday. House lawmakers overwhelmingly approved a bipartisan resolution opposing Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. forces from northern Syria. Fox Business' Trish Regan exclusively obtained a letter from Trump to Erdogan, urging him, “Don’t be a tough guy. Don’t be a fool,” and ""work out a good deal!""

Biden ramps up attacks on Warren, dismisses her as a fellow front-runner

One day after arguably being overshadowed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren at the Democrats’ debate in Ohio, Joe Biden downplayed her recent gains in the polls and repeatedly criticized the progressive senator from Massachusetts. In Columbus, Ohio, Biden questioned Warren’s honesty and pushed back against the media’s labeling of her as a ""co-front-runner."" “I haven’t seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a front-runner,” Biden said. “You guys keep talking about that.”

Biden's new attacks on Warren come as it appears every member of the ""Squad"" may not be ""all in"" on endorsing Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., just yet.

Rick Perry contacted Giuliani at Trump's direction on concerns about Ukraine corruption: Wall Street Journal

Energy Secretary Rick Perry, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, said President Trump directed him to seek out his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani this spring to address the president's concerns about alleged Ukrainian corruption. The Journal reported that Perry ""said he contacted Mr. Giuliani in an effort to ease a path to a meeting between Mr. Trump and his new Ukrainian counterpart"" and that there were concerns about Ukraine's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Perry told the Journal he never heard Trump or Giuliani discuss the possibility of investigating Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Classes were preemptively canceled Thursday due to the prospect of a job action, though school buildings were scheduled to remain open and meals will be served.

Megyn Kelly calls on NBC to have 'outside investigator' probe shocking sex allegations

In her first televised interview since leaving NBC News last year, Megyn Kelly told Fox News’ Tucker Carlson that the Peacock Network needs an ""outside investigator"" to probe the shocking sexual misconduct allegations made by some former NBC employees. ""There needs to be an outside investigation into this company,” Kelly told Carlson. “They investigated themselves. That doesn't work.”

In his new book, ""Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators,"" Pulitzer-winning journalist Ronan Farrow details the resistance he says he faced from his former bosses at NBC News while reporting on disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein. The book exposes several allegations against former “Today” anchor Matt Lauer. Farrow contends top executives knew about the accusations longer than they claimed and were intent on quashing allegations of sexual misconduct by Weinstein and simultaneously keeping a lid on claims against Lauer.

BUTTIGIEG, KLOBUCHAR GET BIG POST-DEBATE BOOST

Fox News: “Sen. Amy Klobuchar – giddy after a lack of sleep and rave reviews for her debate performance – touted to the jam-packed crowd inside a café in New Hampshire’s capital city that she raised $1.1 million in the 24 hours after Tuesday’s Democratic presidential nomination showdown. The haul was nearly a quarter of what she brought in during the entire July-September third quarter of fundraising. Highlighting that most of the money was from small-dollar contributions, the Minnesota Democrat told reporters ‘that shows something happened, that people were watching and they responded. And that is a very big deal for us.’ As Klobuchar spotlighted her post-debate haul, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who also excelled during the showdown, reported bringing in $1.1 million in the same 24-hours following the debate. His campaign touted that Wednesday was ‘one of our biggest fundraising days yet.’”



Buttigieg draws heat from black activists over fundraiser - AP: “Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is scheduled to attend a Chicago fundraiser that will be co-hosted by a former city attorney who vigorously tried to block the release of a video depicting the shooting of Laquan McDonald , a black teenager whose death at the hands of police stirred months of protest and resulted in an officer’s conviction. Steve Patton, who led Chicago’s law department under former Mayor Rahm Emanuel, is listed as a sponsor of the Friday event, according to an invitation obtained by The Associated Press. For months, Buttigieg has faced criticism over his own handling of race as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, a racially divided city where decades of simmering racial tension erupted this summer when a white police officer shot and killed an African American man. … ‘He should adjust his schedule,’ said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, when asked about the fundraiser.”



Analysis finds Warren $30 trillion short on single-payer plan - Bloomberg: “Elizabeth Warren took a lot of flak at this week’s Democratic presidential debate for being evasive about the taxes needed to pay for the $30 trillion Medicare for All plan she champions. There’s a reason for being vague: Her team hasn’t yet figured out how to pay for it. ‘Her taxes as they currently exist are not enough yet to cover fully replacing health insurance,’ University of California, Berkeley economics professor Emmanuel Saez, who advised the Warren campaign… Warren -- who campaigns on the theme that she has a plan for everything -- is relying on the wealthy and big corporations to pay for her vision of restructuring American society, including funding student debt, free college, universal childcare, green energy and affordable housing plans. … But she has made the strategic decision to adopt Bernie Sanders’ government-run health care plan rather than develop one of her own. … The Warren campaign said they are continuing to review revenue options to fund Medicare for All…”



Tim Alberta: Watching the Dem debate with Michael Bennet - Politico: “The instincts that guide [Michael] Bennet—being pragmatic, deliberative, restrained—are what many Americans say are precisely what’s needed to run the White House. But now, perhaps more than ever, those instincts are the opposite of what’s needed to win the White House. Once upon a time, there was a limited return on investing in outrage and demagoguery; statesmen were in high demand no matter the supply. That’s no longer the case, and not simply because a celebrity showman named Donald Trump is president of the United States. The painful reality of this political moment slides over Bennet like a barbed-wire blanket as he flops onto the couch and kicks off his faded brown dress shoes, preparing for a three-hour reality-television show that will help determine who leads the free world. All the more irksome to Bennet is the fact that five of his fellow senators are staring back at him from beneath the bright lights; he is the only member of the ‘world’s greatest deliberative body’ seeking a promotion who is excluded from the festivities.”



David Brooks: If it’s Trump vs. Warren, then what? - WaPo: “This is a memo for the politically homeless. It’s a memo to those of us who could never support Donald Trump but think the Bernie-Squad-Warren Democratic Party is sprinting too far left. It’s a memo built around the following question: If the general election campaign turns out to be Trump vs. Warren, what the heck are we supposed to do? The first thing we could do, of course, is pray for a miracle. Maybe the Democrats will nominate one of the five B’s or the K: Biden, Buttigieg, Booker, Bennet, Bullock or Klobuchar. These candidates are pluralists, not purists. … And yet, if it comes to Trump vs. Warren in a general election, the only plausible choice is to support Warren. Over the past month Donald Trump has given us fresh reminders of the unique and exceptional ways he corrupts American life. … Politics is downstream from morality and culture. Warren represents a policy wrong turn, in my view, but policies can be argued about and reversed.”



THE RULEBOOK: BUT STILL PROBLEMATIC

“It is at least problematical, whether the decisions of this body do not, in several instances, misconstrue the limits prescribed for the legislative and executive departments, instead of reducing and limiting them within their constitutional places.” – Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 50



TIME OUT: LE EWW, LE GROSS

AFP: “The Paris zoo's latest attraction is a brainless, eyeless, single-celled organism with no limbs or stomach but more than 700 genders. Meet the ‘blob’, also known by its scientific name Physarum polycephalum or ‘many-headed slime.’ Preceding humans on Earth by some 500 million years, the creature resembles a kind of slippery sponge. It appears stationary, but does cover ground – at a leisurely pace of up to [0.4 inches] per hour – in search of prey, such as mushroom spores, bacteria, and other microbes. From Saturday, members of the public can become better acquainted with ‘le blob’, which has taken up residence in a large tank at the zoo in Paris' Bois de Vincennes park. Named after the 1958 sci-fi horror movie ‘The Blob’ about an alien creature that crashes to Earth and devours residents of Pennsylvania, the real-life blob consists of a single cell, sometimes with many nuclei that can replicate their DNA and divide.”

MULVANEY INCREASES WHITE HOUSE MISERY INDEX

WaPo: “For 39 minutes Thursday, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney turned the press briefing room into a sort of confession chamber, openly admitting to several acts that could deepen the legal predicament for the president. [Donald] Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry into whether he has abused his office for personal and political gain. … In admitting that Trump had personally intervened to award a multimillion-dollar summit to his own company, and that the president had also used taxpayer money as leverage to push a Ukrainian investigation into Democrats, Mulvaney embraced a classic Trumpian tactic: saying the quiet — and potentially illegal — part out loud. But that strategy with regard to Ukraine came in for withering criticism after Mulvaney’s appearance, and he later tried to walk back his comments. In a statement late Thursday, Mulvaney denied the quid pro quo he had previously defended as appropriate and normal.”



State Department official: Obama administration ignored Biden warnings - Fox News: “A State Department official focused on Ukraine policy told Congress this week he raised concerns about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas firm in 2015, but was rebuffed by former Vice President Joe Biden’s staff, Fox News has confirmed. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, who testified behind closed doors before committees spearheading the formal House impeachment inquiry, told congressional investigators that he had qualms about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings. … A congressional source confirmed to Fox News on Friday that Kent testified that when he brought his concerns to the office of the vice president in 2016, his staff ‘blew him off’ and ignored the issue involving the younger Biden's role at the firm.”



Support steady for impeachment probe - Pew Research Center: “The new survey by Pew Research Center … finds that 54% currently approve of the House’s decision to conduct an impeachment inquiry, while 44% disapprove. Neither party engenders a great deal of confidence that they will be ‘fair and reasonable’ during the impeachment inquiry, the survey finds. About four-in-ten (43%) expect that the Republicans in Congress will be fair in handling the inquiry, while slightly more (47%) say the same about the Democrats in Congress. The survey, conducted on Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel, enables us to examine opinions about impeachment among the same group of respondents over the past month.”



Rick Perry announces year-end departure amid increasing scrutiny - NPR: “Secretary of Energy Rick Perry plans to leave his position at the end of the year, President Trump confirmed to reporters Thursday in Fort Worth, Texas. Trump praised Perry and said he already has a replacement in mind. ‘Rick has done a fantastic job,’ Trump said. ‘But it was time.’ Trump said that Perry's resignation didn't come as a surprise and that he has considered leaving for six months because ‘he's got some very big plans.’ Perry, 69, is one of Trump's original Cabinet members and recently has emerged as a central figure in the impeachment inquiry of Trump. Perry was part of what was dubbed ‘the three amigos’ — in addition to Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt Volker, former envoy to Ukraine — charged with managing the U.S.-Ukraine relationship after the White House removed the core of its Ukraine policy team last spring.”



DEMS BUILD CASH CASTELLATION AROUND HOUSE MAJORITY

Politico: “Democrats are building a financial bulwark around their House majority that’s going to be tough for Republicans to breach in 2020. Thirty-three of the 44 most vulnerable House Democrats have stashed an impressive $1 million or more in the bank well before the election year even begins. And their fundraising pace is not slowing down as they gear up to defend the chamber. Federal Election Commission reports filed this week illustrate Democrats’ formidable advantage: The 44 Democrats in the most competitive seats banked a collective $59 million so far. Nearly 30 raised $500,000 or more in the third quarter, according to a POLITICO analysis of the fundraising filings. And all but six of the so-called ‘frontliners’ have at least half a million more banked than their challengers, if they have any challenger at all. … The GOP is struggling to adapt to a changing landscape; They can no longer dismiss the strong fundraising as an anomaly when it has remained steady throughout the first three quarters of 2019.”



Can anyone beat AOC? - NYT: “It is hard to imagine a scenario where Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez loses her seat next year. She has raised more than $3.4 million, is better known than some presidential candidates and handily won a district that is among the bluest in the nation. But that hasn’t stopped people — lots of them — from trying to unseat her. So far, eight Republicans and three Democrats have filed to run for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s seat in the Bronx and Queens. Two of the Republicans have each raised more than $420,000, even though no Republican has represented the Bronx in Congress in at least 50 years. … The campaigns also highlight a broader strategy by the Republican Party: turning voters’ resentment toward Ms. Ocasio-Cortez into a conduit for the party’s other electoral goals.”



POLL SHOWS GARDNER TRAILING HICKENLOOPER

KMGH: “New Colorado polling released Thursday shows that John Hickenlooper leads Sen. Cory Gardner in a theoretical Senate matchup next year by 11 percentage points and that a majority of Coloradans support the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. The Keating Research-OnSight Public Affairs-Martin Campaigns (KOM) survey released Thursday afternoon was conducted by the Democratic pollsters Oct. 10-14 and polled 500 active statewide voters who cast ballots in 2016, 2017 or 2018 or signed up to vote since last November. The poll was weighted to be in line with voter turnout demographics and the margin of error was ±4.4% and was paid for by KOM.”



Former Republican launches Kansas Senate bid as a Democrat - The Wichita [Kan.] Eagle: “A Kansas lawmaker who left the Republican Party last year now hopes to become the first Kansas Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate in decades. State Sen. Barbara Bollier launched her campaign for U.S. Senate on Wednesday by promising an independent approach. She condemned dysfunction in Washington as she seeks to replace retiring Republican Sen. Pat Roberts. … Bollier, of Mission Hills in Johnson County, is the fourth Democrat in the race and the ninth candidate overall – joining a sprawling field that includes Republicans Rep. Roger Marshall and former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. In the Democratic contest, she will have to overcome serious campaigns by former federal prosecutor Barry Grissom and Manhattan Mayor Pro Tem Usha Reddi.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“A small, but important correction. It is not the American Air Force at work in Syria. It is either the American air force or it is the United States Air Force/U.S. Air Force, from which I am retired with 21 years of service. The same goes for the American army or the American navy. I agree with capitalizing proper names, but prefer that it be done properly. I'm a faithful reader, an independent politically, and I appreciate your non-partisan approach. Sometimes it feels as though we who prefer listening, thinking and discussing rationally are but drowning voices in a maelstrom of partisan fury. The Halftime Report is one of the very few media outlets that I feel I can trust to report accurately and to make projections which are supported reasonably. Thank you for the time and effort you and your team put into keeping us informed.” – Dave Riley, Kasilof, Alaska



[Ed. note: Good point, Mr. Riley! Certainly no disrespect intended. I was swerving from overuse of U.S. and ran off the other side of the road. Thank you so much for your kind words, readership and, most of all, your service.]



“Chris, I hope the new Syrian ceasefire lasts longer than your pledge to remain neutral about Trump in your Halftime Report.” – Scott Lyddon, Savannah, Ga.



[Ed. note: I’ve got to give it to you, Mr. Lyddon. That was pretty good! And since the cease fire seems to have ended before it really began, you may be now doubly right from your own perspective. I would remind you though that the goal here isn’t to be “neutral,” but rather to be useful. Fair analysis will necessarily include criticism. If there were no criticism – true neutrality – we would lose the capacity to render necessary judgments. My promise to you, however, is that I do not and will not make judgement about ideological rights and wrongs. As we wrote Thursday, we hold harmless those who either support or oppose the president’s policies in Syria. The same goes for the competing opinions about whether the president should be removed from office for leaning on the Ukrainians to investigate his political foes. Both positions are defensible and substantially irrelevant to my work. Our point Thursday was that however you feel about the policies, Trump’s chaotic governance and indiscipline is creating political liabilities. This week has been a brutal one for the administration, most of it needlessly so. I hope, whatever resentments you may hold for my rejection of neutrality, you still find the analysis useful.]



“As much as I admire moderation in the body politic, it seems that we are rapidly approaching a choice for those of us with (R) on our voting status. I find much of the President's language and combative behavior appalling, however he is generally consistent with my views on policy. But I am APPALLED by the full throated embrace of Socialism that is occurring on the other ‘side of the aisle.’ If we ‘moderate conservatives’ sit this one out (as probably occurred with the evangelical Christians in 2012), I believe the result could be an upheaval of our American way of life, facilitated by the most massive transfer of wealth in history.” – Patsy Fields, Aliso Viejo, Calif.



[Ed. note: Well, I’ve got good news and bad news for you, Ms. Fields. The bad news is that we are indeed already in the midst of an upheaval of American life. The changes we’re seeing in how we live, work, play, worship, mate, learn and communicate are massive in scope. You would have to go back a century or more to find a moment that even comes close to the enormous societal and, consequently, political change that has wracked American society over the past 20 years. No matter how you vote, that toothpaste isn’t going back in the tube. Neither party nor any politician has the answer for dealing with all of these changes. The far left believes economic collectivism based on an ambition for social justice is the answer, while the far right champions a sort of cultural collectivism supported by economic nationalism in which the government works to engineer a new American culture to its supporters liking. Both will probably fail to achieve their highest aims. And that’s the good news. As we have done many times before, the rest of us will just have to figure it out, making it up as we go. It’s going to be bumpy, but I remain confident that it’s going to be great.]

OH, FLOYD

NY Daily News: “A leisurely Sunday afternoon hike on a mountain trail outside of Salt Lake City turned into an animal rescue after Floyd, a 3-year-old, 190-pound Mastiff, decided he was too tired to descend and wouldn’t budge. Around 6:30 p.m. as temperatures were dropping, rescuers were called after other hikers stumbled upon Floyd and his owner. Luckily, the all-volunteer Salt Lake County Sheriff’s Office search and rescue team was able strap Floyd into a stretcher and carry the big fella down to the trailhead without further incident. ‘They had no hesitation whatsoever, even when they heard it was a dog,’ Sgt. Melody Gray of the Unified Police Department, which works with the sheriff’s search and rescue team, told CNN. She added the whole operation lasted about four hours.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“What’s so remarkable is that constitutions are highly reactionary documents. The very essence of a constitution is to constrain the enthusiasms of a future that one cannot even see.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) in a column from Krauthammer’s posthumous book, “The Point of It All,” published in the Washington Post on Nov. 29, 2018.

The dreaded “Madden” curse has plagued NFL superstars who have been on the cover of the video game for years and Mahomes, the cover star of this year's installment of the video game franchise, appears to be the latest victim.

PATRICK MAHOMES INJURY DRAWS UNSETTLING REACTIONS FROM CHIEFS TEAMMATES: 'IT LOOKED DEFORMED'

Mahomes was coming off an NFL MVP season and 12-4 record as the Chiefs QB in 2018, throwing for a league-leading 50 touchdown passes. Mahomes was having a solid season through six-and-a-half games, leading the NFL with 2,180 passing yards and 15 touchdown passes.

It all came into an end Thursday when it appeared he suffered a devastating knee injury against the Broncos. However, the NFL Network reported that Mahomes suffered a dislocated kneecap and might be able to play through it after three weeks of rest.

It wasn’t the first time the “Madden” curse struck this season.

PATRICK MAHOMES INJURY DAMAGES KANSAS CITY CHIEFS' SUPER BOWL ODDS

NFL fans blamed the jinx for derailing Antonio Brown’s career. He was on the cover of “Madden 19” for last year’s installment of the game. While Brown had a good year for the Pittsburgh Steelers, his rift with teammates led the organization to trade him.

He then suffered a frostbite mishap during the offseason, and ironically enough “Madden 19” used a Frostbite graphics engine to “make you feel like you’re in the game every time you pick up the sticks.” The engine debuted during “Madden 18,” with Tom Brady on the cover.

The ""Madden"" curse has been blamed for the down years and injuries of several superstars, including Rob Gronkowski, who was on the front of the 2017 installment, Michael Vick, Shaun Alexander and Vince Young. The hex’s history can be traced all the way back to 1999 when Barry Sanders was on the cover of “Madden 2000,"" only to abruptly retire."

“If the president ever wants me to go out and take that podium, I will happily do it,” Grisham told “Fox & Friends.”

“As evidenced by yesterday with Mick, it was, again, more theater. It is about people wanting to be on TV and making names for themselves,” Grisham said, adding that Mulvaney ""did a great job.""

FLEISCHER: MICK MULVANEY MADE A 'TERRIBLE MISTAKE' BY CONTRADICTING THE PRESIDENT

Mulvaney seemed to contradict President Trump’s claim that there was no “quid pro quo” during his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky by telling reporters at the White House press conference that the release of military aid to Ukraine was tied to the administration’s demands that Kiev investigate purported corruption by the Democrats during the 2016 presidential election campaign.

MULVANEY COMMENTS SEIZED ON BY CRITICS SAYING IT'S PROOF OF UKRAINE QUID PRO QUO

When questioned by reporters about the administration’s decision to withhold $400 million in aid from Ukraine, Mulvaney said that Trump told him at the time: ""This is a corrupt place. Everyone knows this is a corrupt place ... Plus, I'm not sure that the other European countries are helping them out either.”

Mulvaney added: “Did [Trump] also mention to me, in the past, the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that’s it. And that’s why we held up the money ... The look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. And that is absolutely appropriate.”

Grisham said the media got themselves ""in a tizzy"" so Mulvaney later clarified and said ""there was absolutely no quid pro quo.""

“He was over there for more than 30 minutes. He took probably 40 questions. People were talking over one another. He did a great job. He mentioned the same message over and over and over,” Grisham said.

She said Trump holds many briefings with reporters and ""there's no better spokesman,"" lessening the need for the daily sessions held by her predecessors Sarah Sanders and Sean Spicer.

THE CHAOS CAUCUS GETS ITS WAY

If you read this note you certainly have more than a passing interest in politics. In fact, you’re probably one of the people to whom your friends and family turn when it comes to sorting out questions political or governmental.



That's why one of our goals each day is to so equip you. We like it if you’re the smartest political person in the room.



So if they ask you today what in the h-e-double-hockey-sticks is going on, just tell them this: The two most powerful people in the American government – the system conceived by the Founders, purchased and defended with the lives of more than a million men at arms – is the specific insult the president used toward the speaker of the house.



Hoo-boy…



President Trump said that he called Nancy Pelosi a “third-grade politician.” Pelosi and others at the brief, useless meeting on the ongoing debacle in Syria say that Trump called her a “third-rate politician.”



We will not waste your time or test your credulity by talking about how unworthy this is of our republic or of the armed forces the two were supposedly meeting to discuss, or any of that “School House Rock” goody-goody stuff. It’s 2019. We get it.



But ask yourselves what comes next.



On the 1,000th day of Trump’s presidency we find a city and a system unraveled. If we take the long view we can observe that this is, in fact, what Americans voted for in 2016. Trump promised to bring combative, disruptive partisan warfare to levels unseen even during recent low points like the Clinton impeachment and the Iraq War.



Trump has delivered on his promise to disrupt, a promise he made to core supporters starting in June 2015. One of the reasons that his devotees are attached to him in a way that sometimes border on the religious is because he has kept faith with these voters every day of his presidency. Trump likes to boast that he is a builder, but his base hired him for a demolition job.



To win the presidency, though, Trump relied on the support of voters who felt differently – a bloc at least as large as his core followership. The mandate from these voters was not to turn Washington into an apocalyptic hellscape of turgid partisanship but rather just not be Hillary Clinton.



We imagine that those voters have watched the events of the past two months in some combination of fascination, shock, amusement and horror. The cause of such consternation is pretty simple: There is very little left in Trump’s administration that reflects the winning coalition of 2016 between Trump’s populist pitchforkers and the center-right Republican establishment.



Think of it this way – Trump succeeded in an audacious hostile takeover of the Republican Party. But after the establishment was defeated, many members of the old firm stayed on in this new joint venture.



Reince Priebus, Nikki Haley, James Mattis, Rex Tillerson, John Kelly, Kirstjen Nielsen, Jeff Sessions, Tom Price, Elaine Chao, Dan Coats, Mick Mulvaney and Mike Pence all hitched up for the new joint venture between Trump Inc. and the GOP.



It’s down to Mulvaney, Chao and Pence, and if we were Mulvaney we wouldn’t worry about renewing our parking pass for next month.



What that means is that Trump is substantially getting the government he wanted and promised, one in which he is unconstrained by convention, tradition or nearly any rules of the road. He envisioned that as president he could operate in the same way he did as the CEO of his family business.



Of course, as it turns out, he cannot. But he has run out of those individuals who, for the first 900-or-so days, managed to make things run in some kind of orderly way.



Consider the twin snares in which Trump now finds himself bound: Impending impeachment and the foreign policy meltdown in Syria. Both are the result of Trump doing things his way rather than the Washington way.



Any chief of staff worth his salt would have dived in front of that phone call to the Ukrainian president like it was a runaway dump truck. Whether you think Trump acted appropriately or not, he conducted himself in such a way that gave his critics all the ammunition that they needed. One day after Robert Mueller’s testimony snuffed out the already dying embers of impeachment talk in Congress, Trump picked up the phone and started a conflagration.



Any national security adviser in any previous administration would have done everything but swat the phone out of the president’s hand if he was telling Turkey’s strongman president that the U.S. would clear the way for Turkish forces to pummel our Kurdish allies.



Again, you may actually agree with the policy of feeding the Kurds to the Turks, but we are left in a situation where the American Air Force is bombing American military installations to keep them out of the hands of rapidly advancing hostile forces. Those are procedural, not policy problems.



The next 12 months will determine what, if any, legacy Trump will leave behind. Trump re-elected, Trump defeated, Trump impeached but preserved by the Senate and Trump impeached and removed are all real possibilities. And no one will have as much to say about which of those eventualities comes to pass as Trump himself.



His team is in disarray and his administration lurches daily from disaster to disaster. If he does not find a way to change that it won’t matter how bad the Democrats’ nominee is, Trump will never see a second term.



Given the fact that today’s White House press conference was to announce Trump’s decision to host world leaders next year at one of his family’s golf resorts, we get the sense that maybe that reality has not yet taken root in the West Wing.



THE RULEBOOK: FOCUS ON THE POSITIVES

“They have chosen rather to dwell on the inconveniences which must be unavoidably blended with all political advantages; and on the possible abuses which must be incident to every power or trust, of which a beneficial use can be made.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 41



TIME OUT: TIMELESS JULIE ANDREWS

Atlantic: “Home Work, [Julie Andrews] second memoir (this one co-published with her eldest daughter, Emma Walton Hamilton), is an account of what happened between Andrews’s film debut in 1964’s Mary Poppins and her performance in the 1982 movie Victor/Victoria. The motivation for the book, Andrews told [The Atlantic], was twofold. After the 2008 publication of her first memoir, Home, which detailed her difficult childhood and her earliest days as a performer, fans and friends had urged her to dive into the next phase. ‘The first one ended as I was heading to Hollywood,’ she said, ‘so of course everybody said, ‘When, when, when are you going to do the next one?’ Because they wanted to hear all that.’ Home, in other words, ended right before the moment when Andrews took the role that would change her life. The book is a dance between candor and diplomacy, as Andrews navigates the imperative of honesty with the courteousness that seems to be her governing instinct.”

I’LL TELL YOU WHAT: RESTING PETE FACE

This week Dana Perino and Chris Stirewalt give their thoughts on the fourth Democratic Presidential primary debate, the continued controversy between the NBA and China and Dana has fun with Chris's new memoji. Plus, Chris answers some primary trivia. LISTEN AND SUBSCRIBE HERE



OUTPOURING FOR ELIJAH CUMMINGS, LION OF THE HOUSE

Baltimore Sun: “U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Baltimore, a committee chairman known for his devotion to Baltimore and civil rights and for blunt and passionate speechmaking, died of longstanding health problems early Thursday morning, his office said. He was 68 years old. The Democrat, a key figure in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump as chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, died at Gilchrist Hospice Care, a Johns Hopkins affiliate, at approximately 2:45 A.M., a spokeswoman said. Cummings, who had been absent from Capitol Hill in recent weeks while under medical attention, had health issues in recent years. In 2017, he underwent an aortic valve replacement. The procedure, which aides described as minimally invasive in Cummings’ case, is used to correct narrowing of the aortic valve in the heart. The surgery led to an infection that kept him in the hospital longer than expected.”



LATE IN THE RACE, DEM FAULT LINES EMERGE

WaPo: “As the party’s fourth debate concluded, the Democratic primary contest opened a more robust and unpredictable clash over the ideological direction of the party, with moderates attempting to ignite the kind of passion that the liberal candidates have harnessed with large crowds and grass-roots donor networks. After months in which the race was largely static amid a crowded, free-ranging field, the nomination fight is showing signs of narrowing its focus to fewer candidates, divided into parallel feuds in the liberal and moderate wings of the party. [Elizabeth] Warren (Mass.) is entering a crucial phase of her campaign, taking attacks from all sides for the first time since she ascended in popularity, and attempting to demonstrate she can withstand the kind of scrutiny that previously fell mostly on [Joe] Biden, who until recently held an unchallenged lead in the polls. Yet as she attempts to coalesce support on the party’s left flank, Warren faces a renewed challenge from liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)… The left’s feud is replicated in the center, where Biden faces challenges from [Pete] Buttigieg, [Amy] Klobuchar and others.”



Biden dismisses Warren as a fellow front-runner - Fox News: “One day after being overshadowed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren at the Democrats’ latest debate, Joe Biden repeatedly criticized the progressive senator from Massachusetts, whose status has risen in recent months, making her a presidential primary front-runner alongside the former vice president. In Columbus, Ohio, Biden questioned Warren’s honesty and pushed back against the media’s labeling of Warren as a ‘co-front-runner.’ ‘I haven’t seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a front-runner,’ Biden said. ‘You guys keep talking about that.’ Biden did acknowledge, in referencing the latest polls, that ‘Warren has done very well. She’s moved.’”



RNC raises record-setting $27.3 million in September - Fox News: “The Republican National Committee raised a record-setting $27.3 million in September and had $59.2 million cash on hand last month amid the impeachment push against President Trump -- which has fueled GOP campaign contributions heading into the 2020 election. The RNC’s September fundraising haul is the best off-cycle month in the history of both the Republican and Democratic parties. This cycle, to date, the RNC has almost tripled the Democratic National Committee’s fundraising efforts, according to the GOP, which also noted that the Democrats, as of last month, carried $7.3 million in debt. ‘While Democrats focus on fighting President Trump, Republicans have prioritized voters and we have another record-breaking fundraising month—the highest ever off-cycle—to show for it,’ RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told Fox News.”



DEMS FACE TIMING QUESTION WITH IMPEACHMENT

Politico: “Democrats are in an impeachment bind. For the first time, they’re receiving a gusher of evidence to support charges that President Donald Trump abused his power for political and personal gain, pressuring Ukraine’s fledgling government to investigate his political rival Joe Biden. But as more witnesses come forward to spill more secrets, the more Democrats are nervously eyeing the dwindling congressional calendar and wondering: When should we be satisfied with what we have and bring articles of impeachment to the floor? … Some Democrats say the investigation should continue until the evidence is so overwhelming it pries loose a few Republican votes, delivering a symbolic victory as Democrats hold out hope that impeachment isn’t a purely party-line issue. Others believe Democrats should exhaust the list of willing witnesses before drafting formal articles. And still others say the House already has enough evidence to move forward with impeachment immediately — from Trump’s own admission…”



McConnell readies party members for impeachment trial - WaPo: “Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told Republican senators Wednesday to be ready for an impeachment trial of President Trump as soon as Thanksgiving, as the Senate began to brace for a political maelstrom that would engulf the nation. An air of inevitability has taken hold in Congress, with the expectation Trump will become the third president in history to be impeached — and Republicans believe they need to prepare to defend the president. While McConnell briefed senators on what would happen during a Senate trial, House GOP leaders convened what they expect will be regular impeachment strategy sessions. In their closed-door weekly luncheon, McConnell gave a PowerPoint presentation about the impeachment process and fielded questions alongside his staff and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who was a manager for the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton.”



Perry says Trump sent him to Giuliani - Fox News: “Energy Secretary Rick Perry, whose name has been mentioned in connection with President Trump’s Ukraine dealings, said in an interview published late Wednesday that the president told him to seek out Rudy Giuliani earlier this year to look into possible Ukrainian corruption. The Wall Street Journal sat down with Perry for an extensive interview and reported that the spring conversation was a sign of how closely Giuliani — a personal lawyer for Trump — worked on Ukraine policy. Giuliani's business dealings with the country were reportedly looked at by federal investigators. He denied any wrongdoing. ‘Visit with Rudy,’ Perry recalled Trump telling him. He told the paper that Trump was not convinced that Kiev ‘straightened up’ its act. Perry told the paper he never heard Trump or Giuliani talk about an investigation into the Bidens.”



Volker’s testimony revealed more concerns about Giuliani - Axios: “New details from Kurt Volker's closed-door interview indicate Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, was deeply conflicted about whether to take the job because of concerns about Rudy Giuliani's shadow involvement. Why it matters: The testimony by Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, earlier this month may help the president in the sense that it paints Giuliani, not President Trump, as the mastermind behind a campaign to get foreign leaders to investigate the Biden family and Burisma, according to sources with direct knowledge of his testimony. But it also amplifies concerns that Trump was more interested in what his personal lawyer had to say than the professionals in government. Taylor was also worried that Trump might be willing to trade away Ukraine's interests as part of a grand bargain with Russia, Volker told lawmakers. Taylor is expected to appear before members of Congress next week.”



The Judge’s Ruling: It’s impeachable if the House says it is - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains if President Trump right when he says the impeachment inquiry is unfair: “The illegitimacy argument contended that since the House has yet to vote to authorize an investigation of the president, its committees lack subpoena power. This argument contends that since impeachment seeks to overturn a valid election, it is a thinly veiled coup and thus is in violation of the Constitution. And the argument about unfairness states that the president is entitled to due process at every stage of the impeachment proceedings. These are valid political arguments. But as legal offerings, they are profoundly misguided. … Impeachment is always constitutional if it originates in the House and if its basis is arguably for treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” More here.

FLEA MARKET CHEESE? REALLY?

Fresno [Calif.] Bee: “Lemoore [Calif.] police are investigating the theft of $50,000 in cheese in a crime that is believed to reach back to 2017. The investigation, launched in late August, centers around products from Leprino Foods Plant in the 300 block of Belle Haven Drive in the South Valley city. A police spokeswoman said multiple subjects have been linked to the thefts and the cheese has been sold from Fresno to Riverside counties: door-to-door, on the street, at flea markets and on social media sites. After serving warrants, detectives recovered a large amount of cheese and arrested Jairo Mariano Osorio Alvarez, 24, and Roderick Domingo Ransom, 34, both of Lemoore.”

Ocasio-Cortez, who has quickly become one of the most prominent left-wing House lawmakers since taking office in January, backed Sanders formally at the rally in Long Island City.

OCASIO-CORTEZ, OMAR, TLAIB TO ENDORSE BERNIE SANDERS

""It wasn't until I heard of a man by the name of Bernie Sanders that I began to question and assert and recognize my inherent value as a human being that deserves health care, housing, education and a living wage,” she said.

In her remarks, she talked about her own personal story of growing up in New York and painted a grim picture of America, telling the crowd: “We are all always, it feels like, one accident from everything falling apart and we have to change the fundamental logic of a system and a politics that puts corp profit ahead of all human and planetary costs.”

But she said Sanders had spent decades for fighting for those things to make life for her better, such as the Children’s Health Insurance Plan (CHIP), universal health care, and student debt forgiveness.

“Bernie Sanders did not do these things because they were popular and that’s what we need to remember,” she said. “No one wanted to question this system and in 2016 he fundamentally changed politics in America.”

The endorsement from Ocasio-Cortez, along with other members of The Squad, -- the progressive group of freshman lawmakers -- marks a needed win for Sanders during a difficult few weeks for his campaign.

He has found himself trailing behind both former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in a number of polls, and has been recovering from surgery after a heart attack. The latter has raised questions about his stamina for not only the grueling presidential race, but also at least a term in the White House.

In his remarks on Saturday, Sanders sought to quash doubts about whether he could continue, stressing his commitment to continuing his “political revolution”

Burisma Holdings founder Mykola Zlochevsky hired the son of former Vice President Joe Biden to ""protect"" the company in the face of prosecution, the Review reported.

Zlochevsky faced investigation in Ukraine and was initially cleared of wrongdoing for tax violations, money laundering and corruption. But earlier this month Ukrainian Prosecutor General Ruslan Ryaboshapka said 15 cases involving Zlochevsky would be reviewed, according to The National Review.

Biden’s work with the company has come under scrutiny after President Trump alleged that Joe Biden inappropriately used his diplomatic influence in Ukraine to help his son.

No evidence of wrongdoing has been found and both Joe Biden and Hunter Biden deny the allegations. Hunter Biden has since pledged to avoid business deals with foreign entities if his father becomes president.

A July phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- in which Trump asked his counterpart to investigate the Bidens -- led the Democrat-controlled House to start the Trump impeachment inquiry earlier this month.

“I hate to say it, but our opponents are way ahead of us when it comes to money in the bank,” a campaign fundraising email for Biden said. “If we don’t pick up the pace here, we might have to make budget cuts that could seriously hurt our momentum in this primary.”

Less cash on hand means the campaign will struggle to respond to “twists and turns of this race — and with Donald Trump constantly pushing his false smear campaign against Joe, that’s a HUGE problem,” the letter says.

The letter closes with an appeal, according to The Hill.

AMID BIDEN’S CASH WOES, CAMPAIGN VOWS IT HAS THE MONEY ‘TO RUN OUR RACE’

As Biden was on the debate stage Tuesday night, his third quarter of fundraising filing to the Federal Election Commission was making headlines.

According to the report, Biden had just under $9 million in his campaign coffers after spending more money than he raised during the July-September fundraising quarter. That’s far less than Warren, who reported $25.7 million cash on hand, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, another top tier rival who reported having $33.7 million in the bank.

Democratic operative Michael Ceraso described the new Biden cash on hand figure as troubling.

Ceraso, who worked on Sanders’ 2016 campaign and who parted ways this summer with the Buttigieg campaign, warned that Biden needs to remain in the top tier conversation or “his cash flow may dry up as the primary enters the homestretch, which may prevent the VP from competing and challenging his opponents in Super Tuesday states and beyond.”

The plan would be paid for with a tax on stock trades, bonds, derivatives and other types of investments. The Vermont lawmaker called the plan ""a revolutionary proposal.""

Williamson said ""everyone had a bad night"" at Tuesday's fourth Democratic presidential debate and that the candidates' lackluster performances are why she isn't dropping out of the race.

In an op-ed she wrote for The Washington Post on Wednesday, Williamson -- who failed to meet the criteria to take part in the fourth-round debate -- criticized the Democratic National Committee, saying political insiders are parading around a ""repackaged"" nominating process that she called a ""faux democracy.""

On Thursday, Williamson cited America's first president, George Washington.

As Klobuchar spotlighted her post-debate haul, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who also excelled during the showdown, reported bringing in $1.1 million in the same 24-hours following the debate.

His campaign touted that Wednesday was “one of our biggest fundraising days yet.” And Buttigieg communications director Lis Smith showcased that the campaign “saw more traffic to their website in the past 24 hours than any other day.”

At the debate, both Buttigieg and Klobuchar took aim at co-front runner Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts over how she’d pay for her proposed government-run Medicare-for-all plan.

The aggressive moves throughout the debate by both Buttigieg and Klobuchar literally paid off. And the potential surge for the two candidates trying to appeal to more centrist voters in the party could spell trouble for another more establishment contender: former Vice President Joe Biden.

AMID BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN CASH WOES, TOP ADVISERS VOW THEY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY

Biden was the unrivaled front-runner in the race from even before he declared his candidacy in late April. But Warren caught up with him this autumn in many of the most recent national and early voting state polls. And Biden’s been eclipsed by Warren, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Buttigieg when it comes to the crucial fundraising race.

According to his Federal Election Commission filing, Biden had just under $9 million in his campaign coffers after spending more money than he raised the past three months. That’s far less than Sanders, Warren, and even Buttigieg.

“This week's debate was the best yet for Mayor Pete and Sen. Klobuchar and came at a moment of prime opportunity for them,” noted Ben LaBolt, a Democratic strategist who served as a spokesman on Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign and national press secretary on the president’s 2012 re-election campaign.

LaBolt spotlighted that “Biden's vote share is more gettable for pragmatic candidates like Buttigieg and Klobuchar than it is for Warren. The challenge now is to present a vision that shows what they could achieve in office versus a more systemically disruptive vision from Sen. Warren. The clock is ticking in Iowa and New Hampshire for that message to reach the remaining persuadable voters.”

Klobuchar, on frenetic post-debate swing through all 10 counties in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state, appears to get it.

She called her performance in this week’s debate “critical.” And with just three and a half months to go until the primaries and caucuses kick off, she emphasized “this is when the campaign season begins.”"

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is an independent agency of the U.S. government, responsible for consumer protection in the financial sector. It was created by Congress in 2010 to be an autonomous entity, structured so each director serves a five-year term and can only be removed for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”

MICHAEL MOORE ENDORSES BERNIE SANDERS: 'HE ISN'T AFRAID TO SAY CAPITALISM IS THE PROBLEM'

Warren, D-Mass., touted on the campaign trail that the bureau returned $12 billion to consumers during the Obama administration, The Washington Post reported. She uses the figure to push a presidential platform based on attacking corporate greed and increasing taxes on wealthy Americans.

“Big banks and their Republican allies have been trying to kill the CFPB for years, and the Trump administration is hoping the right-wing, pro-corporate Supreme Court will help. I’ve got news for them: Like it or not, the CFPB is constitutional,” Warren said on Twitter.

An attorney for the Trump administration told the Supreme Court in a brief last month that even the bureau’s current director, Kathleen Kraninger, who was sworn in in 2018, believes the structure of the CFPB violates the separation of powers clause of the Constitution given its director cannot be fired by the president without sufficient cause.

Critics of the bureau say the Constitution gives the president the power to remove top-ranking executive branch officials for any reason or none at all. They say the founders were wary of power being entrusted to any one individual who had not been elected into office, the Washington Times reported.

The Supreme Court “has consistently recognized that the Constitution empowers the president to keep federal officers accountable by removing them from office,” Washington lawyer Kannon K. Shanmugam wrote in the brief, according to The Washington Post.

“While in limited circumstances the court has upheld the constitutionality of certain multi-member ‘independent’ agencies ... the court has never upheld the constitutionality of an independent agency that exercises significant executive authority and is headed by a single person.”

Republicans and banking executives have opposed the bureau since its inception, arguing it often pushing legal margins to slap unnecessary penalties on financial intuitions. White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney once described the bureau as “a joke” and supported legislation to disband it, the Post reported.

Lower court ruling on the constitutionality of the bureau have been conflicting. A three-judge panel on the Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, which included then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh before he became a Supreme Court Justice, ruled the CFPB was unconstitutional. The entire court later overturned the decision, the Times reported."

The candidates don't seem to be competing to see who can run the country most efficiently. That's the old style of politics.

Instead, these candidates are pledging to remake America entirely. Rip out the old, which is. they're telling us, irredeemably tainted by racism, sexism and free enterprise, and replace it with something completely new and different.

At the heart of this effort is the promise of ""Medicare-for-all."" Now, you may have heard the phrase. Two of the most popular Democratic candidates, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both have endorsed it. But what exactly does it mean? What exactly is ""Medicare-for-all""?

SANDERS ACCUSES BIDEN OF PUSHING INSURANCE INDUSTRY 'TALKING POINTS' BY SLAMMING 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

It's worth finding out. It's not a tweak to some regulation. It's not even ObamaCare, which once upon a time Democrats defended and Republicans denounced as socialism.

""Medicare-for-all"" is actual socialism, for-real socialism. Health care spending amounts to about a fifth of the entire American economy. Elizabeth Warren demands total control of all of it -- immediately. That's ""Medicare-for-all."" If it becomes law, it would amount to the largest expansion of the federal government since the second World War -- by far.

So it's worth asking how exactly all of this would work and critically, who would pay for it. Elizabeth Warren has been asked that question many times, and every time, she has refused to answer.

Marc Lacey, national editor for The New York Times: Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it? Yes or no?

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.: The costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down. Hard-working, middle-class families are going to see their costs go down.

Stephen Colbert, host of ""The Late Show"": But will their taxes go up?

Warren: Well -- but here's the thing ...

Colbert: But here's the thing, I've listened to these answers a few times before --

George Stephanopoulos, ABC News host: Will middle-class taxes go up? Will private insurance be eliminated?

Warren: Look, what families have to deal with is cost -- total cost. That's what they have to deal with.

Warren: It's how much are your costs going to go down ...

Chris Matthews, host of ""Hardball"": No, no. Different question. How much of your taxes go up?

Warren: No, it's how much your cost --

Matthews: How is it a different question?

Warren: It is how much families end up spending.

Matthews: I know that argument, but will you pay more in taxes? Why don't you want to answer that question because as Jake said tonight, that's a Republican talking point. It's not a Republican talking point. It's a question.

Warren: It's a question about where people are going to come out economically.

Matthews: That's not my question.

Warren: I spent --

She will not answer. She won't explain, no matter how hard she has been pressed. And as you just saw, even some fairly strident Democratic partisans have pressed her.

Warren refuses. She will not explain what it would cost or who would pay for it.

Details, like what things cost or whether something is constitutional, or even if the majority of Americans want it, none of that seems to interest Elizabeth Warren anymore.

Well, now we have a credible estimate. According to a study by the Urban Institute, in just the first 10 years, Elizabeth Warren's ""Medicare-for-all"" plan would cost an additional $34 trillion.

That sounds like a lot. How much is it? Here's some perspective.

The Congressional Budget Office anticipates that the United States -- the whole United States -- will collect just $46 trillion in taxes over the same period. In other words, Elizabeth Warren's health care plan alone will consume the overwhelming majority of all tax dollars in the United States.

That's before we spend a single dollar on -- I don't know -- Social Security, education, national defense and everything else.

It's demented.

Now, you should know that the Urban Institute has no motive to attack Elizabeth Warren. It's not a right-wing think tank. It's a left-wing think tank. They likely didn't even account for the cost of one's pledge to give free health care to every illegal alien who sneaks into the country.

So who is going to pay for all of this? Well, think of it this way: $3.4 trillion a year -- that's the estimated cost. Divide that by 320 million Americans, and you get more than $10,000 per person -- not per taxpayer, per person. That means every child, every retiree, every prison inmate, everybody.

That would be the largest tax assessed in American history by far. Nothing even comes close. That would change everything. An awful lot of people would just leave the country and not come back.

So how do you pay for ""Medicare-for-all""? It's not a minor detail we can settle later. It's the single most important question about the program. Why do you think we don't have it already? Because we can't afford it.

Elizabeth Warren pretends that's irrelevant -- and to her, maybe it is irrelevant.

At some point in the last couple of years, Warren stopped functioning as a conventional senator and became a kind of Messianic figure. Details, like what things cost or whether something is constitutional or even if the majority of Americans want it, none of that seems to interest Elizabeth Warren any more.

Warren has seen the future, and in that future, she has complete and unquestioned control of America. She is the most powerful person in the world.

You can almost hear her repeating the phrase to herself... ""The most powerful person in the world.""

It's intoxicating, clearly.

BUTTIGIEG, KLOBUCHAR GET BIG POST-DEBATE BOOST

Fox News: “Sen. Amy Klobuchar – giddy after a lack of sleep and rave reviews for her debate performance – touted to the jam-packed crowd inside a café in New Hampshire’s capital city that she raised $1.1 million in the 24 hours after Tuesday’s Democratic presidential nomination showdown. The haul was nearly a quarter of what she brought in during the entire July-September third quarter of fundraising. Highlighting that most of the money was from small-dollar contributions, the Minnesota Democrat told reporters ‘that shows something happened, that people were watching and they responded. And that is a very big deal for us.’ As Klobuchar spotlighted her post-debate haul, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who also excelled during the showdown, reported bringing in $1.1 million in the same 24-hours following the debate. His campaign touted that Wednesday was ‘one of our biggest fundraising days yet.’”



Buttigieg draws heat from black activists over fundraiser - AP: “Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is scheduled to attend a Chicago fundraiser that will be co-hosted by a former city attorney who vigorously tried to block the release of a video depicting the shooting of Laquan McDonald , a black teenager whose death at the hands of police stirred months of protest and resulted in an officer’s conviction. Steve Patton, who led Chicago’s law department under former Mayor Rahm Emanuel, is listed as a sponsor of the Friday event, according to an invitation obtained by The Associated Press. For months, Buttigieg has faced criticism over his own handling of race as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, a racially divided city where decades of simmering racial tension erupted this summer when a white police officer shot and killed an African American man. … ‘He should adjust his schedule,’ said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, when asked about the fundraiser.”



Analysis finds Warren $30 trillion short on single-payer plan - Bloomberg: “Elizabeth Warren took a lot of flak at this week’s Democratic presidential debate for being evasive about the taxes needed to pay for the $30 trillion Medicare for All plan she champions. There’s a reason for being vague: Her team hasn’t yet figured out how to pay for it. ‘Her taxes as they currently exist are not enough yet to cover fully replacing health insurance,’ University of California, Berkeley economics professor Emmanuel Saez, who advised the Warren campaign… Warren -- who campaigns on the theme that she has a plan for everything -- is relying on the wealthy and big corporations to pay for her vision of restructuring American society, including funding student debt, free college, universal childcare, green energy and affordable housing plans. … But she has made the strategic decision to adopt Bernie Sanders’ government-run health care plan rather than develop one of her own. … The Warren campaign said they are continuing to review revenue options to fund Medicare for All…”



Tim Alberta: Watching the Dem debate with Michael Bennet - Politico: “The instincts that guide [Michael] Bennet—being pragmatic, deliberative, restrained—are what many Americans say are precisely what’s needed to run the White House. But now, perhaps more than ever, those instincts are the opposite of what’s needed to win the White House. Once upon a time, there was a limited return on investing in outrage and demagoguery; statesmen were in high demand no matter the supply. That’s no longer the case, and not simply because a celebrity showman named Donald Trump is president of the United States. The painful reality of this political moment slides over Bennet like a barbed-wire blanket as he flops onto the couch and kicks off his faded brown dress shoes, preparing for a three-hour reality-television show that will help determine who leads the free world. All the more irksome to Bennet is the fact that five of his fellow senators are staring back at him from beneath the bright lights; he is the only member of the ‘world’s greatest deliberative body’ seeking a promotion who is excluded from the festivities.”



David Brooks: If it’s Trump vs. Warren, then what? - WaPo: “This is a memo for the politically homeless. It’s a memo to those of us who could never support Donald Trump but think the Bernie-Squad-Warren Democratic Party is sprinting too far left. It’s a memo built around the following question: If the general election campaign turns out to be Trump vs. Warren, what the heck are we supposed to do? The first thing we could do, of course, is pray for a miracle. Maybe the Democrats will nominate one of the five B’s or the K: Biden, Buttigieg, Booker, Bennet, Bullock or Klobuchar. These candidates are pluralists, not purists. … And yet, if it comes to Trump vs. Warren in a general election, the only plausible choice is to support Warren. Over the past month Donald Trump has given us fresh reminders of the unique and exceptional ways he corrupts American life. … Politics is downstream from morality and culture. Warren represents a policy wrong turn, in my view, but policies can be argued about and reversed.”



THE RULEBOOK: BUT STILL PROBLEMATIC

“It is at least problematical, whether the decisions of this body do not, in several instances, misconstrue the limits prescribed for the legislative and executive departments, instead of reducing and limiting them within their constitutional places.” – Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 50



TIME OUT: LE EWW, LE GROSS

AFP: “The Paris zoo's latest attraction is a brainless, eyeless, single-celled organism with no limbs or stomach but more than 700 genders. Meet the ‘blob’, also known by its scientific name Physarum polycephalum or ‘many-headed slime.’ Preceding humans on Earth by some 500 million years, the creature resembles a kind of slippery sponge. It appears stationary, but does cover ground – at a leisurely pace of up to [0.4 inches] per hour – in search of prey, such as mushroom spores, bacteria, and other microbes. From Saturday, members of the public can become better acquainted with ‘le blob’, which has taken up residence in a large tank at the zoo in Paris' Bois de Vincennes park. Named after the 1958 sci-fi horror movie ‘The Blob’ about an alien creature that crashes to Earth and devours residents of Pennsylvania, the real-life blob consists of a single cell, sometimes with many nuclei that can replicate their DNA and divide.”

MULVANEY INCREASES WHITE HOUSE MISERY INDEX

WaPo: “For 39 minutes Thursday, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney turned the press briefing room into a sort of confession chamber, openly admitting to several acts that could deepen the legal predicament for the president. [Donald] Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry into whether he has abused his office for personal and political gain. … In admitting that Trump had personally intervened to award a multimillion-dollar summit to his own company, and that the president had also used taxpayer money as leverage to push a Ukrainian investigation into Democrats, Mulvaney embraced a classic Trumpian tactic: saying the quiet — and potentially illegal — part out loud. But that strategy with regard to Ukraine came in for withering criticism after Mulvaney’s appearance, and he later tried to walk back his comments. In a statement late Thursday, Mulvaney denied the quid pro quo he had previously defended as appropriate and normal.”



State Department official: Obama administration ignored Biden warnings - Fox News: “A State Department official focused on Ukraine policy told Congress this week he raised concerns about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas firm in 2015, but was rebuffed by former Vice President Joe Biden’s staff, Fox News has confirmed. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, who testified behind closed doors before committees spearheading the formal House impeachment inquiry, told congressional investigators that he had qualms about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings. … A congressional source confirmed to Fox News on Friday that Kent testified that when he brought his concerns to the office of the vice president in 2016, his staff ‘blew him off’ and ignored the issue involving the younger Biden's role at the firm.”



Support steady for impeachment probe - Pew Research Center: “The new survey by Pew Research Center … finds that 54% currently approve of the House’s decision to conduct an impeachment inquiry, while 44% disapprove. Neither party engenders a great deal of confidence that they will be ‘fair and reasonable’ during the impeachment inquiry, the survey finds. About four-in-ten (43%) expect that the Republicans in Congress will be fair in handling the inquiry, while slightly more (47%) say the same about the Democrats in Congress. The survey, conducted on Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel, enables us to examine opinions about impeachment among the same group of respondents over the past month.”



Rick Perry announces year-end departure amid increasing scrutiny - NPR: “Secretary of Energy Rick Perry plans to leave his position at the end of the year, President Trump confirmed to reporters Thursday in Fort Worth, Texas. Trump praised Perry and said he already has a replacement in mind. ‘Rick has done a fantastic job,’ Trump said. ‘But it was time.’ Trump said that Perry's resignation didn't come as a surprise and that he has considered leaving for six months because ‘he's got some very big plans.’ Perry, 69, is one of Trump's original Cabinet members and recently has emerged as a central figure in the impeachment inquiry of Trump. Perry was part of what was dubbed ‘the three amigos’ — in addition to Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt Volker, former envoy to Ukraine — charged with managing the U.S.-Ukraine relationship after the White House removed the core of its Ukraine policy team last spring.”



DEMS BUILD CASH CASTELLATION AROUND HOUSE MAJORITY

Politico: “Democrats are building a financial bulwark around their House majority that’s going to be tough for Republicans to breach in 2020. Thirty-three of the 44 most vulnerable House Democrats have stashed an impressive $1 million or more in the bank well before the election year even begins. And their fundraising pace is not slowing down as they gear up to defend the chamber. Federal Election Commission reports filed this week illustrate Democrats’ formidable advantage: The 44 Democrats in the most competitive seats banked a collective $59 million so far. Nearly 30 raised $500,000 or more in the third quarter, according to a POLITICO analysis of the fundraising filings. And all but six of the so-called ‘frontliners’ have at least half a million more banked than their challengers, if they have any challenger at all. … The GOP is struggling to adapt to a changing landscape; They can no longer dismiss the strong fundraising as an anomaly when it has remained steady throughout the first three quarters of 2019.”



Can anyone beat AOC? - NYT: “It is hard to imagine a scenario where Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez loses her seat next year. She has raised more than $3.4 million, is better known than some presidential candidates and handily won a district that is among the bluest in the nation. But that hasn’t stopped people — lots of them — from trying to unseat her. So far, eight Republicans and three Democrats have filed to run for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s seat in the Bronx and Queens. Two of the Republicans have each raised more than $420,000, even though no Republican has represented the Bronx in Congress in at least 50 years. … The campaigns also highlight a broader strategy by the Republican Party: turning voters’ resentment toward Ms. Ocasio-Cortez into a conduit for the party’s other electoral goals.”



POLL SHOWS GARDNER TRAILING HICKENLOOPER

KMGH: “New Colorado polling released Thursday shows that John Hickenlooper leads Sen. Cory Gardner in a theoretical Senate matchup next year by 11 percentage points and that a majority of Coloradans support the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. The Keating Research-OnSight Public Affairs-Martin Campaigns (KOM) survey released Thursday afternoon was conducted by the Democratic pollsters Oct. 10-14 and polled 500 active statewide voters who cast ballots in 2016, 2017 or 2018 or signed up to vote since last November. The poll was weighted to be in line with voter turnout demographics and the margin of error was ±4.4% and was paid for by KOM.”



Former Republican launches Kansas Senate bid as a Democrat - The Wichita [Kan.] Eagle: “A Kansas lawmaker who left the Republican Party last year now hopes to become the first Kansas Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate in decades. State Sen. Barbara Bollier launched her campaign for U.S. Senate on Wednesday by promising an independent approach. She condemned dysfunction in Washington as she seeks to replace retiring Republican Sen. Pat Roberts. … Bollier, of Mission Hills in Johnson County, is the fourth Democrat in the race and the ninth candidate overall – joining a sprawling field that includes Republicans Rep. Roger Marshall and former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. In the Democratic contest, she will have to overcome serious campaigns by former federal prosecutor Barry Grissom and Manhattan Mayor Pro Tem Usha Reddi.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“A small, but important correction. It is not the American Air Force at work in Syria. It is either the American air force or it is the United States Air Force/U.S. Air Force, from which I am retired with 21 years of service. The same goes for the American army or the American navy. I agree with capitalizing proper names, but prefer that it be done properly. I'm a faithful reader, an independent politically, and I appreciate your non-partisan approach. Sometimes it feels as though we who prefer listening, thinking and discussing rationally are but drowning voices in a maelstrom of partisan fury. The Halftime Report is one of the very few media outlets that I feel I can trust to report accurately and to make projections which are supported reasonably. Thank you for the time and effort you and your team put into keeping us informed.” – Dave Riley, Kasilof, Alaska



[Ed. note: Good point, Mr. Riley! Certainly no disrespect intended. I was swerving from overuse of U.S. and ran off the other side of the road. Thank you so much for your kind words, readership and, most of all, your service.]



“Chris, I hope the new Syrian ceasefire lasts longer than your pledge to remain neutral about Trump in your Halftime Report.” – Scott Lyddon, Savannah, Ga.



[Ed. note: I’ve got to give it to you, Mr. Lyddon. That was pretty good! And since the cease fire seems to have ended before it really began, you may be now doubly right from your own perspective. I would remind you though that the goal here isn’t to be “neutral,” but rather to be useful. Fair analysis will necessarily include criticism. If there were no criticism – true neutrality – we would lose the capacity to render necessary judgments. My promise to you, however, is that I do not and will not make judgement about ideological rights and wrongs. As we wrote Thursday, we hold harmless those who either support or oppose the president’s policies in Syria. The same goes for the competing opinions about whether the president should be removed from office for leaning on the Ukrainians to investigate his political foes. Both positions are defensible and substantially irrelevant to my work. Our point Thursday was that however you feel about the policies, Trump’s chaotic governance and indiscipline is creating political liabilities. This week has been a brutal one for the administration, most of it needlessly so. I hope, whatever resentments you may hold for my rejection of neutrality, you still find the analysis useful.]



“As much as I admire moderation in the body politic, it seems that we are rapidly approaching a choice for those of us with (R) on our voting status. I find much of the President's language and combative behavior appalling, however he is generally consistent with my views on policy. But I am APPALLED by the full throated embrace of Socialism that is occurring on the other ‘side of the aisle.’ If we ‘moderate conservatives’ sit this one out (as probably occurred with the evangelical Christians in 2012), I believe the result could be an upheaval of our American way of life, facilitated by the most massive transfer of wealth in history.” – Patsy Fields, Aliso Viejo, Calif.



[Ed. note: Well, I’ve got good news and bad news for you, Ms. Fields. The bad news is that we are indeed already in the midst of an upheaval of American life. The changes we’re seeing in how we live, work, play, worship, mate, learn and communicate are massive in scope. You would have to go back a century or more to find a moment that even comes close to the enormous societal and, consequently, political change that has wracked American society over the past 20 years. No matter how you vote, that toothpaste isn’t going back in the tube. Neither party nor any politician has the answer for dealing with all of these changes. The far left believes economic collectivism based on an ambition for social justice is the answer, while the far right champions a sort of cultural collectivism supported by economic nationalism in which the government works to engineer a new American culture to its supporters liking. Both will probably fail to achieve their highest aims. And that’s the good news. As we have done many times before, the rest of us will just have to figure it out, making it up as we go. It’s going to be bumpy, but I remain confident that it’s going to be great.]

OH, FLOYD

NY Daily News: “A leisurely Sunday afternoon hike on a mountain trail outside of Salt Lake City turned into an animal rescue after Floyd, a 3-year-old, 190-pound Mastiff, decided he was too tired to descend and wouldn’t budge. Around 6:30 p.m. as temperatures were dropping, rescuers were called after other hikers stumbled upon Floyd and his owner. Luckily, the all-volunteer Salt Lake County Sheriff’s Office search and rescue team was able strap Floyd into a stretcher and carry the big fella down to the trailhead without further incident. ‘They had no hesitation whatsoever, even when they heard it was a dog,’ Sgt. Melody Gray of the Unified Police Department, which works with the sheriff’s search and rescue team, told CNN. She added the whole operation lasted about four hours.”

“What’s so remarkable is that constitutions are highly reactionary documents. The very essence of a constitution is to constrain the enthusiasms of a future that one cannot even see.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) in a column from Krauthammer’s posthumous book, “The Point of It All,” published in the Washington Post on Nov. 29, 2018.

The dreaded “Madden” curse has plagued NFL superstars who have been on the cover of the video game for years and Mahomes, the cover star of this year's installment of the video game franchise, appears to be the latest victim.

PATRICK MAHOMES INJURY DRAWS UNSETTLING REACTIONS FROM CHIEFS TEAMMATES: 'IT LOOKED DEFORMED'

Mahomes was coming off an NFL MVP season and 12-4 record as the Chiefs QB in 2018, throwing for a league-leading 50 touchdown passes. Mahomes was having a solid season through six-and-a-half games, leading the NFL with 2,180 passing yards and 15 touchdown passes.

It all came into an end Thursday when it appeared he suffered a devastating knee injury against the Broncos. However, the NFL Network reported that Mahomes suffered a dislocated kneecap and might be able to play through it after three weeks of rest.

It wasn’t the first time the “Madden” curse struck this season.

PATRICK MAHOMES INJURY DAMAGES KANSAS CITY CHIEFS' SUPER BOWL ODDS

NFL fans blamed the jinx for derailing Antonio Brown’s career. He was on the cover of “Madden 19” for last year’s installment of the game. While Brown had a good year for the Pittsburgh Steelers, his rift with teammates led the organization to trade him.

He then suffered a frostbite mishap during the offseason, and ironically enough “Madden 19” used a Frostbite graphics engine to “make you feel like you’re in the game every time you pick up the sticks.” The engine debuted during “Madden 18,” with Tom Brady on the cover.

The ""Madden"" curse has been blamed for the down years and injuries of several superstars, including Rob Gronkowski, who was on the front of the 2017 installment, Michael Vick, Shaun Alexander and Vince Young. The hex’s history can be traced all the way back to 1999 when Barry Sanders was on the cover of “Madden 2000,"" only to abruptly retire."

“If the president ever wants me to go out and take that podium, I will happily do it,” Grisham told “Fox & Friends.”

“As evidenced by yesterday with Mick, it was, again, more theater. It is about people wanting to be on TV and making names for themselves,” Grisham said, adding that Mulvaney ""did a great job.""

FLEISCHER: MICK MULVANEY MADE A 'TERRIBLE MISTAKE' BY CONTRADICTING THE PRESIDENT

Mulvaney seemed to contradict President Trump’s claim that there was no “quid pro quo” during his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky by telling reporters at the White House press conference that the release of military aid to Ukraine was tied to the administration’s demands that Kiev investigate purported corruption by the Democrats during the 2016 presidential election campaign.

MULVANEY COMMENTS SEIZED ON BY CRITICS SAYING IT'S PROOF OF UKRAINE QUID PRO QUO

When questioned by reporters about the administration’s decision to withhold $400 million in aid from Ukraine, Mulvaney said that Trump told him at the time: ""This is a corrupt place. Everyone knows this is a corrupt place ... Plus, I'm not sure that the other European countries are helping them out either.”

Mulvaney added: “Did [Trump] also mention to me, in the past, the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that’s it. And that’s why we held up the money ... The look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. And that is absolutely appropriate.”

Grisham said the media got themselves ""in a tizzy"" so Mulvaney later clarified and said ""there was absolutely no quid pro quo.""

“He was over there for more than 30 minutes. He took probably 40 questions. People were talking over one another. He did a great job. He mentioned the same message over and over and over,” Grisham said.

She said Trump holds many briefings with reporters and ""there's no better spokesman,"" lessening the need for the daily sessions held by her predecessors Sarah Sanders and Sean Spicer.

In a new interview, Clinton appeared to float a conspiracy theory that the Russians are “grooming” Hawaii congresswoman and Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard to be a third-party candidate in 2020.

“I'm not making any predictions, but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,” Clinton said, an apparent reference to Gabbard. “She's the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.”

She then accused Stein, who ran against her and Donald Trump in 2016, of also being an asset of Russia: ""That’s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she’s also a Russian asset. I mean -- totally.""

GABBARD DARES CLINTON TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020, FIGHTS BACK AGAINST ASSERTIONS THAT SHE'S A RUSSIAN ASSET

Stein shot back on Friday, challenging Clinton to a one-on-one debate.

""In light of the latest slanderous allegations from @HillaryClinton, I challenge her to a debate. It's past time to give the American people the real debate they deserved in 2016, but were denied by the phony DNC/RNC-controlled Commission on Presidential Debates,"" Stein wrote in a series of tweets. ""It's a shame HRC is peddling conspiracy theories to justify her failure instead of reflecting on real reasons Dems lost in 2016. You can slander progressives as 'Russian assets,' but you can't hide the fact that the DNC sabotaged Sanders & elevated Trump to set the stage for HRC.""

She continued: ""HRC's rant is Exhibit A for how the establishment is using the new Cold War to crack down on dissent & feed the war machine. Instead of addressing the crises working people face, they're painting progressives as the enemy. It's as if they're trying to lose to Trump again.""

Gabbard also had a fiery response to Clinton and dared the former Secretary of State to enter the 2020 race.

""Great! Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain,"" Gabbard wrote in a three-part tweet on Friday. ""From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a concerted campaign to destroy my reputation.""

""We wondered who was behind it and why,"" Gabbard continued in her tweeted answer to Clinton. ""Now we know — it was always you, through your proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose. It’s now clear that this primary is between you and me.

""Don’t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly"" she said in a taunt squarely aimed at Dems' 2016 standard-bearer.

Bernie Sanders of Vermont proudly calls himself a democratic socialist. But fellow Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts – who holds many similar extreme-leftist positions – claims she’s really a capitalist.

That’s a claim that would add a few feet to Pinocchio’s nose.

Warren can call herself anything she wants. She falsely called herself a Native American for years and finally had to apologize for that instance of mislabeling. But if truth in packaging laws applied to politicians, Warren would have to admit she’s no more a capitalist than she is a Native American.

CHARLES PAYNE: ELIZABETH WARREN WANTS TO BREAK APART AN ECONOMY THAT'S WORKING

With her long record of promoting socialist causes and her calls for massive new job-killing government regulations and huge tax increases – on income, wealth, and whatever she can think of to take money from hard-working individuals and businesses – Warren is as much of a socialist as Sanders.

While their views aren’t are identical, the true ideological colors of Comrade Bernie and Comrade Elizabeth are both shades of red.

In the wake of Sanders’ recent heart attack, Warren appears better positioned than ever to become the Democratic Party’s 2020 presidential nominee.

Real Clear Politics’ average of recent presidential surveys shows Warren is now polling eight percentage points higher than Sanders. And in two national surveys – one by The Economist and another by Quinnipiac – Warren is polling higher than the longstanding front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden.

Although Biden has been considered a lock to win the nomination by some analysts for months, it seems unlikely he will be able to compete with a far-left challenger like Warren or Sanders once the race inevitably narrows.

Although Biden is unquestionably a progressive whose policies would cause substantial damage to the U.S., he’s not a radical who wants to dynamite the capitalist system that has made America the most prosperous and powerful nation on the planet. But that’s exactly what Warren and Sanders want to do.

It doesn’t help that Biden’s TV debate performances have made the former vice president look more than a little confused. At times, it appears Biden isn’t sure where he is or what year it is – never mind what the candidates are debating.

Warren is a different story entirely. Her debate performances have been sharp and, at times, impressive – though she sometimes sounds like a nagging schoolteacher berating her young students.

Why, exactly, hasn’t Warren been labeled a “socialist”? The biggest – and perhaps the only – reason is that she and others in her party and the left-leaning media continue to insist she isn’t one, despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary.

For example, in an Oct. 13 interview with ABC News’s “This Week,” Sanders said: “There are differences between Elizabeth and myself. Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.”

Like many of the things oozing from Comrade Bernie’s mouth, this, too, is false. Warren is a socialist through and through and her dangerous, destructive policy plans would – like all socialist proposals – cause substantial harm to America’s economy and society, hurting everyone, including the most impoverished.

Warren understands that if she says she’s a socialist, she’ll lose support from moderate voters whose support she would need in the general election to defeat President Trump. So she pretends she’s not what she really is.

Here are just some of Warren’s many frightening socialist plans for the United States:

Warren has endorsed the “Just Society” proposal of socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. This radical idea would – among other things – redefine poverty in the United States so that potentially tens of millions of additional Americans will be pushed onto social welfare programs like Medicaid. A “Just Society” would also make it illegal to deny illegal immigrants and those who have been convicted of crimes access to welfare programs.

Warren has proposed what she calls The Accountable Capitalism Act. This would force every corporation in America with $1 billion or more in annual revenue to obtain a federal charter from a new regulatory agency. The legislation would require that at least 40 percent of corporate board member be elected by workers, and impose costly new bureaucratic regulations on companies. This would likely cause a mass exodus of the most important businesses from the U.S. – stunting economic growth, sending unemployment skyrocketing, and increasing the national debt

Warren has also proposed imposing a single-payer health care system. This would outlaw most forms of private health insurance and force the more than 140 million Americans now enrolled in private insurance plans onto government-managed health plans – all at a cost of $32 trillion over 10 years. Single-payer models elsewhere in the world require very high taxes and have led to rationing of health care and long wait times. This rationing increases unnecessary pain and suffering for millions of people and in the most extreme cases can lead to some patient deaths.

Warren also wants to spend $500 billion over 10 years to build millions of new housing units, and trillions of dollars to cancel college student loan debt for 42 million Americans. She would also “give every American the opportunity to attend a two-year or four-year public college without paying a dime in tuition or fees.”

Warren, like Sanders, was one of the original cosponsors of Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal. This is the most radical, dangerous, environmentally destructive proposal in modern American history. The Green New Deal would destroy millions of jobs by eliminating most forms of fossil fuel generation and use, including that gasoline-powered vehicle you drive to work every day. It would also create a new system of publicly-owned banks, basic income programs, a federal jobs guarantee, massive new green housing mandates, a universal health food program, and countless new “social justice” programs.

These proposals – and the incredibly high tax increases needed to fund them – would push the U.S. closer than ever to full-blown Marxism, and they are without any doubt in line with socialist principles. This is why self-described socialists like Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez have embraced or even proposed the vast majority of them.

With Halloween just around the corner, millions of children will be dressing up for one night pretending to be all sorts of characters. Warren has stopped pretending to be a Native American, but pretends every day to be a capitalist – while she knows very well that she’s a socialist through and through.

For the sake of our country and the American people, let’s hope voters see through Warren’s masquerade.

""If they can falsely portray me as a traitor, then they can do it to anyone -- and in fact, that's exactly the message they want to get across to you,"" Gabbard, a Democrat, said in the video.

""If you stand up to Hillary and the party power brokers -- if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message. But, here is the truth: They will not intimidate us. They will not silence us.""

WATCH: GABBARD TALKS TO 'TUCKER' ABOUT CLINTON'S REMARKS

The post ratcheted up an already escalating feud that has rocked the presidential primary. Several candidates, including Beto O'Rourke, Andrew Yang and Marianne Williamson, have criticized Clinton's unfounded suggestion that Russians have been ""grooming"" Gabbard to be a third-party spoiler in the race.

Gabbard, D-Hawaii, started the video by referencing her time as the vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) from 2013 to 2016 -- before she quit and threw her support behind Bernie Sanders. At the time, Gabbard accused party leaders of stifling her freedom of speech and unfairly tipping the scales in favor of eventual nominee Hillary Clinton.

""People warned me in 2016 that my endorsement of Bernie Sanders would be the end of my 'political career' -- they said Clinton would never forget,"" Gabbard said in the video, ""that she and her rich and powerful friends -- her allies in politics and the media -- will make sure you're destroyed.""

Gabbard asserted that ""countless hit pieces full of smears"" have been published in an effort to ""destroy"" her reputation, which included years of military and congressional service.

DAVID BOSSIE: HILLARY CLINTON, HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW (HINT: TULSI GABBARD HAS A SOLUTION)

At last week's New York Times-CNN primary debate, Gabbard specifically called out the Times and CNN for waging what she called a propaganda campaign against her, while also promoting endless ""regime-change"" wars.

""The New York Times and CNN have smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime-change war,"" Gabbard said. ""Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist, and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.""

Clinton herself, meanwhile, has come under scrutiny for raising money secretly from Russians when she was secretary of state. ""Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal,"" read a 2015 headline in the Times.

CNN political commentator Van Jones echoed Gabbard's argument on-air, and called out Clinton's ""disinformation"" -- saying ""she just came out against a sitting U.S. congresswoman, a decorated war veteran, and someone who's running for the nomination of our party, with just a complete smear and no facts.""

Jones continued: ""This is a very, very dangerous game -- and there's a backstory here. Let's not forget: Tulsi Gabbard was picked out by the Democratic Party establishment and put at the top of the DNC, and they thought she was going to be their golden girl. And, she got in that position in the DNC, and she looked around, and she saw [then-DNC Chairwoman] Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and other people, Clinton allies, doing stuff they shouldn't have been doing in the primary.

""And, Tulsi publicly quit, and then endorsed Bernie Sanders, and it's been payback hell ever since,"" Jones said.

The brouhaha began in a podcast with former Obama adviser David Plouffe, when Clinton said she wasn't ""making any predictions, but [she thinks Russians] have got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate.""

""She's the favorite of the Russians"" she added, saying they ""have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.""

Clinton described 2016 Green Party candidate Jill Stein as a “Russian asset,"" but didn't explicitly name Gabbard. Then, when Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill was asked if Clinton was referring to Gabbard, he responded: “If the nesting doll fits …”

That prompted Gabbard to respond forcefully to Clinton on Twitter Friday, calling her the ""queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party!""

Gabbard, speaking to Fox News' ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" accused Clinton of targeting her for her anti-war and anti-establishment views. Gabbard has dared Clinton to enter the race, rather than hide behind ""proxies.""

In response, several journalists and analysts openly sided with Clinton -- with The Week declaring Gabbard's comments ""outrageous.""

Two MSNBC panelists even asserted that Gabbard somehow had outed herself as a ""Russian asset"" by responding to Clinton's accusations at all.

""One thing that was interesting about Tulsi Gabbard's response, I mean she went after Hillary Clinton strong, she said she wasn't going to run as a third-party candidate, she never denied being a Russian asset,"" WBUR's Kimberly Atkins said on ""MSNBC Live.""

Atkins continued: ""That was the one aspect that was missing from her response, which you think that would be in the first line or two. It was not there.""

Overlooking the fact that Clinton's spokesperson signaled that Clinton was referring directly to Gabbard, analyst Jonathan Allen responded: ""When Hillary Clinton says there's a Russian asset, doesn't say anybody's name, and Tulsi Gabbard goes, 'How dare you call me a Russian asset?' I mean, you know. ...""

Anchor Jonathan Capehart then excitedly interjected to argue that Gabbard had indeed admitted she was a secret Russian asset, and essentially raised her hand to say, ""Me! Me!"" even though Clinton didn't explicitly ""name names."""

All told, the Ukraine company paid $3.4 million to Rosemont Seneca Bohai LLC, a company headed by Hunter Biden business partner Devon Archer, The National Review reported.

HUNTER BIDEN'S QUESTIONABLE PAST AND BUSINESS DEALINGS COULD UNDO DAD'S BID FOR WHITE HOUSE

Burisma Holdings founder Mykola Zlochevsky hired the son of former Vice President Joe Biden to ""protect"" the company in the face of prosecution, the Review reported.

Zlochevsky faced investigation in Ukraine and was initially cleared of wrongdoing for tax violations, money laundering and corruption. But earlier this month Ukrainian Prosecutor General Ruslan Ryaboshapka said 15 cases involving Zlochevsky would be reviewed, according to The National Review.

Biden’s work with the company has come under scrutiny after President Trump alleged that Joe Biden inappropriately used his diplomatic influence in Ukraine to help his son.

No evidence of wrongdoing has been found and both Joe Biden and Hunter Biden deny the allegations. Hunter Biden has since pledged to avoid business deals with foreign entities if his father becomes president.

A July phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- in which Trump asked his counterpart to investigate the Bidens -- led the Democrat-controlled House to start the Trump impeachment inquiry earlier this month.

Third-quarter filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) show Biden has just $9 million in cash on hand, less than half of what both of his top competitors for the 2020 Democratic nomination -- Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. -- reported, according to The Hill.

DONNA BRAZILE: BIDEN CAMPAIGN 'NEEDS TO BE CONCERNED' ABOUT CASH WOES

“I hate to say it, but our opponents are way ahead of us when it comes to money in the bank,” a campaign fundraising email for Biden said. “If we don’t pick up the pace here, we might have to make budget cuts that could seriously hurt our momentum in this primary.”

Less cash on hand means the campaign will struggle to respond to “twists and turns of this race — and with Donald Trump constantly pushing his false smear campaign against Joe, that’s a HUGE problem,” the letter says.

The letter closes with an appeal, according to The Hill.

“We can’t afford to fall behind, so I’m asking you to step up now and make a donation to fuel our campaign.""

Democratic operative Michael Ceraso said Biden's cash flow could dry up ""as the primary enters the homestretch, which may prevent the VP from competing and challenging his opponents in Super Tuesday states and beyond.""

Biden is spending money at a greater rate than the amount he raised, with a burn rate of 112 percent. Warren’s burn rate - the pace at which candidates are spending their campaign cash – was a much more modest 76 percent.

The 76-year-old former vice president started off as a solid frontrunner in the polls, but more recent surveys have shown Warren either catching up or surpassing him.

""I think that we have a chance to build an American majority around bold action, but it is the case that we could wreck that majority through purity tests,"" Buttigieg said. ""Take the example of this Medicare question. I’m proposing Medicare for all who want it. It means we create a version of Medicare, everybody can get access to it, and if you want to keep your private plan we’re okay with that.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is an independent agency of the U.S. government, responsible for consumer protection in the financial sector. It was created by Congress in 2010 to be an autonomous entity, structured so each director serves a five-year term and can only be removed for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”

MICHAEL MOORE ENDORSES BERNIE SANDERS: 'HE ISN'T AFRAID TO SAY CAPITALISM IS THE PROBLEM'

Warren, D-Mass., touted on the campaign trail that the bureau returned $12 billion to consumers during the Obama administration, The Washington Post reported. She uses the figure to push a presidential platform based on attacking corporate greed and increasing taxes on wealthy Americans.

“Big banks and their Republican allies have been trying to kill the CFPB for years, and the Trump administration is hoping the right-wing, pro-corporate Supreme Court will help. I’ve got news for them: Like it or not, the CFPB is constitutional,” Warren said on Twitter.

An attorney for the Trump administration told the Supreme Court in a brief last month that even the bureau’s current director, Kathleen Kraninger, who was sworn in in 2018, believes the structure of the CFPB violates the separation of powers clause of the Constitution given its director cannot be fired by the president without sufficient cause.

Critics of the bureau say the Constitution gives the president the power to remove top-ranking executive branch officials for any reason or none at all. They say the founders were wary of power being entrusted to any one individual who had not been elected into office, the Washington Times reported.

The Supreme Court “has consistently recognized that the Constitution empowers the president to keep federal officers accountable by removing them from office,” Washington lawyer Kannon K. Shanmugam wrote in the brief, according to The Washington Post.

“While in limited circumstances the court has upheld the constitutionality of certain multi-member ‘independent’ agencies ... the court has never upheld the constitutionality of an independent agency that exercises significant executive authority and is headed by a single person.”

Republicans and banking executives have opposed the bureau since its inception, arguing it often pushing legal margins to slap unnecessary penalties on financial intuitions. White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney once described the bureau as “a joke” and supported legislation to disband it, the Post reported.

Lower court ruling on the constitutionality of the bureau have been conflicting.

It was former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel who famously said, “You never want to let a serious crisis go to waste. What I mean by that is it gives you an opportunity to do things that you could not do before.”

The tactic has been linked to Saul Alinsky, the radical Chicago community organizer of whom former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential contender Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., are disciples.

CALIFORNIA SALON OWNER BLASTS GOV. NEWSOM OVER HOMELESS CRISIS: HE'S MORE CONCERNED WITH 'TROLLING' TRUMP

In November 2018, California voters defeated a statewide ballot initiative that would have extended rent control statewide. It was soundly rejected by an almost 20-point margin. Every county in the state except for San Francisco voted it down.

Even the Democrat running for governor, Gavin Newsom, indicated his opposition to the initiative. But now that he's in office, the former lieutenant governor and former mayor of San Francisco has changed his position, insisting the state must respond to the homeless problem.

Last week we learned of at least one of the actions the governor plans to take. Newsom signed a statewide rent-control law, overturning the will of the people. He followed the progressive playbook by using the homeless crisis “to do things that you could not do before.”

Progressives assert that the homeless crisis is due in large part to a housing shortage, and that the best way to address the shortage is with rent control. The new law also protects tenants from eviction without good reason and provides compensation to tenants if they are evicted due to renovation.

“The housing crisis is reaching every corner of America, where you’re seeing high home prices, high rents, evictions and homelessness that we’re all struggling to grapple with,” said Assemblyman David Chiu, a San Francisco Democrat who authored the bill. “Protecting tenants is a critical and obvious component of any strategy to address this.”

It may be “obvious” to some, but any scratching of the surface of California's rent law shows it to be utterly useless.

First, the law ignores the fact that the state's epicenters of homelessness, Los Angeles and San Francisco, already have rent control on the books that's even more stringent than what just passed.

In San Francisco, studies show the caps have sharply decreased the supply of rental housing, driving up rents citywide by 5 percent. That's because landlords demolished properties and built pricey new ones to avoid the caps.

If rent control helps reduce homelessness, why is the problem so prevalent in the very cities that already have it? And how is extending it to the rest of the state supposed to address the issue?

Rent control has been a proven failure in addressing housing problems. It prompts landlords to convert their properties into owner-occupied homes, and deters investment in the housing market, aggravating the shortages that caused them in the first place.

The truth the left would prefer you not to know: The homeless problem has little to do with lack of affordable housing. There is plenty of affordable housing in California outside major cities. For instance, next to Los Angeles County is Riverside, where the average rent is $1,525 per month, close to the national average of about $1,400.

Not everyone can afford to live exactly where they want to live. Most Californians understand this.

What politicians must acknowledge is that the real cause of most homelessness is the prevalence of mental illness and substance abuse in the homeless community. According to a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development report, 45 percent of homeless people suffer from mental illness. A University of Pennsylvania report, found that about half suffer from alcohol or drug dependence.

In addition, a U.S. Conference of Mayors report in 2014 revealed that only 18 percent of the homeless are employed. That means that for most, the cost of housing doesn't really matter. They simply can't afford it.

Rent control has been a proven failure in addressing housing problems. It prompts landlords to convert their properties into owner-occupied homes, and deters investment in the housing market, aggravating the shortages that caused them in the first place.

Further, when landlords are limited in their ability to raise rents and cannot freely evict tenants, they will be extremely careful in who they rent to. That has a significant adverse effect on the ability of low-income people to find rental housing. Europe has had such limitations for years, and it's notoriously difficult to qualify for a rental property there.

Europe similarly requires “good cause” before terminating an employee; the thinking being that this will result in fewer layoffs and thus lower unemployment. In fact, it has the opposite effect. The harder it is to fire someone, the more cautious employers are in hiring.

The same concept applies to housing.

Addressing homelessness with a statewide rent-control law highlights why California’s homeless problem has gotten so bad.

State politicians would rather use the crisis to pass pet progressive policies rather than address root causes with real solutions. One can only imagine what progressive “solution” is coming next.

Perhaps a $1,000-a-month “freedom dividend” for the homeless?

All, right now on ""FOX News Sunday.""

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: And hello again from FOX News in Washington.

We begin with breaking news. President Trump announced by tweet last night he's backing off his controversial decision to hold the G7 Summit next year at his own resort. He says the search will now begin for a new site.

But the president is still under fire even from a growing number of Republicans. GOP congressmen voted by more than 2-1 against his policy in Syria. White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said the president at a political quid pro quo from USA to Ukraine. Mulvaney later denied he said it, and more damaging testimony in the House impeachment investigation.

In a moment we will talk with the president chief of staff who just flinched when I said that.

But, first, let's bring in Kevin Corke with the latest from the White House -- Kevin.

KEVIN CORKE, CORRESPONDENT: Chris, a precarious pause perhaps describes the tenuous nature of the circumstance on the ground in Syria as sporadic skirmishes continue to speckle the region, even as we learn much more about the U.S. strategy for American forces there.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MARK ESPER, DEFENSE SECRETARY: The current game plan is for those forces to reposition into western Iraq, the ones coming out, right? That original 1,000. And then two missions -- one is to help defend Iraq and two is to perform a counter-ISIS mission.

Back in Washington, the impeachment drumbeat reached a fevered pitch as House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff interviewed a cascade of Trump administration officials but Ukraine and a possible quid pro quo tying USA aid to cooperation with a probe into the Biden's business dealings.

Incredibly, the gulf between House Democrats and the White House seem to grow, when Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi stormed out of a White House meeting, accusing the president of having a meltdown over a bipartisan House vote rebuking his pullout in Syria. All as the president late Saturday rescinded his decision to host next year's G7 Summit at his resort in Miami, tweeting: Based on both media and Democrat crazed and irrational hostility, we will no longer consider Trump National Doral Miami -- a reversal that came after withering criticism and accusations of self- dealing.

Can you at least understand and acknowledge that the -- just the appearance of impropriety makes us wince inducing and maybe this is something you maybe want to reconsider?

MULVANEY: He got over that a long time ago. We absolutely believe this is the best place to have it and we are going to have it there.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

CORKE: That was then, this is now. By the way, in that tweet, Chris, the president mentioned Camp David as a possible location for next year's G7 summit. It last hosted the G8 back in 2012 -- Chris.

WALLACE: Kevin Corke, reporting from the White House, Kevin, thanks from that.

Joining us now for an exclusive interview, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.

Mick, welcome back to ""FOX News Sunday"".

MULVANEY: Good morning.

Yes, I flinched a little bit because that's what people are saying that I said, but I didn't say that. But I'm looking forward to the conversation.

WALLACE: All right. Let's have a conversation.

MULVANEY: Yes.

WALLACE: Why -- here's my first question. Why did you say that in that briefing that President Trump had ordered a quid po qro (ph) -- quid pro quo, that investigating the Democrats, that aid to Ukraine depended on investigating the Democrats? Why did you say that?

MULVANEY: Again, that's not what I said. That's what people said I said.

Here's what I said, I'll say it again and hopefully people will listen this time.

There were two reasons that we held up the aid. We talked about this at some length. The first one was the rampant corruption in Ukraine. Ukraine -- by the way, Chris, it's so bad in Ukraine that in 2014, Congress passed a law making it -- making us -- requiring us to make sure that corruption was moving in the right direction. So, corruption is a big deal, everyone knows it.

The president was also concerned about whether or not other nations, specifically European nations, were helping with foreign aid to the Ukraine as well. We talked about that for quite a while now.

I did then mention that in the past, the president had mentioned for me to time to time about the DNC server. He had mentioned the DNC server to other people publicly. He even mentioned it to President Zelensky in the phone call, but it wasn't connected to the aid. And that's where I think people got sidetracked this weekend at that press conference.

WALLACE: But --

MULVANEY: Two reasons for holding back the aid --

WALLACE: Let me pursue that, though --

MULVANEY: Sure.

WALLACE: -- because I believe that anyone listening to what you said in that briefing could come to only one conclusion. Let's play what you said.

MULVANEY: Sure.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MULVANEY: Did he also mention to me in the past that the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely, no question about that. But that's it, and that's what we held up the money.

REPORTER: What you just described is a quid pro quo. It is, funding will not flow unless the investigation into the -- into the Democrats' server happened as well.

MULVANEY: We do -- we do that all the time with foreign policy.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: You were asked specifically by Jonathan Karl, was investigating Democrats one of the conditions for holding up the aide?

MULVANEY: Yes.

WALLACE: Was that part of the quid pro quo? And you said, it happens all the time.

MULVANEY: Yes. But go back and watch what I said before that. I don't know if you guys can cue it or not. There was a long answer about corruption and a long answer about foreign aid.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: No, you totally said that.

MULVANEY: Just like I told you then, and then I said the exact same thing I just said now, which is that he mentioned in passing yes, but the reason that we held back the aid with the two reasons I mentioned. And I can prove it to you. The aid flowed.

Once we were able to satisfy ourselves that corruption was actually -- they were doing better with it, we got that information from our folks from the conversation with Minister (ph) Zelensky and once we were able to establish we had the Office of Management and Budget do research on other countries' aid to Ukraine, it turns out they don't get any lethal aid, but they do give a considerable sum of money and nonlethal aid.

Once those two things were cleared, the money flowed. There was never any connection between the flow of money and the server.

WALLACE: But, Mick, you know, I hate to go through this, but you said what you said.

MULVANEY: Yes.

WALLACE: And the fact is, after that exchange with Jonathan Karl, you were asked another time why the aide was held up. What was the condition for the aid? And you didn't mention two conditions, you mentioned three conditions.

And I want to -- and let's listen to all three of them because this -- you stated it very clearly. Let's listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MULVANEY: Three issues for that. The corruption in the country, whether or not other countries were participating in support of the Ukraine, and whether or not they were cooperating in an ongoing investigation with our Department of Justice. That's completely legitimate.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Not only did you say that investigating the Democrats was one of the three conditions, not two, that you would just said that you would talk about, investigating the Democrats was part of the quid pro quo. You also said, if I may, it was part of the Justice Department investigation into the origins of the Russia probe.

But the fact is that not only did the press think you said it, here's what a statement that was put out by a senior Justice Department official: If the White House was withholding aid in regards to the cooperation of any investigation at the Department of Justice, that is news to us.

Everybody thinks that that's what you said and you didn't. You said right there --

MULVANEY: Right.

WALLACE: -- three points, not two.

MULVANEY: Well, and a couple different things. You again said just a few seconds ago that I said there was a quid pro quo. I never used that language, because there is not a quid pro quo, but --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: You were asked by Jonathan Karl, is -- you described a quid pro quo, and you said, that happens all the time.

MULVANEY: Well -- and reporters will use their language all the time. So, my language never said quid pro quo.

But let's get to the heart of the matter. Go back and look at that list of three things. What was I talking about? Things that was legitimate for the president to do.

Number one, it is legitimate for the president to want to know what's going on with the ongoing investigation into the server. Everybody acknowledges that -- at least I think most normal people do. It's completely legitimate to ask about that.

Number two, it's legitimate to tie the aid to corruption. It's legitimate to tie the aid to foreign aid from other countries. That's what I was talking about with the three.

Can I see how people took at the wrong way? Absolutely. But I never said there were was quid pro quo, because there isn't.

Again, Chris, you've been in these -- in these briefings. You know how back-and-forth is. You know how rapid-fire it is. Look to the facts on the ground, things that you can actually sort of certify.

And what should put this issue to bed is that the money flowed without any connection whatsoever to the DNC server.

WALLACE: But you -- in your first answer which I gave, you said that's why we held up the money. First, you just said here, that it was for two reasons. Now, you're acknowledging it was for three reasons.

If you held up the money for three reasons, that was -- that's a quid pro quo.

MULVANEY: I am not --

WALLACE: You got to satisfy us on those. Now, maybe the president backed off that, but that was the proposition here.

MULVANEY: I'm not acknowledging there's three reasons. Again, let's go back --

WALLACE: You said three reasons.

MULVANEY: Go back -- I recognize that. Go back to what actually happened in the real world.

And, by the way, go to the phone call, go to the phone call, which we've released. I hope you get a chance to talk about that before the --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: I am going to right now.

MULVANEY: You go to the phone call, the president never mentions the aid at all in the phone call. Doesn't say, oh, by the way, I need you to do this, this, this and this or else the money won't flow.

We all know enough about this president that if he feels very strongly about something, he's going to put that out there directly and that didn't happen.

I recognize that folks -- that I didn't speak clearly maybe on Thursday, folks misinterpreted what I said, but the facts are absolutely clear and they are there for everyone to see.

WALLACE: In the briefing you flatly denied any connection between holding up the aide and investigating Joe Biden and his son, right?

MULVANEY: Correct.

WALLACE: OK. In his phone call with President Zelensky, however, President Trump specifically mentions the Bidens. Do me a favor. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani pushed all summer for Ukraine to announce it was investigating Burisma, the company that paid Hunter Biden.

And a former NSC official testified this week before Congress, John Bolton was so disturbed by the way you are directing people to work with Rudy Giuliani, he said, quote, I am not part of whatever drug deal -- he was speaking metaphorically --

MULVANEY: Right.

WALLACE: -- of whatever drug deal Sondland, the U.S. diplomat, and Mulvaney are cooking up.

No question you are following the president's orders, but your fingerprints are all over linking aid to Ukraine with investigating the Bidens.

MULVANEY: OK. No, that's not true. Let's go -- I'll take one of those of the time which is the Bolton thing, because I read that and I was surprised, because John Bolton never complained to me about it. No one at NSC ever complained to me about anything that was going on.

I didn't see Sondland's testimony this week because none of us have seen Sondland's testimony, which is another story entirely. I did get a chance to read his opening statement when he said that Bolton never complained to him. Fiona Hill never got a chance to complain to him.

I think you need to put sort of --

WALLACE: Wait a minute. Fiona Hill is the one who testified. That's the quote came from her.

MULVANEY: Who never complained to Sondland about what was happening, when it was happening.

WALLACE: No, she complained to her boss, John Bolton.

MULVANEY: Who did what?

WALLACE: Who said -- who told her to go immediately to a lawyer --

MULVANEY: Right.

WALLACE: -- at NSC and to complain about it.

MULVANEY: Who works for John Bolton. Yet John Bolton didn't go say anything to anybody. Doesn't that raise a red flag?

But let's go back to the first thing you talk about, which is the president's phone call, because at the end of the day, that's what this is really about, right? That's why we are here was the president phone call with Ukraine.

And you've done the same thing, and I don't blame you personally. Done the same thing with many news outlets have done. You said, do me a favor and then immediately to the Bidens.

Go look at the transcript of the phone conversation.

WALLACE: I have.

MULVANEY: It's, do me a favor, take a look at the DNC server. Then he talks about corruption in the Ukraine. He talks about Rudy Giuliani.

The president of the Ukraine gets on and he talks about a close cooperation between the countries. He talks about corruption. He talks about getting a new ambassador to the U.S.

And the president gets on and talks about Bill Barr. The president talks about a new ambassador between our countries, and then the very end of that passage mentions the Bidens.

Everybody else puts it on TV and says, do me a favor, look at the Bidens. And that's simply not factually accurate.

Go look at the transcript yourself.

WALLACE: Let's turn to Syria. Defense Secretary Esper overnight has said that those thousand troops who are being moved out of Syria are moving to Iraq. They are not as the president claimed coming home.

MULVANEY: Well, they will eventually. I think --

WALLACE: Eventually?

MULVANEY: The quickest way to get them out of danger was to get them into Iraq. Keep in mind what you are facing here. And I think literally the number was 28. You had 28 U.S. Special Forces between tens of thousands of soldiers on one side and tens of thousands of soldiers on the other side.

And I hope that when we release the letter this week, it put -- it put to the bed this nonsense about how the president supposedly green-lighted this invasion. Nothing would be further from the truth and I think the letter made that painfully clear.

WALLACE: No, no, the letter has been released.

MULVANEY: It has been, but I hope now people realize and -- it was -- listen, this is what we deal with this administration all the time. Whether it's on the impeachment or it's on the Ukraine or -- excuse me, on Syria, is people (ph) say, oh, there's a green light. The president green- lighted this and that's what the press reports.

And then we put out facts that absolutely put that to bed and no one comes back and says, well, we were wrong about that.

Go back to the beginning of the impeachment, how did that start, oh, there were supposedly a transcript with eight references to the Bidens and a quid pro quo on foreign aid -- absolutely false. No one ever went back and said, we were wrong about that either.

WALLACE: OK.

MULVANEY: So --

WALLACE: I do -- I'm running out of time and I do have several more questions.

MULVANEY: Lots of things to talk about.

WALLACE: Yes, we do.

I just want to go back to the briefing for one minute. After the briefing and all the blowback and the criticism, did you ever offer or think to offer the president your resignation?

MULVANEY: No, absolutely not.

WALLACE: Was that ever discussed?

MULVANEY: Absolutely, positively not.

WALLACE: OK.

MULVANEY: No, I'm -- listen, I'm very happy working there. Did I have the perfect press conference? No. But again, the facts were on our side.

I didn't get a chance to talk about some of the stuff I wanted to talk about at that press conference, which was, for example, Senator Menendez sending a letter to the Ukraine saying, if you don't cooperate with Mueller, there will be repercussions for you. I haven't had a chance to talk about -- talk about a quid pro quo, Joe Biden admitting that he said he was going to cut off funding unless the prosecutor got fired. If that's not a quid pro quo, I don't know what it is.

So, I haven't a chance at the presser to do everything I wanted to, but I still think I'm doing a pretty good job as the chief of staff and I think the president agrees.

WALLACE: There seems to be a growing number of Republicans in Congress who are -- if not breaking with the president, distancing themselves from the president.

You had Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader who wrote a scathing article about Syria this week. I'm going to put up one of these quotes.

Withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria is a grave strategic mistake and a strategic nightmare for our country.

House Republicans voted against the Trump policy in Syria 129-60, more than 2-1.

And I talked to a very well-connected Republican in Washington this week, somebody whose name you would know well, who says that if the House votes to impeach and it gets to a trial in the Senate, there is now a 20 percent chance he believes -- obviously, it's just an estimate -- now a 20 percent chance enough Republicans will vote with the Democrats to remove the president.

MULVANEY: Oh, that's just absurd. But let's deal with the issue of Syria.

WALLACE: No, let's deal with the issue of whether Republicans -- you're losing your support.

MULVANEY: Same thing. This comment about a 20 percent chance, the person clearly doesn't know what they're talking about.

But talk about the reaction of the Republicans and Democrats up on the Hill to the decision in Syria, president knew that was going to happen. He recognizes the fact that it's not a politically popular in this town to make the decision that he made to move the troops out of Syria. He ran on it. He told people he would do this if he won and he's doing it now because he won.

WALLACE: Forgive me for interrupting, we are running out of time, I just want to ask you, though -- is there any concern that the president is losing those support of Republicans in Congress?

MULVANEY: No, the president is extraordinary popular back home, more popular in the swing districts now that impeachment has started.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: I'm talking about here in Washington.

MULVANEY: Yes, but they -- they have to go home eventually as well. So, no.

Do I have to understand that there are certain folks, especially the neoconservative wing of the party who are upset about the Syria decision? I absolutely do. The president knew that was going to happen.

Again, elections have consequences on foreign policy. That's where we started this conversation and that thankfully they do.

WALLACE: Two final questions. One, a -- one of the people who was testifying in Congress this week in the House impeachment investigation also said that he was so concerned about Hunter Biden getting that job in Ukraine in 2015 that he went to the vice president staff, Biden was then vice president, and said, this looks really bad. And that he was turned away.

Your reaction?

MULVANEY: Good. I'm surprised I haven't heard about it since. My guess is if it happened (ph) during the Trump administration, the news media would have reported on it at very next day.

WALLACE: I'm asking you about it, sir.

MULVANEY: I know you are. And I appreciate that. I'm hearing about it for the first time, I look forward to finding out more about it. It's the first I've heard of that piece of information.

WALLACE: You had not heard -- it's been reported widely in the last 48 hours.

MULVANEY: No, I've been busy in the last 48 hours, Chris.

WALLACE: OK. Well, let me ask you of something else, maybe you don't know this.

MULVANEY: Yes.

WALLACE: But President Trump has decided after he put you out there in that briefing --

MULVANEY: Yes.

WALLACE: -- to announce Doral -- he is back -- he's decided that he's not going to hold it at Doral. He blames it on, quote, the hostile media and their Democratic partners.

But again, he was getting hammered by Republicans. So, why did he cave?

MULVANEY: I -- we talked about it at great length last night, and it's not lost on me that if we made the decision on Thursday, we wouldn't have had the press conference on Thursday regarding -- regarding everything else, but that's fine.

But we did talk about it last night and I honestly think what he is out in the tweet was real. The president isn't one for holding back his feelings and his emotions about something. He was honestly surprised at the level of pushback.

At the end of the day, you know, he still considers himself to be in the hospitality business and he saw an opportunity to take the biggest leaders from around the world, and he wanted to put the absolute best show, the best visit that he possibly could. And he was very comfortable doing it at Doral, and I think we're all surprised at the level of pushback.

I think it's the right decision to change. We'll have to find someplace else. And my guess is we'll find someplace else that the media won't like either for another reason.

WALLACE: I just have to pick up -- you say he considers himself in the hospitality business.

MULVANEY: Sure.

WALLACE: He's the president of the United States.

MULVANEY: Yes, but he's -- that's his background. It's like, I used to be in the real estate business. I don't know what you used to do before you were in the media.

WALLACE: Nothing. That's all I've ever done.

MULVANEY: Yes.

But he wanted to put on a show. He wanted to take care of folks. That's the business -- he's in the hotel business or at least he was before he was the president.

WALLACE: Does he understand -- forget the media -- does he understand that it looked lousy?

MULVANEY: Well, I think he knows. He thinks people think it looks lousy.

Could we have put on an excellent G7 at Doral? Absolutely. Will we end up putting on an excellent G7 someplace else? Yes, we will.

WALLACE: Mick, thank you. Thanks for coming in. Always good to talk with you, sir.

MULVANEY: It's always good to be here. Thank you, sir.

WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss where the House impeachment investigation stands now. And new evidence U.S. officials were concerned as far back as 2015 about Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: For three straight years, radical Democrats have been trying to overthrow the results of a great, great election -- maybe, maybe the greatest election in the history of our country.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: President Trump rallying supporters in Dallas against the House impeachment investigation.

And it's time now for our Sunday group. Former Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz; FOX News political analyst Juan Williams; former Democratic Congresswoman Jane Harman; and from ""The Wall Street Journal"", Kimberley Strassel, author of the new book, ""Resistance (At All Cost"".

Well, Congressman Chaffetz, let me start with you. How damaging do you think the last week has been to President Trump? Testimony from a number of current and former national security officials that the president had Rudy Giuliani's personal lawyer running off-the-books operations when it came to Ukraine. And whatever you make of them, Mick Mulvaney's comments about a quid pro quo?

JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER CONGRESSMAN, R-UT: Well, I wish there was video to show of what was going on in these so-called impeachment hearings because they haven't been open and transparent. I think what Adam Schiff did when he lied, he physically lied in front of the committee when he had a chance to go and talk about that, I don't think they're laying a glove on Donald Trump.

Inside the beltway, there's a frenzy. Out in the heartland, in the Dallas, Texases of the world, it's not moving the meter at all.

WALLACE: Congresswoman Harman, how strong is the case that's being built against the president?

JANE HARMAN, FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN, D-CALIF.: Well, I'm not in the room either, but to be clear, these are depositions, they're not hearings. There are various people were talking under oath. Republicans and Democrats are in the room. The questions are primarily being asked by counsel. But Republicans and Democrats had equal time to ask questions.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: OK. But enough about the process, what do you think of the substance?

HARMAN: So, you know, the substance leaks out, and it's in the press, but I think it hasn't been a good week for the president.

Two good things happened. One is, I think sort of kind of good week, he backed off on the China tariffs. That's a big deal because the economy was about to -- it seems to me soft into a point that it really hurt him. But the other sort of kind of big deal is our troops are moving to Iraq, they are not leaving the area. So, there will be some counter-ISIS movement.

That does not mean I think his Syria decision made any sense. I don't think so. I agree with Mitch McConnell.

WALLACE: Maybe the biggest surprise in my interview with Mick Mulvaney is he doesn't seem to have known about the revelations this week about Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden finally answered questions about his business dealings in Ukraine. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

INTERVIEWER: If your last name wasn't Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma?

HUNTER BIDEN, SON OF JOE BIDEN: I don't know, I don't know. Probably not. I don't think that there's a lot of things that wouldn't have happened in my life that if my last name wasn't Biden.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: But, Kim, we also learned that one of those State Department officials who testified before the House impeachment investigation this week was so disturbed in 2015 when Hunter Biden started working for this Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, and that -- at least the appearance if nothing else, at least the appearance that it seemed to be self-dealing, that he went to the vice president himself, because Biden, of course, was then Vice President, and said this really looks bad and he was turned away.

How big a deal?

KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL EDITORIAL BOARD: Yes, I mean, I think it is a big deal. It surprised no one though because prior to the press deciding that this was a whole issue that we're not allowed to talk about, Joe Biden did nothing wrong, they were writing all the stories about this, and quoting former officials who worked for Joe Biden saying they were uneasy with the situation. And they didn't like that it was happening.

And so -- I mean, the issue here to me has always been -- people like to use the word ""corrupt"", the issue was always been the appearance question, right? It's the question of whether or not Hunter Biden was profiting off of his father's position. You don't really need to go much further than that.

And it is hurting Joe Biden out there with primary voters.

WALLACE: Let's pick up on that one because the president who doesn't like the back down did back down overnight and say, well, OK, I'm not going to hold the summit next June, the G7 summit in Doral, his own resort -- there was really a lot of squealing about it from Republicans and Democrats who said it appeared to be this kind of self-dealing, do you think one of the reasons that he may have done it is because it would certainly -- it seemed to blunt his case against Joe Biden?

JUAN WILLIAMS, POLITICAL ANALYST: I think it did. I think the cancellation is a tiny step in the right direction. But again, this is so blatant and over-the-top self-dealing on the part of the president, putting his self interest, or as Mick Mulvaney said to you, his history as a man in the hospitality business, about the national interest. I think that then speaks to behold Ukrainian deal.

But on a larger point, I think it's one of the campaign promises that he broke. He said he was going to divest himself of all business interests. So this cancellation is a step in the right direction, but think for a second about the idea that he has no problem appointing Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, as some kind of emissary to the Middle East and he's dealing with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, a man who's killed journalists and making excuses. I think this is -- again, this is this is not normal.

WALLACE: That's just a decision, and as Mick Mulvaney said about Rudy Giuliani, the president gets to decide who he wants to do his business. That's just the policy issue.

WILLIAMS: I think that -- again, you're putting your family in positions of critical policy. So, it's apart from the normal operation of foreign policy in the country. It's like the shadow foreign policy that was run by Giuliani.

But again, to my mind, you look at Doral -- the reason I say it's part of a pattern, Chris, is Doral was a struggling property, here is the president saying, here, I'm going to help my own business and forever branded as the prestigious pot because of the G7 was held there.

WALLACE: Kim?

STRASSEL: Well, look, this is a very complicated subject. I'm glad that he decided not to do it because I do think it blunts his message about the appearance of conflict with Hunter Biden. There is a very complicated discussion to be had about whether or not Donald Trump's business empire has actually profited from his business (ph) or more likely, as much of the reporting has shown, he's probably taken a hit. I mean, there's good evidence that his bookings are down out a lot of his places and some --

WALLACE: Nobody made him run for president.

STRASSEL: No, no, I'm not saying -- I mean, I'm just saying I'm not like arguing, oh, poor president. I'm just saying, look at the numbers. You can't just run around and say, oh, you know, the president is profiting off of his presidency, like I think you just have to look at the facts. Yes.

WALLACE: But, Kim, it's about profit.

STRASSEL: Look at the facts.

WALLACE: The emoluments clause says you can't take any compensation from a foreign government.

STRASSEL: Well, we have never had a discussion in the court system about what the emoluments clause actually (INAUDIBLE).

WILLIAMS: Well, I'm just saying, that's what it says.

WALLACE: Well, there are actually a few court cases right now.

HARMAN: We're having it now.

WALLACE: So, we'll see.

All right, we've got to --

STRASSEL: We're going to find out.

WALLACE: Folks, I've got to save time for you for the next panel.

We have to take a break here. Up next, Mayor Pete Buttigieg joins us here in Washington after a debate that has some Democrats saying he can compete with Joe Biden as the centrist voice of the party.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Coming up, Mayor Pete Buttigieg hot off the debate stage, where he went toe to toe with his Democratic rivals.

MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG, D-IND., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything, except this.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: We'll ask him, what's his path to the nomination.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Pete Buttigieg is trying to get back into the top tier of 2020 Democratic candidates. And a strong performance in this week's debate paid off with more than $1 million in campaign contributions in the first 24 hours after the debate.

Joining us now is the mayor of South Bend, Indiana.

And, Mayor, welcome back.

BUTTIGIEG: Good to be with you.

WALLACE: Let's start with your latest poll numbers. In the RealClearPolitics average of recent surveys, you're in fourth place nationally at 5.8 percent, fourth in Iowa with 13 percent, and fourth in New Hampshire at 8.7 percent. As a candidate from the Midwest, and also looking at those numbers, don't you have to finish in the top at least two or three in Iowa or you're done?

BUTTIGIEG: I think it's certainly the case that a strong performance in Iowa is going to be critical to us winning the nomination. And that's what we're building toward. We've got a terrific ground game there, over 22, I believe, field offices now and 100 organizers, and I think a message that's really connecting with Iowans. You know, Democrats there, first and foremost, of course, want to know that we can defeat and replace President Trump. Also want to know how the policies we're putting forward are going to affect their lives. And whether it's Medicare for all who want it or the vision we're putting forward on any of a number of issues, we find that it's resonating.

But even now there are so many Iowans who maybe have it narrowed down to a top three or so but are taking their time, evaluating their choices. And we've got our work cut out for us to close the deal between now and the caucus.

WALLACE: You have stalled to some degree in the polls, as we just pointed out, at least nationally, ever since that terrible police shooting in South Bend, Indiana, this summer. And folks noticed a more aggressive performance by you in this last debate, taking on Elizabeth Warren on Medicare for all, Tulsi Gabbard on troops in Syria, and Beto O'Rourke on gun buybacks.

Take a look at you.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BUTTIGIEG: Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything, except this. Respectfully, Congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong.

I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Was that a conscious effort to jumpstart your campaign?

BUTTIGIEG: Well, these are also topics I'm very passionate about. When it comes to what is being done to not just the Middle East, for example, but to American credibility. The fact that right now people who put their lives on the line, trusting that the United States would have their back, and are now betrayed, the fact that U.S. troops in the field feel that their honor has been stolen from them by their commander in chief, how can you not be fired up about something like that? And this is the season for us to lay out what we care about, what we're passionate about, and what's different among each of the candidates. And I want to make sure there's no question in any voter's mind how their life would be different under my presidency than if any of the others were to be elected.

WALLACE: Well, one of the distinctions you drew sharply is you said that 2021, if a Democrat is elected president, the -- the country can make historic gains on health care and immigration and guns, but not, you said, if they push too far and promise too much.

Do you think that some of the solutions that are being offered, whether it's on climate change, Medicare for all, by Senators Warren and Sanders, are too drastic?

BUTTIGIEG: I think that we have a chance to build an American majority around bold action. But it is the case that we could wreck that majority through purity tests. Look, take the example of this Medicare question. I'm proposing Medicare for all who want it. It means we create a version of Medicare, everybody can get access to it, and if you get -- if you want to keep your private plan, we're OK with that. I think that's a better policy than kicking people off of their plan.

But I also think that it's something that more Americans can get behind. And when you think about the condition our country's going to be in when this presidency comes to an end, one way or the other, when you think about how torn apart by politics we're going to be, how polarized and divided this country is, this, to me, is not a political question, it's a question of governing. The good news is, we can govern in a very bold and forward-leading direction, but we've got to make sure we do it in a way that moves toward unifying rather than further polarizing the American people.

WALLACE: Not surprisingly, the left is firing back at you when Elizabeth Warren said that she will not participate in big fundraisers, even if she is the Democratic nominee against Donald Trump in -- next fall. You said this, let's put it on the screen, we are not going to beat him -- Trump -- with pocket change. Here's how Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded. Small dollar grassroots campaigns, aka what Buttigieg insults here as pocket change, out fundraised him by millions. Our nation's leaders should be working to end the era of big money politics, not protect it.

So, what do you have to say to AOC?

BUTTIGIEG: Well, first of all, you don't go from mayor of South Bend to a competitive presidential candidate without knowing a thing or two about grassroots campaigning. My campaign is fueled by the contributions of almost 600,000 individual donors. And most of those are small contributions. What I'm saying is that we can't go into this fight against Donald Trump with one hand tied behind our back.

Look, the president of the United States and his allies just raised $125 million. They will pull out all of the stops to stay in power. And I think we have a responsibility to the country to make sure that we go into this fight, as Democrats, with everything that we've got, and not unilaterally disarming.

We indeed need to end the era of big money politics. That's why campaign finance reform is so important. And it will never happen as long as the folks currently in charge stay there.

WALLACE: The last time you and I talked was in August and I pointed out to you -- perhaps not too charitably -- that you were at zero percent in the polls among African-Americans. There's a new poll out in the last few days. You're now at two percent support among African-Americans.

When we last talked, you -- you -- you described a big outreach to minority communities, the African-American community. Why isn't it working?

BUTTIGIEG: Look, for me this isn't about the polls, this is about making sure that –

WALLACE: Well, in the end, it is about the polls.

BUTTIGIEG: But in order to do well, you need to deserve to do well. And we're focusing on the substance of what I have to offer. Voters want to know how their lives will be different. And in the case of African-American voters, they want to know what my agenda is for black Americans.

We're putting forward the most comprehensive plan of any candidate to tackle systemic racism in this country. It's everything from empowering black entrepreneurs and fueling business development, to making sure we deal with discrimination in housing and in health, to cutting incarceration in this country by 50 percent because we know that the criminal justice system disproportionately harms African-Americans. We need to continue making that case. It's extremely well-received whenever I have a chance to offer it up, but there are a lot of voters who are still sizing up their options, who need to feel like they know you. And our job is to do that in a short amount of time.

WALLACE: I want to press down on this just a little bit because you talk about needing to deserve it and voters trying to understand who you are.

You were supposed to attend a big fundraiser in Chicago on Friday. And one of the hosts was the same city attorney who worked very hard to block release of this video of police shooting Laquan McDonald. The lawyer backed out of -- of the fundraiser. He also donated $5,600 to your campaign. Particularly at a time when African-Americans are trying to get to know you, isn't that the kind of mistake, Mayor, that you can't afford to make?

BUTTIGIEG: Well, this came to my attention in the morning and within an hour it had been taken care of. Look, the situation there and justice and transparency for Laquan McDonald is much more important to me than a campaign contribution. And we did the right thing as soon as it came to my attention.

WALLACE: Can you understand where people would say, well, this is a guy who wants our vote but he was going to take -- was taking money, and was attending a fundraiser being held by this city attorney?

BUTTIGIEG: And then we took care of it.

Look, I think the biggest question on voter's minds is, how is my life going to be different, especially when that sun comes up, that first day after Donald Trump is president. And the agenda that I'm putting forward, the -- the issues that I want to tackle, I think will speak to black voters and to all voters who are seeking a better life in this country and seeking to turn the page from the chaos and the corruption that we're living under right now.

WALLACE: Mayor Buttigieg, thank you. Thanks for your time. Always good to talk with you. Safe travels on the campaign trail, sir.

BUTTIGIEG: Good to be with you.

WALLACE: When we come back, Turkey agrees to a temporary ceasefire in Syria. We'll ask our Sunday group what it means for U.S. interests in the Middle East.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: The Kurds are very happy./ Turkey is very happy. The United States is very happy. And, you know what, civilization is very happy. It's a great thing for civilization.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: President Trump with an optimistic assessment of the cease-fire brokered by Vice President Pence this week in Turkey.

And we're back now with the panel.

Congresswoman Harman, what you think of the deal that the U.S. made with Turkey?

HARMAN: I think, sadly, Pence and his advisors were scrambling on the plane to come up with some kind of announcement that would make sense. And I salute Pence for trying. However, I don't think he succeeded. I think a deal under these circumstances was impossible. And where we are now is the ceasefire is not holding, the Kurds, our allies, who lost 11,000 people on the battlefield, we lost six, are being massacred. There is now a vacuum being filled by ISIS, by Syria, the Syrian government, and by Russia.

And, guess what, Israel, our -- our deepest ally in the region, is now surrounded by Iran on the Syrian border, by Iran making the missiles from Libya -- from Lebanon smarter on the Lebanese border and by Iran and Tehran. And this is creating an existential threat and leading to really dangerous circumstances.

And, finally, ISIS is regrouping and the ISIS fighters that are regrouping are from Europe and they will get through the Turkish border and attack in Europe.

WALLACE: Congressman Chaffetz, even a lot of staunch Trump supporter's inside the Republican Party have real problems with the agreement and -- and the actions by the president in northern Syria.

Your thoughts?

JASON CHAFFETZ, CONTRIBUTOR: I think the agreement was good, although temporary. We'll see how it stands above and beyond the last few days.

But the president did the right thing. He did exactly what he was campaigning on doing. I believe if you -- if you can't go and fight and win the war, then you bring them home. And, you know what, if the Senate and the House feel so strongly, then pass a piece of legislation. Don't just do some little slap on the hand and right an op-ed and say, oh, tisk, tisk, Mr. President.

WALLACE: You -- you're talking about Mitch McConnell?

CHAFFETZ: Yes. I'm saying that they should actually pass a war powers authorization and do that. Put on your big boy pants and do that.

But the president's doing the right thing.

WALLACE: And then there was the meeting on Syria that was held at the White House this week. Here's the indelible picture of it. It ended with President Trump calling Speaker Pelosi, depending on the account you heard, either a third rate or a third grade politician, not a complement in either case, and Pelosi getting up, as you see here, and walking out.

Here's what they said afterwards.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: That crazy Nancy. She is crazy.

PELOSI: I pray for the president all the time, and I tell them that. I pray for his safety and that of his family. The -- now we have to pray for his health because this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Juan, not only can't they legislate in Congress anymore, they've apparently can't even stand to be in each other's presence.

WILLIAMS: No, I mean, it's -- to me what's key here is that I think you see from the House vote that even Republicans were shocked out of their silence in -- in responding to President Trump by his decision.

WALLACE: You think you'd vote against the president's Syria policy?

WILLIAMS: I think you said it earlier, 129 Republicans voted with the Democratic majority. So it clearly showed there is bipartisan outrage at allowing our allies, the Kurds, to be slaughtered by the Turks in this way.

With response -- in response to your question about the meeting, I think that Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, speaker of the House, the minority leader in the Senate, were strong enough to confront the president in the meeting, to get in his face and say, this is the wrong policy. And the president responded with elementary school, you know, schoolyard bullying, third rate politician. Nancy Pelosi is no third rate politician by anybody's measure.

But I think the key here is the policy, Chris, the policy is the problem. And to be clear, and I think this is in response that Congressman Chaffetz point, this is not about bringing troops home. There are only about 150 troops involved. The president just sent 2,000 to Saudi Arabia. So, I mean, to me, this is about the president pulling our influence out of there, allowing our allies to be slaughtered, and compromising America's integrity and promise to our allies. It's a foreign policy quagmire.

WALLACE: Kim, I wanted you to address a different aspect of that, which is that both sides talk about being able to walk and chew gum at the same time, trying to get some things done. The one thing they particularly talk about is passing the USMCA, the U.S. trade deal with Mexico and Canada. Can they get anything done between the impeachment investigation, the bitterness from that, and the fact that we're -- you could say we're all already in a full-fledged campaign. Certainly by the end of the year we're in a full-fledged campaign.

STRASSEL: Right. I mean whatever happened in that meeting and the dueling narratives, it almost doesn't matter because what it exposes is what you just said, is that when Democrats decided they were going to go forward with this impeachment inquiry, it created a new dynamic in Washington. And this is one of the consequences of it.

I do not see how anyone gets anything done while they're in the middle of - - I mean, think of it from the Trump White House perspective. They're trying to remove him from office. And that just does make it a very difficult circumstance in which he -- then sit down, shake hands, play nice.

I agree, everyone would want there to be progress and I think that the best thing the Trump White House could do would be, to fact, to kind of rise above it and talk about governing and talk about what they've accomplished and what they want to accomplish. But I'm not quite sure that is going to be the dynamic going forward.

HARMAN: Government funding --

WALLACE: Congresswoman, I've got less than a minute left.

Does impeachment and politics poison everything? Does anything get done in Washington between now and November 2020?

HARMAN: Well, that was the history of the Clinton impeachment, everything stopped. But government funding runs out on November 21st, in the middle of whatever it is that we're going to see. And I think it would be tragic if, once again, we put federal workers and -- and the economy through that nightmare. So the Congress has to pass the budget bills. There has to be progress. And I think the leadership of Congress somehow will find a way forward.

WALLACE: So the most they can do is keep the government running?

HARMAN: Keep the government running. Right.

WALLACE: All right.

Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.

Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week,"" trying to solve the 82-year-old mystery, what happened to Amelia Earhart?

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: It is one of the enduring mysteries of the 20th and now the 21st century, but a renowned explorer is determined to solve it.

Here's our ""Power Player of the Week.""

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

ROBERT BALLARD, DEEP-SEA EXPLORER: She said, I can do anything, and then went out and did it.

WALLACE (voice over): Robert Ballard is talking about America Earhart, the world-famous aviator, who's this mysterious disappearance 82 years ago has only added to her legend.

In August, Ballard led an expedition to find some trace of Earhart or her plane. It's the subject of a new ""National Geographic"" documentary.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's shedding new light on one of the world's most captivating people.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In ship number six, it's the world-famous Amelia Earhart.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) is good to go.

BALLARD: It exists. It's not the Loch Ness Monster. It's not Bigfoot. That plane exists, which means you can find it.

WALLACE: Earhart was on an around the world trip in 1937 when her plane vanished in the Pacific.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: For years she pushed the boundaries of what was humanly possible, shattering a dozen records in the air, while breaking barriers for women on the ground.

WALLACE: The leading theory is Earhart ran out of gas near a tiny atoll called Nikumaroro. And that's where Ballard took his ship, the Nautilus, spending two weeks searching the coral reef with surface vessels, drones, and remote underwater vehicles.

BALLARD: It's just hours and hours and hours and hours searching at night with a flashlight. You never know.

WALLACE: Thirty-four years ago, Ballard led another expedition and shocked the world by discovering Titanic.

WALLACE (on camera): How does this search compare to searching for and finding Titanic?

BALLARD: This one's tougher. A lot tougher.

WALLACE (voice over): Ballard feels a kinship with Earhart. They're both Kansans. But there's more.

BALLARD: I always have people say, you're nuts. You can't do it. And then I go do it.

WALLACE (on camera): And is there some Amelia Earhart in that too?

BALLARD: You bet there's a lot of Amelia Earhart in the sky.

WALLACE (voice over): For two weeks Ballard and his team searched the area, on land in case Earhart survived a crash, and underwater.

BALLARD: Whoa. Whoa, that looks like coral, but it's got a hole.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's got a perfect hole. Want to simple it.

BALLARD: Yes, just flip it over.

We pounded the area. This was a full court press with everything we had.

WALLACE (on camera): And, in the end, what did you find?

BALLARD: We didn't find the plane.

WALLACE: How big a disappointment?

BALLARD: Well, you know, I know where it isn't.

WALLACE (voice over): Ballard says that's science. You go down dark alleys, then don't go down them again. Now he plans another expedition in two years using new technology to another site nearby.

BALLARD: I love the toys as much as I -- I love the hunt.

WALLACE (on camera): And you get to do both here.

BALLARD: Absolutely. I love developing the technology, going out and using it, and then coming home and sharing the story.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: The special exhibition, ""Amelia,"" premieres tonight on the National Geographic Channel.

Time now for one final note.

We have declared ourselves the unofficial Sunday show of the Washington Nationals. This week they clinched the National League championship in a four-game sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals, setting up the National's first trip to the World Series. They'll play the Houston Astros in game one of the series Tuesday night right here on Fox.

And someone is so excited that he showed up here today, Teddy Roosevelt, one of the raising (ph) presidents from Nats park has dropped by and Teddy has delegated me to say, go Nats!

WILLIAMS: Go Nats!

CHAFFETZ: Go Nationals!

WALLACE: Teddy, here you go. Don't hold me hanging.

Oh, my God.

WILLIAMS: Go Teddy!

WALLACE: And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next “Fox News Sunday.”

In a new interview, Clinton appeared to float a conspiracy theory that the Russians are “grooming” Hawaii congresswoman and Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard to be a third-party candidate in 2020.

“I'm not making any predictions, but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,” Clinton said, an apparent reference to Gabbard. “She's the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.”

She then accused Stein, who ran against her and Donald Trump in 2016, of also being an asset of Russia: ""That’s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she’s also a Russian asset. I mean -- totally.""

GABBARD DARES CLINTON TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020, FIGHTS BACK AGAINST ASSERTIONS THAT SHE'S A RUSSIAN ASSET

Stein shot back on Friday, challenging Clinton to a one-on-one debate.

""In light of the latest slanderous allegations from @HillaryClinton, I challenge her to a debate. It's past time to give the American people the real debate they deserved in 2016, but were denied by the phony DNC/RNC-controlled Commission on Presidential Debates,"" Stein wrote in a series of tweets. ""It's a shame HRC is peddling conspiracy theories to justify her failure instead of reflecting on real reasons Dems lost in 2016. You can slander progressives as 'Russian assets,' but you can't hide the fact that the DNC sabotaged Sanders & elevated Trump to set the stage for HRC.""

She continued: ""HRC's rant is Exhibit A for how the establishment is using the new Cold War to crack down on dissent & feed the war machine. Instead of addressing the crises working people face, they're painting progressives as the enemy. It's as if they're trying to lose to Trump again.""

Gabbard also had a fiery response to Clinton and dared the former Secretary of State to enter the 2020 race.

""Great! Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain,"" Gabbard wrote in a three-part tweet on Friday. ""From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a concerted campaign to destroy my reputation.""

""We wondered who was behind it and why,"" Gabbard continued in her tweeted answer to Clinton. ""Now we know — it was always you, through your proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose. It’s now clear that this primary is between you and me.

""Don’t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly"" she said in a taunt squarely aimed at Dems' 2016 standard-bearer.

Bernie Sanders of Vermont proudly calls himself a democratic socialist. But fellow Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts – who holds many similar extreme-leftist positions – claims she’s really a capitalist.

That’s a claim that would add a few feet to Pinocchio’s nose.

Warren can call herself anything she wants. She falsely called herself a Native American for years and finally had to apologize for that instance of mislabeling. But if truth in packaging laws applied to politicians, Warren would have to admit she’s no more a capitalist than she is a Native American.

CHARLES PAYNE: ELIZABETH WARREN WANTS TO BREAK APART AN ECONOMY THAT'S WORKING

With her long record of promoting socialist causes and her calls for massive new job-killing government regulations and huge tax increases – on income, wealth, and whatever she can think of to take money from hard-working individuals and businesses – Warren is as much of a socialist as Sanders.

While their views aren’t are identical, the true ideological colors of Comrade Bernie and Comrade Elizabeth are both shades of red.

In the wake of Sanders’ recent heart attack, Warren appears better positioned than ever to become the Democratic Party’s 2020 presidential nominee.

Real Clear Politics’ average of recent presidential surveys shows Warren is now polling eight percentage points higher than Sanders. And in two national surveys – one by The Economist and another by Quinnipiac – Warren is polling higher than the longstanding front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden.

Although Biden has been considered a lock to win the nomination by some analysts for months, it seems unlikely he will be able to compete with a far-left challenger like Warren or Sanders once the race inevitably narrows.

Although Biden is unquestionably a progressive whose policies would cause substantial damage to the U.S., he’s not a radical who wants to dynamite the capitalist system that has made America the most prosperous and powerful nation on the planet. But that’s exactly what Warren and Sanders want to do.

It doesn’t help that Biden’s TV debate performances have made the former vice president look more than a little confused. At times, it appears Biden isn’t sure where he is or what year it is – never mind what the candidates are debating.

Warren is a different story entirely. Her debate performances have been sharp and, at times, impressive – though she sometimes sounds like a nagging schoolteacher berating her young students.

Why, exactly, hasn’t Warren been labeled a “socialist”? The biggest – and perhaps the only – reason is that she and others in her party and the left-leaning media continue to insist she isn’t one, despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary.

For example, in an Oct. 13 interview with ABC News’s “This Week,” Sanders said: “There are differences between Elizabeth and myself. Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.”

Like many of the things oozing from Comrade Bernie’s mouth, this, too, is false. Warren is a socialist through and through and her dangerous, destructive policy plans would – like all socialist proposals – cause substantial harm to America’s economy and society, hurting everyone, including the most impoverished.

Warren understands that if she says she’s a socialist, she’ll lose support from moderate voters whose support she would need in the general election to defeat President Trump. So she pretends she’s not what she really is.

Here are just some of Warren’s many frightening socialist plans for the United States:

Warren has endorsed the “Just Society” proposal of socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. This radical idea would – among other things – redefine poverty in the United States so that potentially tens of millions of additional Americans will be pushed onto social welfare programs like Medicaid. A “Just Society” would also make it illegal to deny illegal immigrants and those who have been convicted of crimes access to welfare programs.

Warren has proposed what she calls The Accountable Capitalism Act. This would force every corporation in America with $1 billion or more in annual revenue to obtain a federal charter from a new regulatory agency. The legislation would require that at least 40 percent of corporate board member be elected by workers, and impose costly new bureaucratic regulations on companies. This would likely cause a mass exodus of the most important businesses from the U.S. – stunting economic growth, sending unemployment skyrocketing, and increasing the national debt

Warren has also proposed imposing a single-payer health care system. This would outlaw most forms of private health insurance and force the more than 140 million Americans now enrolled in private insurance plans onto government-managed health plans – all at a cost of $32 trillion over 10 years. Single-payer models elsewhere in the world require very high taxes and have led to rationing of health care and long wait times. This rationing increases unnecessary pain and suffering for millions of people and in the most extreme cases can lead to some patient deaths.

Warren also wants to spend $500 billion over 10 years to build millions of new housing units, and trillions of dollars to cancel college student loan debt for 42 million Americans. She would also “give every American the opportunity to attend a two-year or four-year public college without paying a dime in tuition or fees.”

Warren, like Sanders, was one of the original cosponsors of Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal. This is the most radical, dangerous, environmentally destructive proposal in modern American history. The Green New Deal would destroy millions of jobs by eliminating most forms of fossil fuel generation and use, including that gasoline-powered vehicle you drive to work every day. It would also create a new system of publicly-owned banks, basic income programs, a federal jobs guarantee, massive new green housing mandates, a universal health food program, and countless new “social justice” programs.

These proposals – and the incredibly high tax increases needed to fund them – would push the U.S. closer than ever to full-blown Marxism, and they are without any doubt in line with socialist principles. This is why self-described socialists like Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez have embraced or even proposed the vast majority of them.

With Halloween just around the corner, millions of children will be dressing up for one night pretending to be all sorts of characters. Warren has stopped pretending to be a Native American, but pretends every day to be a capitalist – while she knows very well that she’s a socialist through and through.

For the sake of our country and the American people, let’s hope voters see through Warren’s masquerade.

Bennet accused Warren and the other 2020 candidates of misrepresenting Sen. Bernie Sanders', I-Vt., original ""Medicare-for-All"" plan and said they are relying on lofty ideals and naivete to save America's health care system.

""I’ve been saying that for months that everybody except Bernie is lying about Bernie’s plan,"" he said earlier in the interview. ""Bernie wrote Medicare-for-all. Bernie has said that it will cost $31 trillion. He’s come up with 16 of that 31 trillion dollars. That’s half.""

WATCH: GABBARD TALKS TO 'TUCKER' ABOUT CLINTON'S REMARKS

The post ratcheted up an already escalating feud that has rocked the presidential primary. Several candidates, including Beto O'Rourke, Andrew Yang and Marianne Williamson, have criticized Clinton's unfounded suggestion that Russians have been ""grooming"" Gabbard to be a third-party spoiler in the race.

Gabbard, D-Hawaii, started the video by referencing her time as the vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) from 2013 to 2016 -- before she quit and threw her support behind Bernie Sanders. At the time, Gabbard accused party leaders of stifling her freedom of speech and unfairly tipping the scales in favor of eventual nominee Hillary Clinton.

""People warned me in 2016 that my endorsement of Bernie Sanders would be the end of my 'political career' -- they said Clinton would never forget,"" Gabbard said in the video, ""that she and her rich and powerful friends -- her allies in politics and the media -- will make sure you're destroyed.""

Gabbard asserted that ""countless hit pieces full of smears"" have been published in an effort to ""destroy"" her reputation, which included years of military and congressional service.

DAVID BOSSIE: HILLARY CLINTON, HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW (HINT: TULSI GABBARD HAS A SOLUTION)

At last week's New York Times-CNN primary debate, Gabbard specifically called out the Times and CNN for waging what she called a propaganda campaign against her, while also promoting endless ""regime-change"" wars.

""The New York Times and CNN have smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime-change war,"" Gabbard said. ""Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist, and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.""

Clinton herself, meanwhile, has come under scrutiny for raising money secretly from Russians when she was secretary of state. ""Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal,"" read a 2015 headline in the Times.

CNN political commentator Van Jones echoed Gabbard's argument on-air, and called out Clinton's ""disinformation"" -- saying ""she just came out against a sitting U.S. congresswoman, a decorated war veteran, and someone who's running for the nomination of our party, with just a complete smear and no facts.""

Jones continued: ""This is a very, very dangerous game -- and there's a backstory here. Let's not forget: Tulsi Gabbard was picked out by the Democratic Party establishment and put at the top of the DNC, and they thought she was going to be their golden girl. And, she got in that position in the DNC, and she looked around, and she saw [then-DNC Chairwoman] Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and other people, Clinton allies, doing stuff they shouldn't have been doing in the primary.

""And, Tulsi publicly quit, and then endorsed Bernie Sanders, and it's been payback hell ever since,"" Jones said.

The brouhaha began in a podcast with former Obama adviser David Plouffe, when Clinton said she wasn't ""making any predictions, but [she thinks Russians] have got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate.""

""She's the favorite of the Russians"" she added, saying they ""have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.""

Clinton described 2016 Green Party candidate Jill Stein as a “Russian asset,"" but didn't explicitly name Gabbard. Then, when Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill was asked if Clinton was referring to Gabbard, he responded: “If the nesting doll fits …”

That prompted Gabbard to respond forcefully to Clinton on Twitter Friday, calling her the ""queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party!""

Gabbard, speaking to Fox News' ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" accused Clinton of targeting her for her anti-war and anti-establishment views. Gabbard has dared Clinton to enter the race, rather than hide behind ""proxies.""

In response, several journalists and analysts openly sided with Clinton -- with The Week declaring Gabbard's comments ""outrageous.""

Two MSNBC panelists even asserted that Gabbard somehow had outed herself as a ""Russian asset"" by responding to Clinton's accusations at all.

""One thing that was interesting about Tulsi Gabbard's response, I mean she went after Hillary Clinton strong, she said she wasn't going to run as a third-party candidate, she never denied being a Russian asset,"" WBUR's Kimberly Atkins said on ""MSNBC Live.""

Atkins continued: ""That was the one aspect that was missing from her response, which you think that would be in the first line or two. It was not there.""

Overlooking the fact that Clinton's spokesperson signaled that Clinton was referring directly to Gabbard, analyst Jonathan Allen responded: ""When Hillary Clinton says there's a Russian asset, doesn't say anybody's name, and Tulsi Gabbard goes, 'How dare you call me a Russian asset?' I mean, you know. ...""

Anchor Jonathan Capehart then excitedly interjected to argue that Gabbard had indeed admitted she was a secret Russian asset, and essentially raised her hand to say, ""Me! Me!"" even though Clinton didn't explicitly ""name names."""

WALLACE CHALLENGES BUTTIGIEG ON 'FOX NEWS SUNDAY'

Buttigieg -- who served in the U.S. Naval Reserve in the Afghanistan War and would be the nation’s first openly gay president if elected -- was up seven percentage points since the previous Suffolk University/USA Today poll in Iowa, in June.

The new poll was conducted Wednesday through Friday, entirely after last Tuesday’s fourth round Democratic presidential nomination debate. Political pundits gave a more aggressive Buttigieg high marks for taking on Warren over how she’d pay for her Medicare-for-all health care plan, targeting Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii over her anti-interventionist stance, and clashing with former Rep. Beto O’Rourke over his mandatory gun buy back proposal.

Buttigieg was followed in the poll by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who stood at 9 percent.

""Iowa is unquestionably up for grabs,"" Suffolk Political Research Center director David Paleologos said.

Paleologos added that Buttigieg ""has found a lane and is accelerating toward the front of the pack, surpassing Bernie Sanders. All of this is happening while the number of undecided voters continues to grow as Democratic caucusgoers pause to reevaluate the changing field.""

""Tulsi is not being groomed by anyone. She is her own person,"" former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke said over the weekend.

Speaking to The Hill, O'Rourke added: ""Obviously has served this country, continues to serve this country in uniform, in Congress, as a candidate for presidency so I think those facts speak for themselves.""

Gabbard, a Hawaii Democratic congresswoman, and Clinton have been sparring since the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee went on a podcast with former Obama adviser David Plouffe last week and said she wasn’t “making any predictions, but [thinks Russians] have got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate.”

HILLARY CLINTON FLOATS CONSPIRACY THAT TULSI GABBARD IS BEING 'GROOMED' BY RUSSIANS

“She’s the favorite of the Russians,” Clinton added, saying they “have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far. “

Clinton’s podcast performance prompted Gabbard to respond forcefully on Twitter, calling her the “queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party!”

An increasing number of other 2020 Democratic candidates have positioned themselves in Gabbard's camp, rejecting Clinton's claims, defending Gabbard and attempting to shift the conversation to other topics.

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang defended Gabbard, saying she “deserves much more respect and thanks than this.”

“She literally just got back from serving our country abroad,” Yang tweeted. Gabbard is a Hawaii Army National Guard major who served in Iraq.

Marianne Williamson, the self-help author, told Gabbard to ""stay strong"" and said she's the victim of attempted ""character assassination.""

“The Democratic establishment has got to stop smearing women it finds inconvenient!” she tweeted. “The character assassination of women who don’t toe the party line will backfire. Stay strong @TulsiGabbard. You deserve respect and you have mine.”

South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, also a veteran, was asked on CNN whether he felt Gabbard was a Russian asset and said: “I don’t know what the basis is for that.”

“I’d prefer to have the conversation be about policy, about what we’re going to do, and about how American lives are going to be different,” Buttigieg said Sunday. “When it comes to any of my Democratic competitors, that’s my focus, making sure that we make very clear the differences—and there are very real differences among us—and making it clear to voters what their choices are. That’s where I’d like the focus to be.”

But some candidates like John Delaney -- while making clear he doesn't agree with Clinton's claim -- trod carefully as to not upset either Gabbard or Clinton.

“I consider Tulsi to be a very good friend. As best I can tell, there’s absolutely no basis for any of those allegations,” Delaney said, while noting he holds Clinton “in the highest regard” and “was a huge supporter for 2016.”

Billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer brushed off the feud altogether.

“It seems to me to be a sideshow. And so as a sideshow, I figure if I continue my schedule, I’ve got enough things to worry about,” he said. “And so I feel as if this is something that’s going to go on and it’s going to go on without me.”

Others, like former Vice President Joe Biden, are distancing themselves from the issue. His campaign declined to comment Monday

Meanwhile, Gabbard herself posted a video message over the weekend claiming Clinton’s accusation was simply payback for her defiance of the party establishment during the 2016 presidential election.

“If they can falsely portray me as a traitor, then they can do it to anyone—and in fact, that’s exactly the message they want to get across to you,” Gabbard said in the video. “If you stand up to Hillary and the party power brokers—if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message.”

She added: “But, here is the truth: They will not intimidate us. They will not silence us.”

Gabbard started the video by referencing her time as the vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) from 2013 to 2016, before she quit and endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., during the 2016 Democratic primary. At the time, Gabbard accused leaders of the party of stifling her freedom of speech and unfairly tipping the scales in favor of the eventual nominee, Hillary Clinton.

“People warned me in 2016 that my endorsement of Bernie Sanders would be the end of my ‘political career’—they said Clinton would never forget…that she and her rich and powerful friends—her allies in politics and the media—will make sure you’re destroyed,” she said in the video.

She went on to say that “countless hit pieces full of smears” have been published in an effort to “destroy” her reputation, which includes years of military and congressional service.

For his part, Sanders tweeted Monday evening: ""Tulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country. People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset.""

Meanwhile, President Trump blasted Clinton on Monday, saying she's ""accusing everyone of being a Russian agent.""

""These people are sick,"" Trump told reporters from the White House. ""There's something wrong with them.""

The claim of Gabbard being a Russian asset first hit the mainstream during last week’s CNN Democratic presidential primary debate when Gabbard called out news outlets for what she called a propaganda campaign against her.

“The New York Times and CNN have smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime-change war,"" Gabbard said. ""Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist, and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.""

Clinton herself, meanwhile, has come under scrutiny for raising money secretly from Russians when she was secretary of state. ""Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal,"" read a 2015 headline in the Times.

CNN political commentator Van Jones echoed Gabbard's argument on-air, and called out Clinton's ""disinformation"" -- saying ""she just came out against a sitting U.S. congresswoman, a decorated war veteran, and someone who's running for the nomination of our party, with just a complete smear and no facts.""

Jones continued: ""This is a very, very dangerous game -- and there's a backstory here. Let's not forget: Tulsi Gabbard was picked out by the Democratic Party establishment and put at the top of the DNC, and they thought she was going to be their golden girl. And, she got in that position in the DNC, and she looked around, and she saw [then-DNC Chairwoman] Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and other people, Clinton allies, doing stuff they shouldn't have been doing in the primary.

""And, Tulsi publicly quit and then endorsed Bernie Sanders, and it's been payback hell ever since,"" Jones said.

Tulsi Gabbard of being a Russian agent. Or, words to that effect.

More accurately, in a podcast hosted by former Obama apparatchik David Plouffe, Clinton said candidate Gabbard is “the favorite of the Russians” and suggested Moscow was supporting her bid through fake social media postings.

Since Gabbard is only polling at 1.2 percent, according to the Real Clear Politics average, Russia doesn’t seem to be helping much. More important, there is zero evidence that any such meddling has occurred.

BRUCE ASHFORD: BETO'S ATTACK ON RELIGIOUS LIBERTY NOT JUST WRONG BUT DISASTROUS — HERE ARE FOUR REASONS WHY

What on earth could have prompted such an outlandish charge? We can start with Clinton’s enduring belief that the Russians were behind her 2016 defeat, in addition to James Comey, misogyny, Bernie Sanders, the Electoral College, the media and innumerable other villains. Hillary has never owned up to having been a widely distrusted, politically inept and arrogant candidate who simply lost an election.

It’s unfortunate, because her inability to take responsibility for the unexpected 2016 loss has helped divide the country and has also made her a laughing stock. Unlike most former candidates, Hillary has seen her approval ratings drop since her campaign, and especially among Democrats. In September 2018, two years after the election, Clinton’s approval stood at 36 percent, an all-time low, and seven points below her ratings on the cusp of the 2016 vote. Among Democrats, her approval was down 11 points.

After 17 years of being voted the most admired woman in the country, Hillary has fallen behind Michelle Obama and is tied with Melania Trump. Boy, that must rankle.

Blame her interminable and whiny book, endless embarrassing speaking tours meant to keep her in the public eye and fluff up her already-copious bank account, and renewed scrutiny of the Clinton Foundation, which, not surprisingly, deflated as donors disappeared.

But mainly, blame her inability to move on, which has prompted her peculiar attack on Gabbard. The animus between the two is not new; in 2016, Gabbard committed the unforgivable sin of endorsing Bernie Sanders. At the time, Gabbard was vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee, which has been accused of tipping the primary contest to Hillary. Her apostasy, consequently, was profound.

Some have speculated that Hillary is itching to throw her hat in the ring, hopeful a third campaign proves the charm.

Gabbard has also challenged Hillary, and the Democratic establishment, on foreign policy. When the Iraq war veteran came out in favor of Bernie, Gabbard described Hillary as someone who “will lead us into more interventionist wars of regime change.”

Gabbard has fired back at Clinton’s Russia comments, calling her the “queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long….”

Gabbard claims her camp has detected a “concerted campaign to destroy my reputation” and now believes that Hillary, “through her proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose” is behind that effort.

The assertion seems far-fetched; why would Hillary Clinton bother to take down a fellow Democrat who is so far behind the pack?

Maybe because in her bitterness Hillary cannot endure anyone else – and especially another female – campaigning and possibly winning in 2020.

Gabbard has suggested as much, tweeting “It’s now clear that this primary is between you and me… Join the race directly.”

Some have speculated that Hillary is itching to throw her hat in the ring, hopeful a third campaign proves the charm. Like many Democrats, she may consider Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is quickly becoming the favorite, too extreme to win a national election against Donald Trump.

In a recent interview with PBS’ Judy Woodruff, Clinton said, ""So maybe there does need to be a re-match. I mean, obviously I can beat him again."" She later said she was joking.

Recently, baited to jump in by President Trump on Twitter Hillary responded “Don’t tempt me. Do your job.”

Before she enters the race, Hillary should review what voters are saying about another run. A recent Rasmussen poll shows that fully 71 percent of voters say she should not run, including 58 percent of her own party. That’s not a great starting point.

Though Hillary is quite positive she would win, suggesting in a CBS interview that “there were many funny things that happened in my election that will not happen again,” the Rasmussen survey tells a different story.

In that poll, she ties Trump in a head-to-head match-up. But remember that on the eve of the 2016 election the polling was unequivocally in her favor. At that time The Daily Beast posted a jubilant column, “Hillary Clinton Leads All Final Polls,” noting a Monmouth poll had the former Secretary of State up by 6 points, while a tracking poll by ABC News and the Washington Post had her ahead by 4 points. It may be, given the apparent bias in Trump surveys, that running even is not good enough.

Three other findings should give her pause. The first is that in that imaginary contest, Clinton wins only 60 percent of the black vote. In 2016, she walked away with 88 percent of that vote. That possible leakage of black votes, which I’ve noted before, is a real danger sign for Hillary, and for Democrats.

Second, only 42 percent of those surveyed think the country would be better off today if Clinton had been elected. Fully 48 percent disagree. That’s an astonishing conclusion, given the daily battering the president receives from the media and his low job approval ratings.

Finally, only 54 percent of Democrats think Hillary won the nomination in 2016 fairly. Imagine the reaction is she was to jump in today, or if she were to be nominated by a deadlocked convention. The remaining dozen or so candidates, and their supporters, would erupt; most likely, a great many would stay home.

It’s time for Hillary to retire to the sidelines. Stop embarrassing Democrats, and herself.

Speaking during a conference call with reporters, Zuckerberg said that he and Buttigieg have a number of mutual friends from college and that a number of his colleagues at Facebook had asked him to pass along their resumes to the South Bend, Ind. mayor in the hopes of obtaining a job on his presidential campaign.

“This should not be misconstrued as if I’m deeply involved in trying to support their campaign or something like that,” said Zuckerberg during the call.

Both Zuckerberg and Buttigieg attended Harvard University, with their time at the Ivy League school overlapping in 2003 and 2004. Buttigieg graduated in 2004. He majored in history and literature, while Zuckerberg famously dropped out of the school in his sophomore year.

Zuckerberg’s comments on advising the Buttigieg campaign came as the social media platform announced a presidential spending tracker, which will allow users on the site to see what regions candidates are targeting and if an ad ran on Facebook, Instagram, or Messenger.

The news also comes on the heels of what many have called Buttigieg’s best debate performance of the 2020 campaign season, with the normally stoic mayor showing rare outward fire by pointedly challenging Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on her health care plan and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, of Texas, on gun control.

Buttigieg’s debate performance saw him get a big boost in the polls, with a recent USA Today/Suffolk poll of Iowa caucus-goers showing him surpassing Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for third place behind Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden.

Buttigieg recognized that campaign finance reform is needed, but claimed Democrats have to gain power first in order to make it happen.

Earlier in the conversation, Buttigieg took a shot at far-left opponents like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who just received Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement. Buttigieg warned that radical approaches to issues like health care will alienate voters and make it more difficult to win.

""I think that we have a chance to build an American majority around bold action, but it is the case that we could wreck that majority through purity tests,"" Buttigieg said. ""Take the example of this Medicare question. I’m proposing Medicare for all who want it. It means we create a version of Medicare, everybody can get access to it, and if you want to keep your private plan we’re okay with that.

I think in so many cases my plans are better. Heck, we are the only people to put out a plan on child poverty. How can that be?”

WARREN SAYS SHE'LL UNVEIL HOW SHE'LL PAY FOR HER MEDICARE-FOR-ALL PLAN

And, he indirectly took aim at Warren, D-Mass., who’s soared in recent months to a tie with former Vice President Joe Biden for the top spot in the 2020 primary race.

“I stand with Elizabeth Warren. I think ‘Medicare-for-all’ is the best way to do it. But, I also actually believe that it’s going to be a process to get there,” Booker noted. “We can’t be in a situation where we’re just talking away insurance from folks.”

Warren has been a major supporter of the “Medicare-for-all” plan introduced in the Senate by 2020 rival Sen. Bernie Sanders. The government-run plan, if enacted, would eliminate private insurance.

Booker, spotlighting his pragmatism, added, “I will not be one of those folks on the stage that’s so rigid to say, ‘It’s my way or the highway and I’m going to sacrifice progress for purity. I’m going to let perfect be the enemy of the good,’ when every American needs more good.”

Asked if some of his nomination rivals were too rigid, Booker answered, “that’s what voters are going to have to decide.”

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Warren came under repeated attack at last week’s fourth-round primary debate over her refusal to discuss whether taxes would go up for middle-class Americans to implement her proposal for a government-run “Medicare-for-all” plan. She announced Sunday that she would soon reveal how the country would pay for it if she were president.

Booker has built up a formidable team in New Hampshire and Iowa, the first two states to vote in the caucus and primary calendar. Analysts have called him a skilled retail campaigner and arguably the best orator in the record-setting field of presidential contenders. But, he’s yet to pop in the polls or have many viral moments.

However, with three and a half months to go until the voting begins, that’s fine with Booker.

“The people that usually win are the people who peak in January, February, not people who are winning in the summer or winning in the fall. We’ve just got to continue doing the work,” he noted.

And, pointing to one-time longshots who ended up winning the nomination and eventually the White House, he said, “the more people who hear my message, the more [success] and momentum we’re getting and I’m hoping that continues to rise. And, by the time we’re in next year, I hope we’ll do what Bill Clinton, the comeback kid, or Jimmy Carter – who won New Hampshire – I’ll follow in their footsteps.”"

Warren, one of the leading Democrats seeking to unseat President Trump in 2020, spoke to reporters Monday after an event at Roosevelt High school in Des Moines, Iowa, when the topic of “Medicare-for-all” was raised.

During the media gaggle, Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked Warren: “How should caucus-goers be confident it is possible to pay for 'Medicare-for-all’ at all if the leading Democratic candidate still needs a few more weeks to tell them how it is going to get paid for?”

In response, Warren replied: “Well, why don’t you ask me that when the plan is out.”

POLL: VOTERS OPPOSE 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' SYSTEM THAT ELIMINATES PRIVATE INSURANCE

She did not give any further details.

Warren has been criticized in recent weeks for not explaining exactly how she would cover the costs for her ambitious plan, with two fellow 2020 contenders taking issue with her during last week’s debate.

After being asked by the moderators early at the fourth-round debate in Ohio last Tuesday whether middle-class taxes would rise under her health0care proposal, the progressive senator didn’t specifically answer, instead pledging, “I will not sign a bill into law that does not cut costs for middle-class families.”

Moments later, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg took aim at Warren, who’s soared in polling in recent months and has been considered a frontrunner for the party's presidential nomination alongside former Vice President Joe Biden.

Accusing Warren of being evasive, Buttigieg argued, “Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything— except for this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multitrillion-dollar hole in this 'Medicare-for-all’ plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.”

Warren, firing back at Buttigieg, said: “Let’s be clear, whenever someone hears the term 'Medicare for all who want it,’ understand what that means: It’s 'Medicare for all who can afford it,’ and that’s the problem we’ve got. 'Medicare-for-all’ is the gold standard.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar then joined Buttigieg in calling out Warren.

The Minnesota Democrat said, “At least [Bernie Sanders is] being honest here in saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes will go up, and I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.”

Suggesting that Warren would never be able to pass her 'Medicare-for-all’ plan through Congress, Klobuchar said: “The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done.”

Biden also chimed in, jabbing at Warren without naming her, accusing her of not being straightforward.

“On the single most important thing facing the American public, I think it’s awfully important to be straightforward with them,” Biden noted. “The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget.”

Clearly the polls say Americans want to feel like they are part of the team. Inclusive. A musical montage from a teen movie where everyone chips in and they save the day. But don’t be fooled: These candidates are not like you, and the policies they support are actually bad for regular Americans. In fact, their slogans should all be the same: ""Do as I say, not as I do.""

Nowhere is this more obvious than when it comes to being green.

TUCKER CARLSON: POLS WHO USE KIDS TO GAIN POWER MAY BE A GREATER 'EXISTENTIAL THREAT' THAN CLIMATE CHANGE?

As part of their required Federal Election Commission quarterly filings, the candidates disclosed how their finances and each campaign have been spending a lot of money on private jet travel. After all, how else does one get from Iowa to New Hampshire? In coach? Taking off shoes at TSA? With campaign donations picking up the tab, private jets make the campaign trail much better.

For a collective group of Democrats who decry fossil fuels, who embrace the radical Green New Deal, who demand we change our habits and diets to reflect the “existential crisis” of climate change, they sure don’t put their campaign money with their mouth is.

Every one of the 2020 candidates supports the Green New Deal (GND) as part of their campaign, and as a reminder, this radical, socialist proposal of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez seeks to make air travel ""obsolete."" Air travel is such a no-no amongst environmentalists that ""flight shaming"" has become a common tactic the green radicals use.

So, why do these candidates get a pass? If they want us to stop flying commercial, why are they justified in flying private?

The Buttigieg campaign said it needs private jets because South Bend isn't convenient to campaign stops and the mayor has a vigorous schedule. Here’s a question for Mayor Pete: If I live in rural America and am busy, can I get an exemption under the Green New Deal you support?

We all know the answer to that question, plebeian.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., say their flights are actually ""carbon neutral"" because they buy carbon offsets, presumably with campaign contributions. That's like justifying a cheesecake for dinner by purchasing my neighbor a treadmill. For his dog. And the treadmill company donates to my campaign. Yet, in the silly and slimy world of D.C. politics and sympathetic press, somehow that excuse evens out.

All these candidates are too cowardly to admit what we all know: They travel on private jets because they can. Playing us for fools just adds insult to injury.

Their private air travel is possible for one reason, and one reason alone: America is great. Right now, there are millions of Americans in rural places like Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, and Artesia, New Mexico, working in the energy industry. These are the men and women who power America doing hard, difficult, even dangerous work, and we all benefit from the fruit of their labor.

We have an incredible amount of oil and gas reserves across this nation, and many are still yet untapped. Our abundant energy means prices are low. A decade ago, oil consistently hovered around $100 a barrel. Today, it is half that. This means cheaper gas and home utility bills. Information technology is reflected in the manufacturing and shipping costs of consumer goods. Abundant energy means we spend less. This is something we should celebrate.

What happens when the Green New Deal does make air travel ""obsolete"" and the 10 million American jobs in the airline industry are lost? What happens when Sanders gets his wish to make fracking illegal by executive order and consequently half our oil and two-thirds our gas comes off the market?

I’ll tell you what happens: You won't fly home for Christmas. You won't buy fruit in winter. Cold weather and athletic clothing with lycra and Core-Tex and nylon won’t be affordable. Food prices will skyrocket. Shipping costs will make European goods unaffordable, and speaking of Europe, forget about going. You can't afford it, because with oil around $200 a barrel, even a cruise is out of the question.

What happens when politicians destroy the fossil fuel industry is, they destroy the economy and our way of life.

Next time you see a candidate in a stump speech decrying climate change, demanding a Green New Deal, even calling energy industry workers ""Criminals,"" just ask a simple question: Will you, candidate, stop using these fossil fuels, the cheap gas, the plastics, the oil, the private jets, in your campaign?

It was former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel who famously said, “You never want to let a serious crisis go to waste. What I mean by that is it gives you an opportunity to do things that you could not do before.”

The tactic has been linked to Saul Alinsky, the radical Chicago community organizer of whom former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential contender Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., are disciples.

CALIFORNIA SALON OWNER BLASTS GOV. NEWSOM OVER HOMELESS CRISIS: HE'S MORE CONCERNED WITH 'TROLLING' TRUMP

In November 2018, California voters defeated a statewide ballot initiative that would have extended rent control statewide. It was soundly rejected by an almost 20-point margin. Every county in the state except for San Francisco voted it down.

Even the Democrat running for governor, Gavin Newsom, indicated his opposition to the initiative. But now that he's in office, the former lieutenant governor and former mayor of San Francisco has changed his position, insisting the state must respond to the homeless problem.

Last week we learned of at least one of the actions the governor plans to take. Newsom signed a statewide rent-control law, overturning the will of the people. He followed the progressive playbook by using the homeless crisis “to do things that you could not do before.”

Progressives assert that the homeless crisis is due in large part to a housing shortage, and that the best way to address the shortage is with rent control. The new law also protects tenants from eviction without good reason and provides compensation to tenants if they are evicted due to renovation.

“The housing crisis is reaching every corner of America, where you’re seeing high home prices, high rents, evictions and homelessness that we’re all struggling to grapple with,” said Assemblyman David Chiu, a San Francisco Democrat who authored the bill. “Protecting tenants is a critical and obvious component of any strategy to address this.”

It may be “obvious” to some, but any scratching of the surface of California's rent law shows it to be utterly useless.

First, the law ignores the fact that the state's epicenters of homelessness, Los Angeles and San Francisco, already have rent control on the books that's even more stringent than what just passed.

In San Francisco, studies show the caps have sharply decreased the supply of rental housing, driving up rents citywide by 5 percent. That's because landlords demolished properties and built pricey new ones to avoid the caps.

If rent control helps reduce homelessness, why is the problem so prevalent in the very cities that already have it? And how is extending it to the rest of the state supposed to address the issue?

Rent control has been a proven failure in addressing housing problems. It prompts landlords to convert their properties into owner-occupied homes, and deters investment in the housing market, aggravating the shortages that caused them in the first place.

The truth the left would prefer you not to know: The homeless problem has little to do with lack of affordable housing. There is plenty of affordable housing in California outside major cities. For instance, next to Los Angeles County is Riverside, where the average rent is $1,525 per month, close to the national average of about $1,400.

Not everyone can afford to live exactly where they want to live. Most Californians understand this.

What politicians must acknowledge is that the real cause of most homelessness is the prevalence of mental illness and substance abuse in the homeless community. According to a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development report, 45 percent of homeless people suffer from mental illness. A University of Pennsylvania report, found that about half suffer from alcohol or drug dependence.

In addition, a U.S. Conference of Mayors report in 2014 revealed that only 18 percent of the homeless are employed. That means that for most, the cost of housing doesn't really matter. They simply can't afford it.

Rent control has been a proven failure in addressing housing problems. It prompts landlords to convert their properties into owner-occupied homes, and deters investment in the housing market, aggravating the shortages that caused them in the first place.

Further, when landlords are limited in their ability to raise rents and cannot freely evict tenants, they will be extremely careful in who they rent to. That has a significant adverse effect on the ability of low-income people to find rental housing. Europe has had such limitations for years, and it's notoriously difficult to qualify for a rental property there.

Europe similarly requires “good cause” before terminating an employee; the thinking being that this will result in fewer layoffs and thus lower unemployment. In fact, it has the opposite effect. The harder it is to fire someone, the more cautious employers are in hiring.

The same concept applies to housing.

Addressing homelessness with a statewide rent-control law highlights why California’s homeless problem has gotten so bad.

State politicians would rather use the crisis to pass pet progressive policies rather than address root causes with real solutions. One can only imagine what progressive “solution” is coming next.

Perhaps a $1,000-a-month “freedom dividend” for the homeless?

WALLACE: And hello again from FOX News in Washington.

We begin with breaking news. President Trump announced by tweet last night he's backing off his controversial decision to hold the G7 Summit next year at his own resort. He says the search will now begin for a new site.

But the president is still under fire even from a growing number of Republicans. GOP congressmen voted by more than 2-1 against his policy in Syria. White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said the president at a political quid pro quo from USA to Ukraine. Mulvaney later denied he said it, and more damaging testimony in the House impeachment investigation.

In a moment we will talk with the president chief of staff who just flinched when I said that.

But, first, let's bring in Kevin Corke with the latest from the White House -- Kevin.

KEVIN CORKE, CORRESPONDENT: Chris, a precarious pause perhaps describes the tenuous nature of the circumstance on the ground in Syria as sporadic skirmishes continue to speckle the region, even as we learn much more about the U.S. strategy for American forces there.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MARK ESPER, DEFENSE SECRETARY: The current game plan is for those forces to reposition into western Iraq, the ones coming out, right? That original 1,000. And then two missions -- one is to help defend Iraq and two is to perform a counter-ISIS mission.

Back in Washington, the impeachment drumbeat reached a fevered pitch as House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff interviewed a cascade of Trump administration officials but Ukraine and a possible quid pro quo tying USA aid to cooperation with a probe into the Biden's business dealings.

Incredibly, the gulf between House Democrats and the White House seem to grow, when Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi stormed out of a White House meeting, accusing the president of having a meltdown over a bipartisan House vote rebuking his pullout in Syria. All as the president late Saturday rescinded his decision to host next year's G7 Summit at his resort in Miami, tweeting: Based on both media and Democrat crazed and irrational hostility, we will no longer consider Trump National Doral Miami -- a reversal that came after withering criticism and accusations of self- dealing.

Can you at least understand and acknowledge that the -- just the appearance of impropriety makes us wince inducing and maybe this is something you maybe want to reconsider?

MULVANEY: He got over that a long time ago. We absolutely believe this is the best place to have it and we are going to have it there.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

CORKE: That was then, this is now. By the way, in that tweet, Chris, the president mentioned Camp David as a possible location for next year's G7 summit. It last hosted the G8 back in 2012 -- Chris.

WALLACE: Kevin Corke, reporting from the White House, Kevin, thanks from that.

Joining us now for an exclusive interview, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.

Mick, welcome back to ""FOX News Sunday"".

MULVANEY: Good morning.

Yes, I flinched a little bit because that's what people are saying that I said, but I didn't say that. But I'm looking forward to the conversation.

WALLACE: All right. Let's have a conversation.

MULVANEY: Yes.

WALLACE: Why -- here's my first question. Why did you say that in that briefing that President Trump had ordered a quid po qro (ph) -- quid pro quo, that investigating the Democrats, that aid to Ukraine depended on investigating the Democrats? Why did you say that?

MULVANEY: Again, that's not what I said. That's what people said I said.

Here's what I said, I'll say it again and hopefully people will listen this time.

There were two reasons that we held up the aid. We talked about this at some length. The first one was the rampant corruption in Ukraine. Ukraine -- by the way, Chris, it's so bad in Ukraine that in 2014, Congress passed a law making it -- making us -- requiring us to make sure that corruption was moving in the right direction. So, corruption is a big deal, everyone knows it.

The president was also concerned about whether or not other nations, specifically European nations, were helping with foreign aid to the Ukraine as well. We talked about that for quite a while now.

I did then mention that in the past, the president had mentioned for me to time to time about the DNC server. He had mentioned the DNC server to other people publicly. He even mentioned it to President Zelensky in the phone call, but it wasn't connected to the aid. And that's where I think people got sidetracked this weekend at that press conference.

WALLACE: But --

MULVANEY: Two reasons for holding back the aid --

WALLACE: Let me pursue that, though --

MULVANEY: Sure.

WALLACE: -- because I believe that anyone listening to what you said in that briefing could come to only one conclusion. Let's play what you said.

MULVANEY: Sure.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MULVANEY: Did he also mention to me in the past that the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely, no question about that. But that's it, and that's what we held up the money.

REPORTER: What you just described is a quid pro quo. It is, funding will not flow unless the investigation into the -- into the Democrats' server happened as well.

MULVANEY: We do -- we do that all the time with foreign policy.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: You were asked specifically by Jonathan Karl, was investigating Democrats one of the conditions for holding up the aide?

MULVANEY: Yes.

WALLACE: Was that part of the quid pro quo? And you said, it happens all the time.

MULVANEY: Yes. But go back and watch what I said before that. I don't know if you guys can cue it or not. There was a long answer about corruption and a long answer about foreign aid.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: No, you totally said that.

MULVANEY: Just like I told you then, and then I said the exact same thing I just said now, which is that he mentioned in passing yes, but the reason that we held back the aid with the two reasons I mentioned. And I can prove it to you. The aid flowed.

Once we were able to satisfy ourselves that corruption was actually -- they were doing better with it, we got that information from our folks from the conversation with Minister (ph) Zelensky and once we were able to establish we had the Office of Management and Budget do research on other countries' aid to Ukraine, it turns out they don't get any lethal aid, but they do give a considerable sum of money and nonlethal aid.

Once those two things were cleared, the money flowed. There was never any connection between the flow of money and the server.

WALLACE: But, Mick, you know, I hate to go through this, but you said what you said.

MULVANEY: Yes.

WALLACE: And the fact is, after that exchange with Jonathan Karl, you were asked another time why the aide was held up. What was the condition for the aid? And you didn't mention two conditions, you mentioned three conditions.

And I want to -- and let's listen to all three of them because this -- you stated it very clearly. Let's listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MULVANEY: Three issues for that. The corruption in the country, whether or not other countries were participating in support of the Ukraine, and whether or not they were cooperating in an ongoing investigation with our Department of Justice. That's completely legitimate.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Not only did you say that investigating the Democrats was one of the three conditions, not two, that you would just said that you would talk about, investigating the Democrats was part of the quid pro quo. You also said, if I may, it was part of the Justice Department investigation into the origins of the Russia probe.

But the fact is that not only did the press think you said it, here's what a statement that was put out by a senior Justice Department official: If the White House was withholding aid in regards to the cooperation of any investigation at the Department of Justice, that is news to us.

Everybody thinks that that's what you said and you didn't. You said right there --

MULVANEY: Right.

WALLACE: -- three points, not two.

MULVANEY: Well, and a couple different things. You again said just a few seconds ago that I said there was a quid pro quo. I never used that language, because there is not a quid pro quo, but --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: You were asked by Jonathan Karl, is -- you described a quid pro quo, and you said, that happens all the time.

MULVANEY: Well -- and reporters will use their language all the time. So, my language never said quid pro quo.

But let's get to the heart of the matter. Go back and look at that list of three things. What was I talking about? Things that was legitimate for the president to do.

Number one, it is legitimate for the president to want to know what's going on with the ongoing investigation into the server. Everybody acknowledges that -- at least I think most normal people do. It's completely legitimate to ask about that.

Number two, it's legitimate to tie the aid to corruption. It's legitimate to tie the aid to foreign aid from other countries. That's what I was talking about with the three.

Can I see how people took at the wrong way? Absolutely. But I never said there were was quid pro quo, because there isn't.

Again, Chris, you've been in these -- in these briefings. You know how back-and-forth is. You know how rapid-fire it is. Look to the facts on the ground, things that you can actually sort of certify.

And what should put this issue to bed is that the money flowed without any connection whatsoever to the DNC server.

WALLACE: But you -- in your first answer which I gave, you said that's why we held up the money. First, you just said here, that it was for two reasons. Now, you're acknowledging it was for three reasons.

If you held up the money for three reasons, that was -- that's a quid pro quo.

MULVANEY: I am not --

WALLACE: You got to satisfy us on those. Now, maybe the president backed off that, but that was the proposition here.

MULVANEY: I'm not acknowledging there's three reasons. Again, let's go back --

WALLACE: You said three reasons.

MULVANEY: Go back -- I recognize that. Go back to what actually happened in the real world.

And, by the way, go to the phone call, go to the phone call, which we've released. I hope you get a chance to talk about that before the --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: I am going to right now.

MULVANEY: You go to the phone call, the president never mentions the aid at all in the phone call. Doesn't say, oh, by the way, I need you to do this, this, this and this or else the money won't flow.

We all know enough about this president that if he feels very strongly about something, he's going to put that out there directly and that didn't happen.

I recognize that folks -- that I didn't speak clearly maybe on Thursday, folks misinterpreted what I said, but the facts are absolutely clear and they are there for everyone to see.

WALLACE: In the briefing you flatly denied any connection between holding up the aide and investigating Joe Biden and his son, right?

MULVANEY: Correct.

WALLACE: OK. In his phone call with President Zelensky, however, President Trump specifically mentions the Bidens. Do me a favor. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani pushed all summer for Ukraine to announce it was investigating Burisma, the company that paid Hunter Biden.

And a former NSC official testified this week before Congress, John Bolton was so disturbed by the way you are directing people to work with Rudy Giuliani, he said, quote, I am not part of whatever drug deal -- he was speaking metaphorically --

MULVANEY: Right.

WALLACE: -- of whatever drug deal Sondland, the U.S. diplomat, and Mulvaney are cooking up.

No question you are following the president's orders, but your fingerprints are all over linking aid to Ukraine with investigating the Bidens.

MULVANEY: OK. No, that's not true. Let's go -- I'll take one of those of the time which is the Bolton thing, because I read that and I was surprised, because John Bolton never complained to me about it. No one at NSC ever complained to me about anything that was going on.

I didn't see Sondland's testimony this week because none of us have seen Sondland's testimony, which is another story entirely. I did get a chance to read his opening statement when he said that Bolton never complained to him. Fiona Hill never got a chance to complain to him.

I think you need to put sort of --

WALLACE: Wait a minute. Fiona Hill is the one who testified. That's the quote came from her.

MULVANEY: Who never complained to Sondland about what was happening, when it was happening.

WALLACE: No, she complained to her boss, John Bolton.

MULVANEY: Who did what?

WALLACE: Who said -- who told her to go immediately to a lawyer --

MULVANEY: Right.

WALLACE: -- at NSC and to complain about it.

MULVANEY: Who works for John Bolton. Yet John Bolton didn't go say anything to anybody. Doesn't that raise a red flag?

But let's go back to the first thing you talk about, which is the president's phone call, because at the end of the day, that's what this is really about, right? That's why we are here was the president phone call with Ukraine.

And you've done the same thing, and I don't blame you personally. Done the same thing with many news outlets have done. You said, do me a favor and then immediately to the Bidens.

Go look at the transcript of the phone conversation.

WALLACE: I have.

MULVANEY: It's, do me a favor, take a look at the DNC server. Then he talks about corruption in the Ukraine. He talks about Rudy Giuliani.

The president of the Ukraine gets on and he talks about a close cooperation between the countries. He talks about corruption. He talks about getting a new ambassador to the U.S.

And the president gets on and talks about Bill Barr. The president talks about a new ambassador between our countries, and then the very end of that passage mentions the Bidens.

Everybody else puts it on TV and says, do me a favor, look at the Bidens. And that's simply not factually accurate.

Go look at the transcript yourself.

WALLACE: Let's turn to Syria. Defense Secretary Esper overnight has said that those thousand troops who are being moved out of Syria are moving to Iraq. They are not as the president claimed coming home.

MULVANEY: Well, they will eventually. I think --

WALLACE: Eventually?

MULVANEY: The quickest way to get them out of danger was to get them into Iraq. Keep in mind what you are facing here. And I think literally the number was 28. You had 28 U.S. Special Forces between tens of thousands of soldiers on one side and tens of thousands of soldiers on the other side.

And I hope that when we release the letter this week, it put -- it put to the bed this nonsense about how the president supposedly green-lighted this invasion. Nothing would be further from the truth and I think the letter made that painfully clear.

WALLACE: No, no, the letter has been released.

MULVANEY: It has been, but I hope now people realize and -- it was -- listen, this is what we deal with this administration all the time. Whether it's on the impeachment or it's on the Ukraine or -- excuse me, on Syria, is people (ph) say, oh, there's a green light. The president green- lighted this and that's what the press reports.

And then we put out facts that absolutely put that to bed and no one comes back and says, well, we were wrong about that.

Go back to the beginning of the impeachment, how did that start, oh, there were supposedly a transcript with eight references to the Bidens and a quid pro quo on foreign aid -- absolutely false. No one ever went back and said, we were wrong about that either.

WALLACE: OK.

MULVANEY: So --

WALLACE: I do -- I'm running out of time and I do have several more questions.

MULVANEY: Lots of things to talk about.

WALLACE: Yes, we do.

I just want to go back to the briefing for one minute. After the briefing and all the blowback and the criticism, did you ever offer or think to offer the president your resignation?

MULVANEY: No, absolutely not.

WALLACE: Was that ever discussed?

MULVANEY: Absolutely, positively not.

WALLACE: OK.

MULVANEY: No, I'm -- listen, I'm very happy working there. Did I have the perfect press conference? No. But again, the facts were on our side.

I didn't get a chance to talk about some of the stuff I wanted to talk about at that press conference, which was, for example, Senator Menendez sending a letter to the Ukraine saying, if you don't cooperate with Mueller, there will be repercussions for you. I haven't had a chance to talk about -- talk about a quid pro quo, Joe Biden admitting that he said he was going to cut off funding unless the prosecutor got fired. If that's not a quid pro quo, I don't know what it is.

So, I haven't a chance at the presser to do everything I wanted to, but I still think I'm doing a pretty good job as the chief of staff and I think the president agrees.

WALLACE: There seems to be a growing number of Republicans in Congress who are -- if not breaking with the president, distancing themselves from the president.

You had Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader who wrote a scathing article about Syria this week. I'm going to put up one of these quotes.

Withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria is a grave strategic mistake and a strategic nightmare for our country.

House Republicans voted against the Trump policy in Syria 129-60, more than 2-1.

And I talked to a very well-connected Republican in Washington this week, somebody whose name you would know well, who says that if the House votes to impeach and it gets to a trial in the Senate, there is now a 20 percent chance he believes -- obviously, it's just an estimate -- now a 20 percent chance enough Republicans will vote with the Democrats to remove the president.

MULVANEY: Oh, that's just absurd. But let's deal with the issue of Syria.

WALLACE: No, let's deal with the issue of whether Republicans -- you're losing your support.

MULVANEY: Same thing. This comment about a 20 percent chance, the person clearly doesn't know what they're talking about.

But talk about the reaction of the Republicans and Democrats up on the Hill to the decision in Syria, president knew that was going to happen. He recognizes the fact that it's not a politically popular in this town to make the decision that he made to move the troops out of Syria. He ran on it. He told people he would do this if he won and he's doing it now because he won.

WALLACE: Forgive me for interrupting, we are running out of time, I just want to ask you, though -- is there any concern that the president is losing those support of Republicans in Congress?

MULVANEY: No, the president is extraordinary popular back home, more popular in the swing districts now that impeachment has started.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: I'm talking about here in Washington.

MULVANEY: Yes, but they -- they have to go home eventually as well. So, no.

Do I have to understand that there are certain folks, especially the neoconservative wing of the party who are upset about the Syria decision? I absolutely do. The president knew that was going to happen.

Again, elections have consequences on foreign policy. That's where we started this conversation and that thankfully they do.

WALLACE: Two final questions. One, a -- one of the people who was testifying in Congress this week in the House impeachment investigation also said that he was so concerned about Hunter Biden getting that job in Ukraine in 2015 that he went to the vice president staff, Biden was then vice president, and said, this looks really bad. And that he was turned away.

Your reaction?

MULVANEY: Good. I'm surprised I haven't heard about it since. My guess is if it happened (ph) during the Trump administration, the news media would have reported on it at very next day.

WALLACE: I'm asking you about it, sir.

MULVANEY: I know you are. And I appreciate that. I'm hearing about it for the first time, I look forward to finding out more about it. It's the first I've heard of that piece of information.

WALLACE: You had not heard -- it's been reported widely in the last 48 hours.

MULVANEY: No, I've been busy in the last 48 hours, Chris.

WALLACE: OK. Well, let me ask you of something else, maybe you don't know this.

MULVANEY: Yes.

WALLACE: But President Trump has decided after he put you out there in that briefing --

MULVANEY: Yes.

WALLACE: -- to announce Doral -- he is back -- he's decided that he's not going to hold it at Doral. He blames it on, quote, the hostile media and their Democratic partners.

But again, he was getting hammered by Republicans. So, why did he cave?

MULVANEY: I -- we talked about it at great length last night, and it's not lost on me that if we made the decision on Thursday, we wouldn't have had the press conference on Thursday regarding -- regarding everything else, but that's fine.

But we did talk about it last night and I honestly think what he is out in the tweet was real. The president isn't one for holding back his feelings and his emotions about something. He was honestly surprised at the level of pushback.

At the end of the day, you know, he still considers himself to be in the hospitality business and he saw an opportunity to take the biggest leaders from around the world, and he wanted to put the absolute best show, the best visit that he possibly could. And he was very comfortable doing it at Doral, and I think we're all surprised at the level of pushback.

I think it's the right decision to change. We'll have to find someplace else. And my guess is we'll find someplace else that the media won't like either for another reason.

WALLACE: I just have to pick up -- you say he considers himself in the hospitality business.

MULVANEY: Sure.

WALLACE: He's the president of the United States.

MULVANEY: Yes, but he's -- that's his background. It's like, I used to be in the real estate business. I don't know what you used to do before you were in the media.

WALLACE: Nothing. That's all I've ever done.

MULVANEY: Yes.

But he wanted to put on a show. He wanted to take care of folks. That's the business -- he's in the hotel business or at least he was before he was the president.

WALLACE: Does he understand -- forget the media -- does he understand that it looked lousy?

MULVANEY: Well, I think he knows. He thinks people think it looks lousy.

Could we have put on an excellent G7 at Doral? Absolutely. Will we end up putting on an excellent G7 someplace else? Yes, we will.

WALLACE: Mick, thank you. Thanks for coming in. Always good to talk with you, sir.

MULVANEY: It's always good to be here. Thank you, sir.

WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss where the House impeachment investigation stands now. And new evidence U.S. officials were concerned as far back as 2015 about Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: For three straight years, radical Democrats have been trying to overthrow the results of a great, great election -- maybe, maybe the greatest election in the history of our country.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: President Trump rallying supporters in Dallas against the House impeachment investigation.

And it's time now for our Sunday group. Former Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz; FOX News political analyst Juan Williams; former Democratic Congresswoman Jane Harman; and from ""The Wall Street Journal"", Kimberley Strassel, author of the new book, ""Resistance (At All Cost"".

Well, Congressman Chaffetz, let me start with you. How damaging do you think the last week has been to President Trump? Testimony from a number of current and former national security officials that the president had Rudy Giuliani's personal lawyer running off-the-books operations when it came to Ukraine. And whatever you make of them, Mick Mulvaney's comments about a quid pro quo?

JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER CONGRESSMAN, R-UT: Well, I wish there was video to show of what was going on in these so-called impeachment hearings because they haven't been open and transparent. I think what Adam Schiff did when he lied, he physically lied in front of the committee when he had a chance to go and talk about that, I don't think they're laying a glove on Donald Trump.

Inside the beltway, there's a frenzy. Out in the heartland, in the Dallas, Texases of the world, it's not moving the meter at all.

WALLACE: Congresswoman Harman, how strong is the case that's being built against the president?

JANE HARMAN, FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN, D-CALIF.: Well, I'm not in the room either, but to be clear, these are depositions, they're not hearings. There are various people were talking under oath. Republicans and Democrats are in the room. The questions are primarily being asked by counsel. But Republicans and Democrats had equal time to ask questions.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: OK. But enough about the process, what do you think of the substance?

HARMAN: So, you know, the substance leaks out, and it's in the press, but I think it hasn't been a good week for the president.

Two good things happened. One is, I think sort of kind of good week, he backed off on the China tariffs. That's a big deal because the economy was about to -- it seems to me soft into a point that it really hurt him. But the other sort of kind of big deal is our troops are moving to Iraq, they are not leaving the area. So, there will be some counter-ISIS movement.

That does not mean I think his Syria decision made any sense. I don't think so. I agree with Mitch McConnell.

WALLACE: Maybe the biggest surprise in my interview with Mick Mulvaney is he doesn't seem to have known about the revelations this week about Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden finally answered questions about his business dealings in Ukraine. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

INTERVIEWER: If your last name wasn't Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma?

HUNTER BIDEN, SON OF JOE BIDEN: I don't know, I don't know. Probably not. I don't think that there's a lot of things that wouldn't have happened in my life that if my last name wasn't Biden.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: But, Kim, we also learned that one of those State Department officials who testified before the House impeachment investigation this week was so disturbed in 2015 when Hunter Biden started working for this Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, and that -- at least the appearance if nothing else, at least the appearance that it seemed to be self-dealing, that he went to the vice president himself, because Biden, of course, was then Vice President, and said this really looks bad and he was turned away.

How big a deal?

KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL EDITORIAL BOARD: Yes, I mean, I think it is a big deal. It surprised no one though because prior to the press deciding that this was a whole issue that we're not allowed to talk about, Joe Biden did nothing wrong, they were writing all the stories about this, and quoting former officials who worked for Joe Biden saying they were uneasy with the situation. And they didn't like that it was happening.

And so -- I mean, the issue here to me has always been -- people like to use the word ""corrupt"", the issue was always been the appearance question, right? It's the question of whether or not Hunter Biden was profiting off of his father's position. You don't really need to go much further than that.

And it is hurting Joe Biden out there with primary voters.

WALLACE: Let's pick up on that one because the president who doesn't like the back down did back down overnight and say, well, OK, I'm not going to hold the summit next June, the G7 summit in Doral, his own resort -- there was really a lot of squealing about it from Republicans and Democrats who said it appeared to be this kind of self-dealing, do you think one of the reasons that he may have done it is because it would certainly -- it seemed to blunt his case against Joe Biden?

JUAN WILLIAMS, POLITICAL ANALYST: I think it did. I think the cancellation is a tiny step in the right direction. But again, this is so blatant and over-the-top self-dealing on the part of the president, putting his self interest, or as Mick Mulvaney said to you, his history as a man in the hospitality business, about the national interest. I think that then speaks to behold Ukrainian deal.

But on a larger point, I think it's one of the campaign promises that he broke. He said he was going to divest himself of all business interests. So this cancellation is a step in the right direction, but think for a second about the idea that he has no problem appointing Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, as some kind of emissary to the Middle East and he's dealing with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, a man who's killed journalists and making excuses. I think this is -- again, this is this is not normal.

WALLACE: That's just a decision, and as Mick Mulvaney said about Rudy Giuliani, the president gets to decide who he wants to do his business. That's just the policy issue.

WILLIAMS: I think that -- again, you're putting your family in positions of critical policy. So, it's apart from the normal operation of foreign policy in the country. It's like the shadow foreign policy that was run by Giuliani.

But again, to my mind, you look at Doral -- the reason I say it's part of a pattern, Chris, is Doral was a struggling property, here is the president saying, here, I'm going to help my own business and forever branded as the prestigious pot because of the G7 was held there.

WALLACE: Kim?

STRASSEL: Well, look, this is a very complicated subject. I'm glad that he decided not to do it because I do think it blunts his message about the appearance of conflict with Hunter Biden. There is a very complicated discussion to be had about whether or not Donald Trump's business empire has actually profited from his business (ph) or more likely, as much of the reporting has shown, he's probably taken a hit. I mean, there's good evidence that his bookings are down out a lot of his places and some --

WALLACE: Nobody made him run for president.

STRASSEL: No, no, I'm not saying -- I mean, I'm just saying I'm not like arguing, oh, poor president. I'm just saying, look at the numbers. You can't just run around and say, oh, you know, the president is profiting off of his presidency, like I think you just have to look at the facts. Yes.

WALLACE: But, Kim, it's about profit.

STRASSEL: Look at the facts.

WALLACE: The emoluments clause says you can't take any compensation from a foreign government.

STRASSEL: Well, we have never had a discussion in the court system about what the emoluments clause actually (INAUDIBLE).

WILLIAMS: Well, I'm just saying, that's what it says.

WALLACE: Well, there are actually a few court cases right now.

HARMAN: We're having it now.

WALLACE: So, we'll see.

All right, we've got to --

STRASSEL: We're going to find out.

WALLACE: Folks, I've got to save time for you for the next panel.

We have to take a break here. Up next, Mayor Pete Buttigieg joins us here in Washington after a debate that has some Democrats saying he can compete with Joe Biden as the centrist voice of the party.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Coming up, Mayor Pete Buttigieg hot off the debate stage, where he went toe to toe with his Democratic rivals.

MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG, D-IND., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything, except this.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: We'll ask him, what's his path to the nomination.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Pete Buttigieg is trying to get back into the top tier of 2020 Democratic candidates. And a strong performance in this week's debate paid off with more than $1 million in campaign contributions in the first 24 hours after the debate.

Joining us now is the mayor of South Bend, Indiana.

And, Mayor, welcome back.

BUTTIGIEG: Good to be with you.

WALLACE: Let's start with your latest poll numbers. In the RealClearPolitics average of recent surveys, you're in fourth place nationally at 5.8 percent, fourth in Iowa with 13 percent, and fourth in New Hampshire at 8.7 percent. As a candidate from the Midwest, and also looking at those numbers, don't you have to finish in the top at least two or three in Iowa or you're done?

BUTTIGIEG: I think it's certainly the case that a strong performance in Iowa is going to be critical to us winning the nomination. And that's what we're building toward. We've got a terrific ground game there, over 22, I believe, field offices now and 100 organizers, and I think a message that's really connecting with Iowans. You know, Democrats there, first and foremost, of course, want to know that we can defeat and replace President Trump. Also want to know how the policies we're putting forward are going to affect their lives. And whether it's Medicare for all who want it or the vision we're putting forward on any of a number of issues, we find that it's resonating.

But even now there are so many Iowans who maybe have it narrowed down to a top three or so but are taking their time, evaluating their choices. And we've got our work cut out for us to close the deal between now and the caucus.

WALLACE: You have stalled to some degree in the polls, as we just pointed out, at least nationally, ever since that terrible police shooting in South Bend, Indiana, this summer. And folks noticed a more aggressive performance by you in this last debate, taking on Elizabeth Warren on Medicare for all, Tulsi Gabbard on troops in Syria, and Beto O'Rourke on gun buybacks.

Take a look at you.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BUTTIGIEG: Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything, except this. Respectfully, Congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong.

I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Was that a conscious effort to jumpstart your campaign?

BUTTIGIEG: Well, these are also topics I'm very passionate about. When it comes to what is being done to not just the Middle East, for example, but to American credibility. The fact that right now people who put their lives on the line, trusting that the United States would have their back, and are now betrayed, the fact that U.S. troops in the field feel that their honor has been stolen from them by their commander in chief, how can you not be fired up about something like that? And this is the season for us to lay out what we care about, what we're passionate about, and what's different among each of the candidates. And I want to make sure there's no question in any voter's mind how their life would be different under my presidency than if any of the others were to be elected.

WALLACE: Well, one of the distinctions you drew sharply is you said that 2021, if a Democrat is elected president, the -- the country can make historic gains on health care and immigration and guns, but not, you said, if they push too far and promise too much.

Do you think that some of the solutions that are being offered, whether it's on climate change, Medicare for all, by Senators Warren and Sanders, are too drastic?

BUTTIGIEG: I think that we have a chance to build an American majority around bold action. But it is the case that we could wreck that majority through purity tests. Look, take the example of this Medicare question. I'm proposing Medicare for all who want it. It means we create a version of Medicare, everybody can get access to it, and if you get -- if you want to keep your private plan, we're OK with that. I think that's a better policy than kicking people off of their plan.

But I also think that it's something that more Americans can get behind. And when you think about the condition our country's going to be in when this presidency comes to an end, one way or the other, when you think about how torn apart by politics we're going to be, how polarized and divided this country is, this, to me, is not a political question, it's a question of governing. The good news is, we can govern in a very bold and forward-leading direction, but we've got to make sure we do it in a way that moves toward unifying rather than further polarizing the American people.

WALLACE: Not surprisingly, the left is firing back at you when Elizabeth Warren said that she will not participate in big fundraisers, even if she is the Democratic nominee against Donald Trump in -- next fall. You said this, let's put it on the screen, we are not going to beat him -- Trump -- with pocket change. Here's how Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded. Small dollar grassroots campaigns, aka what Buttigieg insults here as pocket change, out fundraised him by millions. Our nation's leaders should be working to end the era of big money politics, not protect it.

So, what do you have to say to AOC?

BUTTIGIEG: Well, first of all, you don't go from mayor of South Bend to a competitive presidential candidate without knowing a thing or two about grassroots campaigning. My campaign is fueled by the contributions of almost 600,000 individual donors. And most of those are small contributions. What I'm saying is that we can't go into this fight against Donald Trump with one hand tied behind our back.

Look, the president of the United States and his allies just raised $125 million. They will pull out all of the stops to stay in power. And I think we have a responsibility to the country to make sure that we go into this fight, as Democrats, with everything that we've got, and not unilaterally disarming.

We indeed need to end the era of big money politics. That's why campaign finance reform is so important. And it will never happen as long as the folks currently in charge stay there.

WALLACE: The last time you and I talked was in August and I pointed out to you -- perhaps not too charitably -- that you were at zero percent in the polls among African-Americans. There's a new poll out in the last few days. You're now at two percent support among African-Americans.

When we last talked, you -- you -- you described a big outreach to minority communities, the African-American community. Why isn't it working?

BUTTIGIEG: Look, for me this isn't about the polls, this is about making sure that –

WALLACE: Well, in the end, it is about the polls.

BUTTIGIEG: But in order to do well, you need to deserve to do well. And we're focusing on the substance of what I have to offer. Voters want to know how their lives will be different. And in the case of African-American voters, they want to know what my agenda is for black Americans.

We're putting forward the most comprehensive plan of any candidate to tackle systemic racism in this country. It's everything from empowering black entrepreneurs and fueling business development, to making sure we deal with discrimination in housing and in health, to cutting incarceration in this country by 50 percent because we know that the criminal justice system disproportionately harms African-Americans. We need to continue making that case. It's extremely well-received whenever I have a chance to offer it up, but there are a lot of voters who are still sizing up their options, who need to feel like they know you. And our job is to do that in a short amount of time.

WALLACE: I want to press down on this just a little bit because you talk about needing to deserve it and voters trying to understand who you are.

You were supposed to attend a big fundraiser in Chicago on Friday. And one of the hosts was the same city attorney who worked very hard to block release of this video of police shooting Laquan McDonald. The lawyer backed out of -- of the fundraiser. He also donated $5,600 to your campaign. Particularly at a time when African-Americans are trying to get to know you, isn't that the kind of mistake, Mayor, that you can't afford to make?

BUTTIGIEG: Well, this came to my attention in the morning and within an hour it had been taken care of. Look, the situation there and justice and transparency for Laquan McDonald is much more important to me than a campaign contribution. And we did the right thing as soon as it came to my attention.

WALLACE: Can you understand where people would say, well, this is a guy who wants our vote but he was going to take -- was taking money, and was attending a fundraiser being held by this city attorney?

BUTTIGIEG: And then we took care of it.

Look, I think the biggest question on voter's minds is, how is my life going to be different, especially when that sun comes up, that first day after Donald Trump is president. And the agenda that I'm putting forward, the -- the issues that I want to tackle, I think will speak to black voters and to all voters who are seeking a better life in this country and seeking to turn the page from the chaos and the corruption that we're living under right now.

WALLACE: Mayor Buttigieg, thank you. Thanks for your time. Always good to talk with you. Safe travels on the campaign trail, sir.

BUTTIGIEG: Good to be with you.

WALLACE: When we come back, Turkey agrees to a temporary ceasefire in Syria. We'll ask our Sunday group what it means for U.S. interests in the Middle East.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: The Kurds are very happy./ Turkey is very happy. The United States is very happy. And, you know what, civilization is very happy. It's a great thing for civilization.

WALLACE: President Trump with an optimistic assessment of the cease-fire brokered by Vice President Pence this week in Turkey.

And we're back now with the panel.

Congresswoman Harman, what you think of the deal that the U.S. made with Turkey?

HARMAN: I think, sadly, Pence and his advisors were scrambling on the plane to come up with some kind of announcement that would make sense. And I salute Pence for trying. However, I don't think he succeeded. I think a deal under these circumstances was impossible. And where we are now is the ceasefire is not holding, the Kurds, our allies, who lost 11,000 people on the battlefield, we lost six, are being massacred. There is now a vacuum being filled by ISIS, by Syria, the Syrian government, and by Russia.

And, guess what, Israel, our -- our deepest ally in the region, is now surrounded by Iran on the Syrian border, by Iran making the missiles from Libya -- from Lebanon smarter on the Lebanese border and by Iran and Tehran. And this is creating an existential threat and leading to really dangerous circumstances.

And, finally, ISIS is regrouping and the ISIS fighters that are regrouping are from Europe and they will get through the Turkish border and attack in Europe.

WALLACE: Congressman Chaffetz, even a lot of staunch Trump supporter's inside the Republican Party have real problems with the agreement and -- and the actions by the president in northern Syria.

Your thoughts?

JASON CHAFFETZ, CONTRIBUTOR: I think the agreement was good, although temporary. We'll see how it stands above and beyond the last few days.

But the president did the right thing. He did exactly what he was campaigning on doing. I believe if you -- if you can't go and fight and win the war, then you bring them home. And, you know what, if the Senate and the House feel so strongly, then pass a piece of legislation. Don't just do some little slap on the hand and right an op-ed and say, oh, tisk, tisk, Mr. President.

WALLACE: You -- you're talking about Mitch McConnell?

CHAFFETZ: Yes. I'm saying that they should actually pass a war powers authorization and do that. Put on your big boy pants and do that.

But the president's doing the right thing.

WALLACE: And then there was the meeting on Syria that was held at the White House this week. Here's the indelible picture of it. It ended with President Trump calling Speaker Pelosi, depending on the account you heard, either a third rate or a third grade politician, not a complement in either case, and Pelosi getting up, as you see here, and walking out.

Here's what they said afterwards.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: That crazy Nancy. She is crazy.

PELOSI: I pray for the president all the time, and I tell them that. I pray for his safety and that of his family. The -- now we have to pray for his health because this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Juan, not only can't they legislate in Congress anymore, they've apparently can't even stand to be in each other's presence.

WILLIAMS: No, I mean, it's -- to me what's key here is that I think you see from the House vote that even Republicans were shocked out of their silence in -- in responding to President Trump by his decision.

WALLACE: You think you'd vote against the president's Syria policy?

WILLIAMS: I think you said it earlier, 129 Republicans voted with the Democratic majority. So it clearly showed there is bipartisan outrage at allowing our allies, the Kurds, to be slaughtered by the Turks in this way.

With response -- in response to your question about the meeting, I think that Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, speaker of the House, the minority leader in the Senate, were strong enough to confront the president in the meeting, to get in his face and say, this is the wrong policy. And the president responded with elementary school, you know, schoolyard bullying, third rate politician. Nancy Pelosi is no third rate politician by anybody's measure.

But I think the key here is the policy, Chris, the policy is the problem. And to be clear, and I think this is in response that Congressman Chaffetz point, this is not about bringing troops home. There are only about 150 troops involved. The president just sent 2,000 to Saudi Arabia. So, I mean, to me, this is about the president pulling our influence out of there, allowing our allies to be slaughtered, and compromising America's integrity and promise to our allies. It's a foreign policy quagmire.

WALLACE: Kim, I wanted you to address a different aspect of that, which is that both sides talk about being able to walk and chew gum at the same time, trying to get some things done. The one thing they particularly talk about is passing the USMCA, the U.S. trade deal with Mexico and Canada. Can they get anything done between the impeachment investigation, the bitterness from that, and the fact that we're -- you could say we're all already in a full-fledged campaign. Certainly by the end of the year we're in a full-fledged campaign.

STRASSEL: Right. I mean whatever happened in that meeting and the dueling narratives, it almost doesn't matter because what it exposes is what you just said, is that when Democrats decided they were going to go forward with this impeachment inquiry, it created a new dynamic in Washington. And this is one of the consequences of it.

I do not see how anyone gets anything done while they're in the middle of - - I mean, think of it from the Trump White House perspective. They're trying to remove him from office. And that just does make it a very difficult circumstance in which he -- then sit down, shake hands, play nice.

I agree, everyone would want there to be progress and I think that the best thing the Trump White House could do would be, to fact, to kind of rise above it and talk about governing and talk about what they've accomplished and what they want to accomplish. But I'm not quite sure that is going to be the dynamic going forward.

HARMAN: Government funding --

WALLACE: Congresswoman, I've got less than a minute left.

Does impeachment and politics poison everything? Does anything get done in Washington between now and November 2020?

HARMAN: Well, that was the history of the Clinton impeachment, everything stopped. But government funding runs out on November 21st, in the middle of whatever it is that we're going to see. And I think it would be tragic if, once again, we put federal workers and -- and the economy through that nightmare. So the Congress has to pass the budget bills. There has to be progress. And I think the leadership of Congress somehow will find a way forward.

WALLACE: So the most they can do is keep the government running?

HARMAN: Keep the government running. Right.

WALLACE: All right.

Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.

Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week,"" trying to solve the 82-year-old mystery, what happened to Amelia Earhart?

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: It is one of the enduring mysteries of the 20th and now the 21st century, but a renowned explorer is determined to solve it.

Here's our ""Power Player of the Week.""

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

ROBERT BALLARD, DEEP-SEA EXPLORER: She said, I can do anything, and then went out and did it.

WALLACE (voice over): Robert Ballard is talking about America Earhart, the world-famous aviator, who's this mysterious disappearance 82 years ago has only added to her legend.

In August, Ballard led an expedition to find some trace of Earhart or her plane. It's the subject of a new ""National Geographic"" documentary.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's shedding new light on one of the world's most captivating people.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In ship number six, it's the world-famous Amelia Earhart.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) is good to go.

BALLARD: It exists. It's not the Loch Ness Monster. It's not Bigfoot. That plane exists, which means you can find it.

WALLACE: Earhart was on an around the world trip in 1937 when her plane vanished in the Pacific.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: For years she pushed the boundaries of what was humanly possible, shattering a dozen records in the air, while breaking barriers for women on the ground.

WALLACE: The leading theory is Earhart ran out of gas near a tiny atoll called Nikumaroro. And that's where Ballard took his ship, the Nautilus, spending two weeks searching the coral reef with surface vessels, drones, and remote underwater vehicles.

BALLARD: It's just hours and hours and hours and hours searching at night with a flashlight. You never know.

WALLACE: Thirty-four years ago, Ballard led another expedition and shocked the world by discovering Titanic.

WALLACE (on camera): How does this search compare to searching for and finding Titanic?

BALLARD: This one's tougher. A lot tougher.

WALLACE (voice over): Ballard feels a kinship with Earhart. They're both Kansans. But there's more.

BALLARD: I always have people say, you're nuts. You can't do it. And then I go do it.

WALLACE (on camera): And is there some Amelia Earhart in that too?

BALLARD: You bet there's a lot of Amelia Earhart in the sky.

WALLACE (voice over): For two weeks Ballard and his team searched the area, on land in case Earhart survived a crash, and underwater.

BALLARD: Whoa. Whoa, that looks like coral, but it's got a hole.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's got a perfect hole. Want to simple it.

BALLARD: Yes, just flip it over.

We pounded the area. This was a full court press with everything we had.

WALLACE (on camera): And, in the end, what did you find?

BALLARD: We didn't find the plane.

WALLACE: How big a disappointment?

BALLARD: Well, you know, I know where it isn't.

WALLACE (voice over): Ballard says that's science. You go down dark alleys, then don't go down them again. Now he plans another expedition in two years using new technology to another site nearby.

BALLARD: I love the toys as much as I -- I love the hunt.

WALLACE (on camera): And you get to do both here.

BALLARD: Absolutely. I love developing the technology, going out and using it, and then coming home and sharing the story.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: The special exhibition, ""Amelia,"" premieres tonight on the National Geographic Channel.

Time now for one final note.

We have declared ourselves the unofficial Sunday show of the Washington Nationals. This week they clinched the National League championship in a four-game sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals, setting up the National's first trip to the World Series. They'll play the Houston Astros in game one of the series Tuesday night right here on Fox.

And someone is so excited that he showed up here today, Teddy Roosevelt, one of the raising (ph) presidents from Nats park has dropped by and Teddy has delegated me to say, go Nats!

WILLIAMS: Go Nats!

CHAFFETZ: Go Nationals!

WALLACE: Teddy, here you go. Don't hold me hanging.

Oh, my God.

WILLIAMS: Go Teddy!

WALLACE: And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next “Fox News Sunday.”

NFL teams are keeping a close eye on Brown, and the prolific but controversial wide receiver joining a new team after the trade deadline “would not come as a surprise,” CBS Sports reported Sunday, citing league sources.

LOS ANGELES RAMS' TODD GURLEY MAKES OVER-THE-SHOULDER CATCH IN RETURN FROM INJURY

Rumors have already highlighted A.J. Green, Emmanuel Sanders and Mohamed Sanu as among the possible wide receivers who could be on the move. However, CBS Sports reported a handful of playoff contenders could be looking for more of an upgrade at the position, leading Brown's name to ""come up in internal discussions.”

It’s unclear which teams may be interested in Brown. The NFL trade deadline is 4 p.m. ET on Oct. 29.

While teams reportedly ask themselves some version of ""what can Brown do for us?"" adding the wide receiver also means taking on his substantial baggage.

Brown was accused of sexual assault and rape in a September civil lawsuit by a former personal trainer. He was also accused of sexual assault in a separate report days after the suit was filed. But Brown, who forced his way out of the Oakland Raiders organization only to be signed -- and swiftly released -- by the New England Patriots, was not immediately placed on the NFL Commissioner’s Exempt List.

However, his return to the NFL fold almost guarantees his addition to the list, effectively suspending him with pay until the league’s investigation into the allegations against him are concluded.

BUTTI-BOOM REDUX

USA Today: “It's a new three-way race in Iowa. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who was initially seen as a long-shot presidential contender, has surged within striking distance of former vice president Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses, a Suffolk University/USA TODAY Poll finds. … The poll, taken Wednesday through Friday, put Biden at 18%, Warren at 17% and Buttigieg at 13% among 500 likely Democratic caucusgoers. Those standings reflect significant changes since the Suffolk/USA TODAY poll taken in Iowa at the end of June, when Biden led Warren by double digits and Buttigieg trailed at a distant 6%. California Sen. Kamala Harris, who was then in second place after a strong showing in the first Democratic debate, has plummeted 13 percentage points and is now in a three-way tie for sixth. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders earned 9% support, the same number as in the June poll.”



Buttigieg, Klobuchar try to capitalize - Politico: “Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar shot out of the last Democratic debate with the most precious commodity a presidential candidate can get before the Iowa caucuses: momentum. … The new round of attention for both Midwesterners comes at a key moment: Klobuchar has yet to qualify for the November debate stage, while Buttigieg faced new questions about his campaign’s attention to racial issues. And both of them still have significant ground to make up in the polls. … Based on money and staff footprint, Buttigieg is better positioned: He ended September with $23.4 million in his campaign account — third in the Democratic field — while Klobuchar has $3.7 million to spend. She’s only reached 3 percent in one early-state poll, and she needs three more to qualify for the November debate. On the ground in Iowa, Buttigieg’s staff is about double the size of Klobuchar’s. Both candidates are currently airing TV ads in Iowa.”



Are Dems ready for a Midwest moment? - LAT: “Both long shots are now trying — with swings through early-voting states, new ads and endorsements, and intensified fundraising efforts — to keep their post-debate sizzle hot and find an opening in the contest that has been shaping up as a showdown between Biden and Warren. In the process, they are surfacing a long-simmering debate about the dominance of the party’s liberal wing on the East and West coasts — making a more pointed case than Biden, whose campaign pitch builds on his experience more than ideology. ‘It’s the Midwest versus the rest of the country,’ said Rufus Gifford, who was finance director of President Obama’s reelection campaign in 2012 and is uncommitted in the 2020 race. ‘Both Pete and Amy really focused on the fact that this is the part of the country we need to win, and we are losing.’”



Klobuchar says she’s peaking at the right time - WaPo: “Klobuchar, who struggled for attention in the Democratic primary, says this week's debate helped her catch on at exactly the right time. Her town halls are crowded, with staffers running to get more chairs to pack breweries or event centers. She leads the field in local endorsements, especially state legislators, ‘with more to come,’ she says. She kicked off her bus tour with the support of Andy McKean, a Republican state legislator who bolted his party six months ago and who pronounced Klobuchar the kind of Democrat who could unite America again. ‘If you want to peak in this race,’ she said after a stop in Waterloo, ‘you want to peak now, instead of six months before [the caucuses].’ A few other candidates still draw larger crowds, but Klobuchar is going for a particular kind of caucus-goer: the loyal Democrat who wants to win back those mysterious Trump voters.”



Zuckerberg gave hiring recommendations to Buttigieg campaign - Bloomberg: “Facebook Inc. chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has privately recommended several potential hires to Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign, a rare example of direct political involvement from one of tech’s most powerful executives. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg sent multiple emails to Mike Schmuhl, Buttigieg’s campaign manager, with names of individuals that he might consider hiring, campaign spokesman Chris Meagher confirmed. Priscilla Chan, Zuckerberg’s wife, also sent multiple emails to Schmuhl with staff recommendations. Ultimately, two of the people recommended were hired.”



WARREN SCRAMBLES ON HEALTH INSURANCE

Fox News: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Sunday that in the upcoming weeks she would detail how to pay for her proposal for a government-run ‘Medicare-for-all’ plan. The Massachusetts Democrat and White House candidate said at a town hall in Indianola, Iowa: ‘What I see … is that we need to talk about the cost, and I plan over the next few weeks to put out a plan that talks about specifically the cost of ‘Medicare-for-all,’ and specifically how we pay for it.’ Estimates place the 10-year cost of the ‘Medicare-for-all’ plans at $32-34 trillion. She added about the universal health insurance plan: ‘This is something I’ve been working on for months and months, and it’s got just a little more work until it’s finished.’”



Gabbard uses Hillary in bid for relevancy - Fox News: “Speaking directly to the camera in a video message posted on social media on Sunday, 2020 presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard suggested that Hillary Clinton recently ‘smeared’ her as a ‘Russian asset’ as payback for Gabbard's defiance of the party establishment in 2016. … [In the video Gabbard said,] ‘If you stand up to Hillary and the party power brokers -- if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message. But, here is the truth: They will not intimidate us. They will not silence us.’ … Several candidates, including Beto O'Rourke, Andrew Yang and Marianne Williamson, have criticized Clinton's unfounded suggestion that Russians have been ‘grooming’ Gabbard to be a third-party spoiler in the race.”

TIME OUT: FROM WAY BACK WHEN

AP: “A crew of deep-sea explorers and historians looking for lost World War II warships have found a second Japanese aircraft carrier that went down in the historic Battle of Midway. Vulcan Inc.’s director of undersea operations Rob Kraft and Naval History and Heritage Command historian Frank Thompson reviewed high frequency sonar images of the warship Sunday and say that its dimensions and location mean it has to be the carrier Akagi. The Akagi was found in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument resting in nearly 18,000 feet (5,490 meters) of water more than 1,300 miles (2,090 kilometers) northwest of Pearl Harbor. The researchers used an autonomous underwater vehicle, or AUV, equipped with sonar to find the ship. The vehicle had been out overnight collecting data, and the image of a warship appeared in the first set of readings Sunday morning.”

MULVANEY AGONISTES

Politico: “Mick Mulvaney’s week went from bad to worse on Sunday, as he again tried to explain why President Donald Trump and the administration had withheld aid to Ukraine for weeks — one of Democrats’ central questions in their impeachment inquiry. Mulvaney fumbled during an interview on ‘Fox News Sunday’ when he cited two reasons for the delay, whereas he had listed three during his Thursday news briefing at the White House. He continued to blame reporters for any misunderstanding, a feat that can be tough to pull off when his answers were all delivered on camera and when the host, Chris Wallace, let the tape keep rolling. And he threw red meat to liberals and Democratic presidential candidates who have long questioned the appropriateness of the Trump family continuing to profit from their business holdings while Trump serves as president. … Mulvaney’s interview did not play well among Trump allies and advisers, with one calling it a ‘self-immolation.’”



Party support for Trump gets tested - WSJ: “President Trump faces increasing public and private scrutiny from his own party over a series of recent White House moves, as the House impeachment inquiry reduces his margin for error with fellow Republicans and makes him more vulnerable to attacks. In the past several days, Mr. Trump has been forced to drop plans to host next year’s Group of Seven summit at his Doral golf resort, and a top aide has tried to walk back comments linking Ukraine military aid to an investigation of the president’s political opponents. The fallout of Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria has continued to draw widespread criticism, including from Republicans. Mr. Trump’s support within his party will face fresh tests this week, as key witnesses from the State Department and Pentagon are expected to testify in closed hearings before a trio of House committees on the president’s dealings with Ukraine.”



Continetti: Trump fatigue syndrome - National Review: “I was surprised to read Robert J. Samuelson’s column in the Washington Post arguing for the impeachment and removal of President Trump. Samuelson is, above all, a realist who has looked on economics and politics with a tough and somewhat cynical eye for some 30 years. … Samuelson has reached his breaking point. And he isn’t alone. A large part of the country suffers from Trump Fatigue Syndrome. This is related but not identical to Trump Derangement Syndrome. The sufferers of Trump Fatigue aren’t driven mad by the president. They are just tired of having to wake up every morning to another of his sudden attacks, reversals, exaggerations, and boasts. They want the show to end.”



Dems ready more witnesses for impeachment probe - Reuters: “Democrats on Monday laid out their case for the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump and pressed Republicans to stop supporting Trump by releasing a fact sheet and video they said expose Trump’s efforts to secure victory in the 2020 presidential election with the assistance of Ukraine. The releases ‘encapsulate all the evidence uncovered to date about the president’s months-long pressure campaign to undermine the 2020 election and the extent to which he abused his power by using the levers of government to advance the scheme,’ according to the office of Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives. They also showed how Democrats may approach the charges, or articles of impeachment, they are expected to draw up at the conclusion of the probe. The articles of impeachment, if approved by the House, would then be sent to Senate for a trial on whether to remove Trump from office.”



TRUMP OVERWHELMS DEMS ON SOCIAL MEDIA

NYT: “That campaigns are now being fought largely online is hardly a revelation, yet only one political party seems to have gotten the message. While the Trump campaign has put its digital operation firmly at the center of the president’s re-election effort, Democrats are struggling to internalize the lessons of the 2016 race and adapt to a political landscape shaped by social media. Mr. Trump’s first campaign took far better advantage of Facebook and other platforms that reward narrowly targeted — and, arguably, nastier — messages. And while the president is now embattled on multiple fronts and disfavored by a majority of Americans in most polls, he has one big advantage: His 2020 campaign, flush with cash, is poised to dominate online again, according to experts on both ends of the political spectrum, independent researchers and tech executives. The difference between the parties’ digital efforts, they said, runs far deeper than the distinction between an incumbent’s general-election operation and challengers’ primary campaigns.”



Dems also worry about Trump’s money machine - Politico: “Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee have raised more than $300 million this year for his reelection — more than any other sitting president in history at this point in the campaign. Trump has nearly twice as much cash on hand — $158 million, between his campaign account and the RNC — as Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee had at this time in his successful re-election run. … Democrats, meanwhile, are still four or five months away — at the earliest — from settling on a nominee. ‘We don’t know if the Democratic candidate is going to be able to even compete with such a shorter timeline, even if they have significant resources after the convention,’ said Tara McGowan, founder and chief executive officer of the progressive group ACRONYM. With the Democratic primary in full swing, McGowan said, ‘There’s two separate elections going on, and the really unfortunate part is Trump is the only one involved in the general election today.’”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I've a sad sense of déjà vu: 2020 is shaping up to be another election which leaves no major candidate for whom I can vote. As a conservative, I had serious concerns about Trump's temperament but was long done with the Clintons’ modus operandi. Now I face a similar situation: Vote for someone who, against all military advice and in one stroke, abruptly abandoned allies in the field to danger and death and diminished (if not killed outright) our chances of creating such alliances in the future, or vote for a socialist. As for David Brooks ‘policies can be argued about and reversed,’ in what world? I can think of quite a few bad policies that have never been reversed, amended or fixed because once created, they spawn dependent bureaucracies and constituencies. Attempt to touch them and you'll meet Paul Ryan's fate. Worse, voting for a Democrat lends legitimacy to the vicious, hateful behavior displayed toward Brett Kavanaugh and the underhanded, partisan impeachment inquiry. (Impeachment is a political process, but as you've pointed out, it wasn't intended to be a partisan one.) Many Republican Senators might prefer to remove him, have Pence and peace and be done with it. (Sounds good to me.) But how many will be able to bring themselves to vote for removal, thereby legitimizing a process that locked out their House counterparts? It's growing very grey days in voter land.” – Triche Osborne, Baton Rouge, La.



[Ed. note: I hear you! Another few weeks like the ones we’ve had and I may seek out an island in the Aleutians to live out my days with the polar bears. But… We are very privileged to be alive in this moment. Life, especially as free people, is always a privilege, but how lucky are we to be alive at a moment when America, the West, and really, our whole species is fundamentally re-evaluating what it’s all about. I choose not to despair because history tells me that we will figure it out. Maybe not in a straight line, but we will get there. I base this not on the fact that there is an arc to history (there isn’t) but rather because we have all of the necessary ingredients to make what comes next freer, fairer and more dedicated the American creed.]



“As you note, there are many indicators supporting your observation that we are in the midst of enormous societal and hence political change. But I would dispute your conclusion that no politician is addressing this change. Andrew Yang had built his campaign explicitly around this change which he believes will accelerate over the next two decades. I am disappointed that you and the rest of the political press have paid so little attention. You may well not agree with his prescriptions, but he has clearly diagnosed the disease and deserves serious consideration. In the last debate, I was struck by his quiet observation about Sweden's wealth tax proposal - it has been tried by several other developed nations and failed - adding - why can't we learn from the experience of others?” – Matt Lincoln, Portola Valley, Calif.



[Ed. note: Yang may be prescient, Mr. Lincoln, but he also is a pessimist. One of the reasons he has connected so well with younger males is that he matches the sense of foreboding common among many millennial dudes. I do grant you that he is one of the few candidates who is even talking about this Gutenberg-level (Johannes not Steve) disruption that’s working its way through our society. I wish politicians in both parties would think about the same stuff.]



“Well I live in the UK and I am 72 years old, but I watch and read Fox News every day without fail… Before Trump decided to run for President I loved this man to death, he is just what I wanted to see in a President of the USA. Today at times I cringe when Trump opens his mouth or goes off on one on Twitter, he is the making of all his problems to date… Now I want Trump to get a 2nd term but he must CONTROL his mouth and have more respect for people who he talks to after all this is the most powerful man on planet Earth…” – Michael O'Connor, West Yorkshire, England

AP: “A BASE jumper who jumped illegally from a northwestern Wisconsin cellphone tower ended up calling the police on himself after his parachute became caught on a guy wire, leaving him dangling perilously 50 feet (15 meters) from the ground. Police say the 20-year-old man jumped from the 300-foot (90-meter) Charter Communications tower in Menomonie on Thursday morning. After his rescue at around 9:30 a.m., the man was treated at Mayo Clinic Health System and arrested for criminal trespass. BASE jumping stands for building, antenna, span and earth — the four common objects from which BASE jumpers launch their descent.”

* The U.S. Supreme Court this morning “threw out a challenge” to Michigan’s gerrymandered legislative map. As Reuters reported, the high court’s action “voided an order in April by a three-judge panel to rework 34 districts in the state legislature and U.S. House of Representatives whose boundaries were crafted purely to advantage Republicans.”

* A new Suffolk/USA Today poll of Iowa Democrats shows a competitive presidential nominating contest, with Joe Biden narrowly leading Elizabeth Warren, 18% to 17%, with Pete Buttigieg not far behind with 13%. Bernie Sanders slipped to fourth in this poll, with 9% support.

* Also of interest, Amy Klobuchar was at 3% in the poll – she’s tied for fifth place – which I think will help move the Minnesota Democrat closer to qualifying for next month’s presidential primary debate.

* Speaking of Minnesota, a new Star Tribune poll found Donald Trump trailing each of the top Democratic contenders in 2020 match-ups. Despite the president’s recent insistence that he expects to win Minnesota next year, the poll showed him trailing Warren by nine points, Biden by 12 points, and Klobuchar by 17 points.

* On the heels of Rep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.) suggesting he’d consider supporting Trump’s impeachment, the Florida Republican announced he’ll retire after just two terms in the U.S. House.

* The day after acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said, “Get over it” after acknowledging the White House’s quid-pro-quo scheme with Ukraine, Trump’s re-election campaign began selling t-shirts with the same phrase.

* Julian Castro’s presidential campaign announced this morning that the former House secretary will end his presidential bid without an additional $800,000 in donations over the next 10 days. Of course, even if the Texas Democrat gets the money, he’s still not yet close to meeting the polling threshold for next month’s primary debate.

* Bernie Sanders returned to the campaign trail over the weekend, holding a massive rally in New York alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). It was his first such event since the Vermont senator’s heart attack earlier this month.

* And Hillary Clinton suggested late last week that Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), a 2020 presidential candidate, would receive Russian support for running as a third-party candidate next year. The congresswoman responded by blasting Clinton as corrupt and “the queen of warmongers.” Gabbard also appeared on Friday night on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News program to respond to the Democratic Party’s 2016 nominee."

Ocasio-Cortez told Killion that she first offered her endorsement to Sanders when he was in the hospital after recent heart surgery because his illness was a “gut check.”

“Neither me, nor the senator, can do this by ourselves,” Ocasio-Cortez said.

Killion was also criticized over another question she asked during the same interview when the CBS reporter pondered if Sanders would select the 30-year-old New Yorker as his running mate if he emerges as the nominee.

“I think I’m too young for that,” she said while laughing.

Amazon announced in February it was turning back on its plans to build a second headquarters in New York City.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for defending fellow 2020 candidate Tulsi Gabbard after Clinton suggested the Hawaii congresswoman is a Russian asset.

“Tulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country. People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset,” Sanders tweeted on Monday.

Adam Parkhomenko, a former Hillary Clinton staffer who bills himself as “one of the Democratic Party’s top grassroots organizers,” attacked Sanders for the tweet.

2020 DEMS DISMISS HILLARY CLINTON'S ATTACKS, RALLY TO TULSI GABBARD'S DEFENSE OVER RUSSIA ACCUSATION

“Bernie joins Trump and thousands of Russian bots in defending the person who blamed the US instead of Assad for gassing his own people. Not to mention his not so stellar voting record on Russian sanctions,” Parkhomenko wrote to his nearly 300,000 followers.

“F--k Bernie. I’d forgotten how much I despise that a--hole. Thanks for the reminder,” Parkhomenko added.

Someone responded to the foul-mouthed Parkhomenko, asking him how the rhetoric is productive.

HILLARY CLINTON FLOATS CONSPIRACY THAT TULSI GABBARD IS BEING 'GROOMED' BY RUSSIANS

“Yeah, let’s wait and talk about it next October. Or maybe we listen to the lady who was right about all of this s--- in ’16,” Parkhomenko shot back. “Sticking together is not s---ting on Hillary and ignoring her warnings.”

Parkhomenko is considered a Clinton superfan and The Washington Post ran a 2018 feature about Parkhomenko headlined, “Meet the Clinton staffer who has devoted his life to her cause. Will it be worth it?”

“[The Clinton] campaign knows it can trust Parkhomenko. They know he has dedicated much of his life, since age 17, to her ascent to the presidency. They know he put off college to work for her, then started the Ready for Hillary super PAC,” the Post wrote. “His fanaticism is a very practical kind. You might even call it . . . Clintonian.”

Appearing on former President Obama aide David Plouffe’s “Campaign HQ” podcast, Clinton did not mention Gabbard specifically by name, though Plouffe ended the podcast by noting Clinton’s “belief that Tulsi Gabbard is going to be a third-party candidate propped up by Trump and the Russians.”

“I'm not making any predictions but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,” Clinton said, in an apparent reference to Gabbard. “She's the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.”

Clinton’s podcast performance prompted Gabbard to respond forcefully on Twitter, calling her the “queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party.”

An increasing number of other 2020 Democratic candidates have also positioned themselves in Gabbard's camp, rejecting Clinton's claims, defending Gabbard and attempting to shift the conversation to other topics. Gabbard herself posted a video message over the weekend claiming Clinton’s accusation was simply payback for her defiance of the party establishment during the 2016 presidential election.

Parkhomenko is the president of the Renegade Group and co-founder of TRR Group, according to his personal website. He worked for Clinton during her failed 2016 campaign.

Bernie Sanders, condemned Clinton's unfounded suggestion that the congresswoman is a secret Russian asset.

Speaking to reporters at an Iowa coffee shop, Gabbard, D-Hawaii, lamented that Clinton had pulled out of a planned appearance at Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Summit, where Gabbard is set to speak. Clinton was said to have abandoned the summit to avoid appearing with former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

""Well, she had something to say about me, and I would have been very happy to have that conversation directly face-to-face with her,"" Gabbard said.

Earlier Monday, Sanders, I-Vt., joined fellow presidential candidates Andrew Yang, Marianne Williamson and Beto O'Rourke in defending Gabbard.

GABBARD REVEALS WHY SHE THINKS CLINTON IS 'SMEARING' HER

""Tulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country,"" Sanders tweeted, referring to Gabbard's overseas deployments. ""People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset.""

Asked for her reaction to Sanders' comment, Gabbard said only, ""Thank you for speaking the truth.""

Gabbard said she had not spoken with Sanders since last week's presidential primary debate.

TRUMP DEFENDS GABBARD, SUGGESTS CLINTON IS 'SICK'

In addition to suggesting Gabbard was a ""Russian asset"" in a recent interview, Clinton asserted, also without evidence, that Russians were ""grooming her to be the third-party candidate"" and spoiler in the 2020 race. Clinton hinted that Gabbard was the ""favorite of the Russians.""

But, Gabbard reiterated to reporters Monday that she would commit to voting for the Democrats' eventual nominee, and would not run as a third-party candidate.

""I've already said that many times,"" Gabbard said when asked if she'd stay with the Democrats instead of mounting a third-party bid.

Gabbard acknowledged that she had met with Trump when he was president-elect in order to discuss foreign policy, but insisted the discussions were not about any potential role in his administration. Gabbard also said she hadn't since talked to Trump about foreign policy.

""I was never offered a job,"" Gabbard said. That was not what is about. I was asked if I wanted to go and speak to the then-president-elect about foreign policy., and that's what I did.""

Also Monday, Trump sounded a note of empathy for Gabbard, saying he had some familiarity with being accused of Russian collaboration without any evidence.

'I said, wait a minute, it took me two-and-a-half years, I wish [Clinton] would have said that earlier because people... have realized she is crazy. She’s crazy,"" the president told Fox News' Sean Hannity.

""She's accusing everyone of being a Russian agent,"" Trump told reporters, referring to Clinton. ""She's not a Russian agent. These people are sick. There’s something wrong with them.""

Trump added that he thought Clinton's substance-free accusations against Gabbard ultimately would help his own political chances in 2020.

Gabbard has asserted that Clinton was targeting her because Gabbard ended her tenure as vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016 by quitting and throwing her support behind Sanders. At the time, Gabbard accused party leaders of stifling her freedom of speech and unfairly tipping the scales in favor of Clinton's presidential campaign.

""People warned me in 2016 that my endorsement of Bernie Sanders would be the end of my 'political career' -- they said Clinton would never forget,"" Gabbard said a video posted on Twitter on Sunday, ""that she and her rich and powerful friends -- her allies in politics and the media -- will make sure you're destroyed.""

After a Clinton spokesperson all but confirmed Clinton was referring specifically to Gabbard as a ""Russian asset,"" Gabbard fired back that Clinton was ""queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party!""

Bennet accused Warren and the other 2020 candidates of misrepresenting Sen. Bernie Sanders', I-Vt., original ""Medicare-for-All"" plan and said they are relying on lofty ideals and naivete to save America's health care system.

""I’ve been saying that for months that everybody except Bernie is lying about Bernie’s plan,"" he said earlier in the interview. ""Bernie wrote Medicare-for-all. Bernie has said that it will cost $31 trillion. He’s come up with 16 of that 31 trillion dollars. That’s half.""

WALLACE CHALLENGES BUTTIGIEG ON 'FOX NEWS SUNDAY'

Buttigieg -- who served in the U.S. Naval Reserve in the Afghanistan War and would be the nation’s first openly gay president if elected -- was up seven percentage points since the previous Suffolk University/USA Today poll in Iowa, in June.

The new poll was conducted Wednesday through Friday, entirely after last Tuesday’s fourth round Democratic presidential nomination debate. Political pundits gave a more aggressive Buttigieg high marks for taking on Warren over how she’d pay for her Medicare-for-all health care plan, targeting Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii over her anti-interventionist stance, and clashing with former Rep. Beto O’Rourke over his mandatory gun buy back proposal.

Buttigieg was followed in the poll by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who stood at 9 percent.

""Iowa is unquestionably up for grabs,"" Suffolk Political Research Center director David Paleologos said.

Paleologos added that Buttigieg ""has found a lane and is accelerating toward the front of the pack, surpassing Bernie Sanders. All of this is happening while the number of undecided voters continues to grow as Democratic caucusgoers pause to reevaluate the changing field.""

The survey – which has a has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 points -- also indicates Sen. Kamala Harris of California plunging 13 points from the June poll, which was conducted following Harris’ strong performance in the first round of primary debates.

The poll is the second piece of evidence pointing toward a post-debate bump for Buttigieg. He also raised $1.1 million in fundraising in the first 24-hours following the debate."

Gabbard on Monday suggested that a meeting with Clinton might be an appropriate next step, as both Democratic and Republican politicians, including President Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders, condemned the suggestion that the congresswoman is a secret Russian asset.

""Well, she had something to say about me, and I would have been very happy to have that conversation directly face-to-face with her,"" Gabbard said.

Speaking to reporters at an Iowa coffee shop, Gabbard, D-Hawaii, lamented that Clinton had pulled out of a planned appearance at Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Summit, where Gabbard is set to speak. Clinton was said to have abandoned the summit to avoid appearing with former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

During the recent interview, Clinton asserted that Russians were ""grooming her to be the third-party candidate"" and spoiler in the 2020 race. Clinton hinted that Gabbard was the ""favorite of the Russians.""

But, Gabbard reiterated to reporters Monday that she would commit to voting for the Democrats' eventual nominee, and would not run as a third-party candidate.

""When you hear firsthand from people from Venezuela or Cuba who have dealt with socialism, who've been driven from their countries, who've dealt with the poverty and the instability it brings to their government, I think it really resonates. So we've launched VictimsOfSocialism.org so we can hear their stories firsthand and it is very powerful,"" RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said on ""Fox & Friends.""

The ""Victims of Socialism"" campaign features a montage, as well as individual videos, of several people warning about socialism after their home nation spun into civil and economic disarray. It's the result of a monthslong effort by the RNC to highlight the dangers that could result from Democratic victories in 2020.

""The American people need to protect the United States from the socialist politics,"" a man identified as Amed G. says in the video.

SANDERS EMBRACES DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM, CALLS FOR NEW DEAL REVIVAL IN CAMPAIGN ADDRESS

""It's crazy. It's incredible. With the socialists, [they] take your liberties and offer little candies. It's all free,"" he said before the video jumped to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., calling for ""free tuition.""

""Victims of Socialism"" represents a broader, apparent strategy by the RNC to tag Democrats with the more left-wing positions that gained steam during the Democratic primary. While the ad mostly targets Democratic candidates like Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., it also points to how a slew of 2020 candidates – including former Vice President Joe Biden, a perceived moderate – have committed to free health care for illegal immigrants.

The ad came as Biden looked less like the presumptive nominee and Warren gained ground in polling for key states. Warren maintains that she's capitalist, although she espouses many of the same policies as Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. — both self-described ""Democratic socialists."" Sanders, who often polls in the top three among Democrats, also enjoyed a raucous rally last week in which progressive icon, Ocasio-Cortez, threw her weight behind him.

The new campaign aims to reinforce the longstanding criticism that socialism is a dream with plans that are divorced from reality.

""The socialist person, the socialist people. They are very good poets and they are very good in oratory,"" Warner M., a former Venezuelan mayor, explained.

After shifting to a clip of Ocasio-Cortez giving an impassioned speech, a woman appeared to describe how she and others made a terrible mistake in ignoring warnings about socialism.

""Of course, we made a terrible mistake. You know? We didn't listen. Many people warned us and said ... 'you need to stop this' and 'you do not need to go for this.' And unfortunately, we made the error of saying, 'that's not going to happen in Venezuela,"" said Karla N., who also left Venezuela.

Warner M. added that socialism begets leaders who are focused on ""how to maintain power.""

Echoing one of the men in the video, McDaniel said Tuesday that the Democratic candidates are ""promising free things like candy"" in order to regain power and urged voters to listen to warnings from others who have lived through socialist governments."

""Tulsi is not being groomed by anyone. She is her own person,"" former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke said over the weekend.

Speaking to The Hill, O'Rourke added: ""Obviously has served this country, continues to serve this country in uniform, in Congress, as a candidate for presidency so I think those facts speak for themselves.""

Gabbard, a Hawaii Democratic congresswoman, and Clinton have been sparring since the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee went on a podcast with former Obama adviser David Plouffe last week and said she wasn’t “making any predictions, but [thinks Russians] have got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate.”

HILLARY CLINTON FLOATS CONSPIRACY THAT TULSI GABBARD IS BEING 'GROOMED' BY RUSSIANS

“She’s the favorite of the Russians,” Clinton added, saying they “have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far. “

Clinton’s podcast performance prompted Gabbard to respond forcefully on Twitter, calling her the “queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party!”

An increasing number of other 2020 Democratic candidates have positioned themselves in Gabbard's camp, rejecting Clinton's claims, defending Gabbard and attempting to shift the conversation to other topics.

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang defended Gabbard, saying she “deserves much more respect and thanks than this.”

“She literally just got back from serving our country abroad,” Yang tweeted. Gabbard is a Hawaii Army National Guard major who served in Iraq.

Marianne Williamson, the self-help author, told Gabbard to ""stay strong"" and said she's the victim of attempted ""character assassination.""

“The Democratic establishment has got to stop smearing women it finds inconvenient!” she tweeted. “The character assassination of women who don’t toe the party line will backfire. Stay strong @TulsiGabbard. You deserve respect and you have mine.”

South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, also a veteran, was asked on CNN whether he felt Gabbard was a Russian asset and said: “I don’t know what the basis is for that.”

“I’d prefer to have the conversation be about policy, about what we’re going to do, and about how American lives are going to be different,” Buttigieg said Sunday. “When it comes to any of my Democratic competitors, that’s my focus, making sure that we make very clear the differences—and there are very real differences among us—and making it clear to voters what their choices are. That’s where I’d like the focus to be.”

But some candidates like John Delaney -- while making clear he doesn't agree with Clinton's claim -- trod carefully as to not upset either Gabbard or Clinton.

“I consider Tulsi to be a very good friend. As best I can tell, there’s absolutely no basis for any of those allegations,” Delaney said, while noting he holds Clinton “in the highest regard” and “was a huge supporter for 2016.”

Billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer brushed off the feud altogether.

“It seems to me to be a sideshow. And so as a sideshow, I figure if I continue my schedule, I’ve got enough things to worry about,” he said. “And so I feel as if this is something that’s going to go on and it’s going to go on without me.”

Others, like former Vice President Joe Biden, are distancing themselves from the issue. His campaign declined to comment Monday

Meanwhile, Gabbard herself posted a video message over the weekend claiming Clinton’s accusation was simply payback for her defiance of the party establishment during the 2016 presidential election.

“If they can falsely portray me as a traitor, then they can do it to anyone—and in fact, that’s exactly the message they want to get across to you,” Gabbard said in the video. “If you stand up to Hillary and the party power brokers—if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message.”

She added: “But, here is the truth: They will not intimidate us. They will not silence us.”

Gabbard started the video by referencing her time as the vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) from 2013 to 2016, before she quit and endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., during the 2016 Democratic primary. At the time, Gabbard accused leaders of the party of stifling her freedom of speech and unfairly tipping the scales in favor of the eventual nominee, Hillary Clinton.

“People warned me in 2016 that my endorsement of Bernie Sanders would be the end of my ‘political career’—they said Clinton would never forget…that she and her rich and powerful friends—her allies in politics and the media—will make sure you’re destroyed,” she said in the video.

She went on to say that “countless hit pieces full of smears” have been published in an effort to “destroy” her reputation, which includes years of military and congressional service.

For his part, Sanders tweeted Monday evening: ""Tulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country. People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset.""

Meanwhile, President Trump blasted Clinton on Monday, saying she's ""accusing everyone of being a Russian agent.""

""These people are sick,"" Trump told reporters from the White House. ""There's something wrong with them.""

The claim of Gabbard being a Russian asset first hit the mainstream during last week’s CNN Democratic presidential primary debate when Gabbard called out news outlets for what she called a propaganda campaign against her.

“The New York Times and CNN have smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime-change war,"" Gabbard said. ""Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist, and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.""

Clinton herself, meanwhile, has come under scrutiny for raising money secretly from Russians when she was secretary of state. ""Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal,"" read a 2015 headline in the Times.

CNN political commentator Van Jones echoed Gabbard's argument on-air, and called out Clinton's ""disinformation"" -- saying ""she just came out against a sitting U.S. congresswoman, a decorated war veteran, and someone who's running for the nomination of our party, with just a complete smear and no facts.""

Jones continued: ""This is a very, very dangerous game -- and there's a backstory here. Let's not forget: Tulsi Gabbard was picked out by the Democratic Party establishment and put at the top of the DNC, and they thought she was going to be their golden girl. And, she got in that position in the DNC, and she looked around, and she saw [then-DNC Chairwoman] Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and other people, Clinton allies, doing stuff they shouldn't have been doing in the primary.

""And, Tulsi publicly quit and then endorsed Bernie Sanders, and it's been payback hell ever since,"" Jones said.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., continued wielding her national clout on Tuesday as she threw her weight behind Jessica Cisneros, a progressive candidate challenging yet another Democratic incumbent that Ocasio-Cortez described as non-responsive to constituent interests.

""The people of South Texas deserve a Democrat like Jessica who is going to fight for real people, not big corporate donors like the Koch Brothers, GEO Group, and Exxon,"" Ocasio-Cortez reportedly said in a jab at Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas. Cuellar serves as the representative for the state's 28th congressional district and previously served as the state's Secretary of State.

Cuellar, who has spent more than a decade in Congress, has received criticism over support for anti-abortion legislation. He also received an ""A"" rating from the National Rifle Association and took donations KochPAC, a group representing the interests of Koch Industries.

“When [Cisneros] is elected, not only will I no longer be the youngest person in Congress — I’ll have a strong new ally in the fight for Medicare for All, getting corporate money out of politics, and fixing our broken immigration system,"" Ocasio-Cortez said, according to the group Justice Democrats.

AOC BACKS SANDERS AT NEW YORK RALLY, CREDITS HIM WITH 'FUNDAMENTALLY' CHANGING POLITICS

Cisneros, 26, previously served as Cuellar's intern. In a pinned tweet, she blasts her former boss as ""Trump's favorite Democrat.""

""I’m the proud daughter of Mexican immigrants and a human rights lawyer. I’m running to take on Trump’s favorite Democrat, @RepCuellar,"" she said. ""It's time for South Texas to have a real Democrat who will fight for la gente, not corporate donors.""

A campaign video shows Cisneros touting her immigrant heritage and questioning whether Cuellar is an authentic Democrat.

""Our congressman claims to be a Democrat but he's voted with Trump nearly 70 percent of the time,"" she says in the video. She also highlighted his votes to cut funding for sanctuary cities and abortion. ""Henry Cuellar fights to protect Trump and the big corporations,"" she says before endorsing a slew of progressive policies like the ""Green New Deal.""

BIDEN DISMISSIVE OF OCASIO-CORTEZ'S EXPECTED ENDORSEMENT OF BERNIE SANDERS

Cuellar's office did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Cuellar previously attacked Ocasio-Cortez and other members of the progressive ""squad"" after they targeted him for a primary. ""They're socialists and they want to impose their vision to Texas and we certainly know that in Texas our vision is very different from ... what I call these Justice Democrats, which are really socialists. They're not really Democrats,"" he said in July.

Ocasio-Cortez, along with Justice Democrats' help, famously won her district's primary, unseating a long-term and powerful incumbent in the House of Representatives.

Since entering Congress, the freshman lawmaker has gained traction in progressive politics, fielding endorsement requests from major presidential candidates and seeing her ""Green New Deal"" mentioned in 2020 candidates' climate plans.

DESIGN STUDIO RELEASING OCASIO-CORTEZ ACTION FIGURE

Ocasio-Cortez has been especially critical of moderate Democrats like former Vice President Joe Biden and previous candidates who opposed ""Medicare for all."" Last week, she publicly endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who has long represented a progressive insurgency pushing Democrats towards a version of socialism.

At the state and local level, she endorsed progressive challengers in Queens, New York, Illinois, and Massachusetts. It's unclear how much sway her endorsements will have in the last two as the first didn't give Tiffany Caban the boost she needed to win the rece for District Attorney.

If previous endorsements are any judge, though, Ocasio-Cortez's latest decision will likely create even more division in the Democratic Party. Rep. Dan Lipinski, D-Ill., blasted Ocasio-Cortez as a harbinger of extremism when she endorsed his primary challenger for the 2020 election. The congresswoman responded by calling his statement ""aggressive.""

""Aggressive statements like these are so casually thrown from corporate candidates towards grassroots ones, yet they never get branded as 'divisive,' despite their rhetoric,"" she said."

""Tulsi Gabbard, much like President Trump, does not take guff from anyone and, unlike many of her Democratic cohorts and competitors, she refuses to kiss the Clinton ring,"" continued Lahren on her show ""Final Thoughts.""

Clinton kicked off a fight with Gabbard by suggesting that the Army National Guard major, who served two tours in the Middle East, is secretly in league with the Russian government.

TRUMP DEFENDS GABBARD, SUGGESTS CLINTON IS 'SICK'

Appearing on the podcast of a former aide to President Barack Obama, Clinton said, in remarks widely interpreted to be in reference to Gabbard, ""I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She's the favorite of the Russians.""

""This, coming from Ms. Crooked, email-deleting, Benghazi lying, pay-for-play Clinton Foundation, failed Russia restart, Hillary Clinton?"" remarked Lahren. ""For her to accuse anybody of being crooked, corrupt, or anything of the sort is so unbelievably tone-deaf and painfully ironic.""

""It’s no question Hillary has it out for Tulsi. The question is why,"" she continued.

""First, Hillary is the leader of the war hawk war party,"" offered Lahren. ""She, along with many neocon Republicans, has been a cheerleader for endless conflict, foreign intervention and the very regime change wars that Tulsi Gabbard rallies against.""

""Secondly,"" said Lahren, ""Hillary may still have bad blood with her over the 2016 Bernie Sanders endorsement. Hillary holding a grudge? Shocking, I know.""

However, Lahren said that she believes the most significant factor driving Clinton to attempt to undermine Gabbard is that ""Tulsi will not fall in line.""

TRUMP REIGNITES FEUD WITH HILLARY CLINTON

""Tulsi is the only Democratic contender willing to directly call out Hillary and the Clinton dynasty. The Clinton regime does not tolerate dissent. They do not tolerate Democrats who don’t fall in line.""

In response to Clinton's accusation, Gabbard tweeted at the former first lady, calling her ""the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long...""

""Even Elizabeth Warren falls in line,"" alleged Lahren.

Indeed, Newsweek reported, ""Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden, both tier-one candidates, have remained largely silent on the issue."" Additionally, the Biden campaign outright declined to comment on Clinton's remarks on Monday.

In the most pointed response yet, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders I-Vt., tweeted, ""People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset."" Notably, Sanders did not mention Clinton by name.

""I don’t know if she’s truly cozy with the Russians or not, but I for damn sure believe it’s her refusal to be cozy with the Clintons that has incurred the wrath of Hillary,"" said Lahren.

""The good news for Tulsi is, outside of the establishment elites, the D.C. beltway brats and the swamp — no one cares what Hillary has to say,"" she concluded.

Since Gabbard is only polling at 1.2 percent, according to the Real Clear Politics average, Russia doesn’t seem to be helping much. More important, there is zero evidence that any such meddling has occurred.

BRUCE ASHFORD: BETO'S ATTACK ON RELIGIOUS LIBERTY NOT JUST WRONG BUT DISASTROUS — HERE ARE FOUR REASONS WHY

What on earth could have prompted such an outlandish charge? We can start with Clinton’s enduring belief that the Russians were behind her 2016 defeat, in addition to James Comey, misogyny, Bernie Sanders, the Electoral College, the media and innumerable other villains. Hillary has never owned up to having been a widely distrusted, politically inept and arrogant candidate who simply lost an election.

It’s unfortunate, because her inability to take responsibility for the unexpected 2016 loss has helped divide the country and has also made her a laughing stock. Unlike most former candidates, Hillary has seen her approval ratings drop since her campaign, and especially among Democrats. In September 2018, two years after the election, Clinton’s approval stood at 36 percent, an all-time low, and seven points below her ratings on the cusp of the 2016 vote. Among Democrats, her approval was down 11 points.

After 17 years of being voted the most admired woman in the country, Hillary has fallen behind Michelle Obama and is tied with Melania Trump. Boy, that must rankle.

Blame her interminable and whiny book, endless embarrassing speaking tours meant to keep her in the public eye and fluff up her already-copious bank account, and renewed scrutiny of the Clinton Foundation, which, not surprisingly, deflated as donors disappeared.

But mainly, blame her inability to move on, which has prompted her peculiar attack on Gabbard. The animus between the two is not new; in 2016, Gabbard committed the unforgivable sin of endorsing Bernie Sanders. At the time, Gabbard was vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee, which has been accused of tipping the primary contest to Hillary. Her apostasy, consequently, was profound.

Some have speculated that Hillary is itching to throw her hat in the ring, hopeful a third campaign proves the charm.

Gabbard has also challenged Hillary, and the Democratic establishment, on foreign policy. When the Iraq war veteran came out in favor of Bernie, Gabbard described Hillary as someone who “will lead us into more interventionist wars of regime change.”

Gabbard has fired back at Clinton’s Russia comments, calling her the “queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long….”

Gabbard claims her camp has detected a “concerted campaign to destroy my reputation” and now believes that Hillary, “through her proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose” is behind that effort.

The assertion seems far-fetched; why would Hillary Clinton bother to take down a fellow Democrat who is so far behind the pack?

Maybe because in her bitterness Hillary cannot endure anyone else – and especially another female – campaigning and possibly winning in 2020.

Gabbard has suggested as much, tweeting “It’s now clear that this primary is between you and me… Join the race directly.”

Some have speculated that Hillary is itching to throw her hat in the ring, hopeful a third campaign proves the charm. Like many Democrats, she may consider Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is quickly becoming the favorite, too extreme to win a national election against Donald Trump.

In a recent interview with PBS’ Judy Woodruff, Clinton said, ""So maybe there does need to be a re-match. I mean, obviously I can beat him again."" She later said she was joking.

Recently, baited to jump in by President Trump on Twitter Hillary responded “Don’t tempt me. Do your job.”

Before she enters the race, Hillary should review what voters are saying about another run. A recent Rasmussen poll shows that fully 71 percent of voters say she should not run, including 58 percent of her own party. That’s not a great starting point.

Though Hillary is quite positive she would win, suggesting in a CBS interview that “there were many funny things that happened in my election that will not happen again,” the Rasmussen survey tells a different story.

In that poll, she ties Trump in a head-to-head match-up. But remember that on the eve of the 2016 election the polling was unequivocally in her favor. At that time The Daily Beast posted a jubilant column, “Hillary Clinton Leads All Final Polls,” noting a Monmouth poll had the former Secretary of State up by 6 points, while a tracking poll by ABC News and the Washington Post had her ahead by 4 points. It may be, given the apparent bias in Trump surveys, that running even is not good enough.

Three other findings should give her pause. The first is that in that imaginary contest, Clinton wins only 60 percent of the black vote. In 2016, she walked away with 88 percent of that vote. That possible leakage of black votes, which I’ve noted before, is a real danger sign for Hillary, and for Democrats.

Second, only 42 percent of those surveyed think the country would be better off today if Clinton had been elected. Fully 48 percent disagree. That’s an astonishing conclusion, given the daily battering the president receives from the media and his low job approval ratings.

Finally, only 54 percent of Democrats think Hillary won the nomination in 2016 fairly. Imagine the reaction is she was to jump in today, or if she were to be nominated by a deadlocked convention. The remaining dozen or so candidates, and their supporters, would erupt; most likely, a great many would stay home.

It’s time for Hillary to retire to the sidelines. Stop embarrassing Democrats, and herself.

Speaking during a conference call with reporters, Zuckerberg said that he and Buttigieg have a number of mutual friends from college and that a number of his colleagues at Facebook had asked him to pass along their resumes to the South Bend, Ind. mayor in the hopes of obtaining a job on his presidential campaign.

“This should not be misconstrued as if I’m deeply involved in trying to support their campaign or something like that,” said Zuckerberg during the call.

WALLACE CHALLENGES BUTTIGIEG ON 'FOX NEWS SUNDAY'

Both Zuckerberg and Buttigieg attended Harvard University, with their time at the Ivy League school overlapping in 2003 and 2004. Buttigieg graduated in 2004. He majored in history and literature, while Zuckerberg famously dropped out of the school in his sophomore year.

Zuckerberg’s comments on advising the Buttigieg campaign came as the social media platform announced a presidential spending tracker, which will allow users on the site to see what regions candidates are targeting and if an ad ran on Facebook, Instagram, or Messenger.

The news also comes on the heels of what many have called Buttigieg’s best debate performance of the 2020 campaign season, with the normally stoic mayor showing rare outward fire by pointedly challenging Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on her health care plan and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, of Texas, on gun control.

""I don't mind being a little professorial at times,"" Buttigieg acknowledged in a conversation with reporters last month. He added, ""Sometimes I think I'm misread because I'm laid-back. I'm misread as being bloodless.""

Buttigieg’s debate performance saw him get a big boost in the polls, with a recent USA Today/Suffolk poll of Iowa caucus-goers showing him surpassing Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for third place behind Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden.

Cardenas playfully tells viewers ""the only person out here is a media coordinator, [the event] doesn't start until later in the day… no one is out here to tell me which car I can't go in, cause some of these are off-limits, so I'm just gonna live on the wild side."" He then gets on top of a yellow Ford Thunderbird and laying on his side, posing on the car.

""I feel like a kid in a candy store without the owners because you can do anything,"" Cardenas says. He then moves on to another car, a pink Thunderbird, and opens the driver's side door — which dings into another vehicle sitting next to it.

He briefly takes a look at the possible damage, and then proceeds to get inside the car and quips that ""nobody's looking,"" before directing the cameraman to zoom in on the spot where the door hit the neighboring vehicle.

Cardenas later crosses through a barrier around a Ford Explorer and hops on top of the hood of the car.

""I would get off that now,"" one of the two on-air hosts tells Cardenas from the studio. He gets off moments later, saying someone in the auto show told him to.

BIDEN AND WARREN CAMPAIGNS SILENT OVER CLINTON ATTACK ON GABBARD: TOMI LAHREN THINKS SHE KNOWS WHY

""You see it on the Democratic side with Hillary Clinton — and now she's going after Tulsi Gabbard calling her a 'Russian asset,'"" he said.

Appearing on former President Obama aide David Plouffe's ""Campaign HQ"" podcast last week, Clinton accused Gabbard – although not referring to her by name – of being a ""Russian asset"" and a ""third-party candidate.""

“I'm not making any predictions but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,” Clinton said. “She's the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.”

Gabbard lashed out at Clinton on Twitter Friday, calling her the ""queen of warmongers [and the] embodiment of corruption"" in response to the allegations.

She also told Fox News' Tucker Carlson on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" last week that Clinton is waging a smear campaign against her because ""she knows she can't control me."" She accused Clinton of having ""blood on her hands"" after the Iraq War she ""championed.""

""Their blood is on her hands. That's why she's smearing my character and trying to undermine my campaign,"" Gabbard said.

In an exclusive interview Monday on “Hannity,” President Trump blasted his former opponent.

""I said, wait a minute, it took me two-and-a-half years, I wish she would have said that earlier because people... have realized she is crazy,"" he told Hannity. ""She’s crazy.”

Some Democrats have made similar claims about Gabbard, but other prominent leaders have slammed Clinton.

""Tulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country,"" wrote Sanders. ""People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset.""

""[Hillary is] not dealing with her loss well,"" said Zeldin. ""She believes that ... the legacy of why she lost is due to – in her mind – the Russians changing the outcome of our election. I think she's convinced herself of it.""

""She has this bitterness towards Russia because of it and she's gotten to the point where she also blames Tulsi Gabbard,"" he concluded.

Hillary Clinton is firmly inserting herself into the campaign – arguing without evidence that Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii is a “Russian asset,” and mocking President Trump’s direct interactions with foreign leaders.

GABBARD SAYS SHE'S OPEN TO FACE-TO-FACE MEETING WITH CLINTON

The former first lady, senator from New York and secretary of state, and the first major-party female presidential nominee, has remained in the spotlight after winning the 2016 national popular vote but losing the election and the White House to Trump. And she’s served as a longtime foil for Republicans.

But her comments and actions in recent days have elevated her relevance in the 2020 campaign to a new level – renewing questions about her role in the race for the White House and sparking some speculation that she still has ambitions to mount a third bid for president.

Her top aides downplay such speculation.

“The short of it is that she’s on a book tour and is feeling unconstrained about speaking her mind,” longtime Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told Fox News. “It’s easy to over-ascribe a strategy about every word she utters, but it’s as simple as that. She’s out there telling the truth.”

Clinton’s criticism of Gabbard and the candidate’s fierce pushback quickly dominated the 2020 campaign headlines. Many of the other Democratic White House hopefuls were asked to weigh in on the conflict.

Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, a top supporter and surrogate for Clinton during the 2016 election, told reporters after a stop in New Hampshire on Monday that “I am disappointed that this has been in the news as long as it’s been. We need to focus on winning this election and that for me, talking about the issues, talking about the urgencies that we have before us and not indulging in what I think is, for me, not a relevant story.”

Booker told reporters throughout the day that “I will not indulge” in weighing in on the controversy or directly reacting to the comments by Clinton or Gabbard.

Gabbard, in a blistering video released over the weekend, suggested that Clinton had “smeared” her as payback for the Hawaii congresswoman’s endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders in the marathon 2016 Democratic presidential primary battle. Gabbard quit her role as a vice chair in the Democratic National Committee to back Sanders – a one-time longshot who waged an outsider fight for the nomination that didn’t end until he endorsed the eventual nominee well after the end of the primaries.

""If you stand up to Hillary and the party power brokers -- if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message,” Gabbard said. “But, here is the truth: They will not intimidate us. They will not silence us.""

Sanders, who’s running a second straight time for the nomination, took to Twitter on Monday to defend Gabbard, an officer in the Hawaii national guard who served in the war in Iraq.

“Tulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country. People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset,” Sanders wrote.

Fellow Democratic presidential contenders former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, and best selling spiritual author Marianne Williamson also defended Gabbard.

In addition to suggesting Gabbard was a ""Russian asset"" during a podcast last week, Clinton asserted, also without evidence, that Moscow was ""grooming her to be the third-party candidate"" to serve as a spoiler in helping Trump’s re-election.

While Clinton’s claims are unsubstantiated, Gabbard – who preaches anti-interventionism as she runs for the White House – has been promoted by Russian state-owned media and some alt-right websites.

Gabbard reiterated on Monday to reporters that she’s committed to not running as a third-party candidate and said she would vote for the eventual Democratic standard-bearer.

CLINTON ADMONISHES TRUMP AFTER HE URGES HER TO RUN AGAIN, SAYING 'DON'T TEMPT ME'

The latest episodes – plus Clinton’s back and forth with Trump on Twitter a week ago when the president tempted her to run again and she responded by saying “don’t tempt me” – all spark a conversation of just what her role should be in the 2020 campaign.

There’s no script for just what a former presidential nominee should do and say in ensuing elections. She’s held conversations with some of the candidates, giving her advice. And she’s helped the party raise money, headlining fundraisers for the Democratic National Committee.

For Booker, Clinton’s role is clear.

“She’s an extraordinary statesperson in our party. This is one of the most successful secretary of states easily in my lifetime,” he highlighted. “She needs to play a leadership role in our party going forward and I am looking forward to her doing so.”

But Larry Cohen, one of Sanders' top supporters, warned that Clinton could harm the eventual 2020 nominee by weighing in against specific candidates, even a longshot like Gabbard.

Clinton has ""put a lifetime into the Democratic Party. She deserves to be heard,"" said Cohen, a prominent member of the Democratic National Committee who also chairs Our Revolution, the spinoff of Sanders' last presidential campaign. But ""in this senior leader role she has,"" Cohen said, ""it's her job to embrace the range of politics within the party and not polarize within it.""

Ah, Hillary Clinton, if you've heard of her.

Meanwhile, an MSNBC panel mocked Tulsi for not denying she was a Russian asset.

""She never denied being a Russian asset ... that's one aspect that was missing from her response,"" an MSNBC guest said to laughs from her fellow panelists.

They said Trump was one, and now they're saying it's a young, clear-eyed female vet who served her country while rejecting conventional ideologies.

Maybe that's why so many Republicans like her. She isn't manufactured to please the bots at MSNBC.

But Hillary is. Her bitter idiotic commentary keeps reminding you of why Trump won.

Think about it. She claims this so-called Russian asset would split the Democratic vote if she went rogue. No.

She'd likely pull more Republicans than Democrats. Despite what Hillary claims, Tulsi's no Jill Stein. She's sane, a vet with a libertarian bent. One who's not to the left of Democrats, but to the right.

Not only is Hillary stupidly wrong about Tulsi, she makes it clear who the Republican asset really is.

“There’s no bigger policy wonk nerd in this race than me. Anybody who knows me in the Senate, that’s my forte,” Booker, D-N.J., highlighted Monday in an interview with Fox News and NHTalkRadio.com.

Booker, who was interviewed aboard his campaign’s New Hampshire RV, emphasized that “there’s been 170-180 plans put out by every candidate. We’re all putting out plans. I love mine. I think in so many cases my plans are better. Heck, we are the only people to put out a plan on child poverty. How can that be?”

And, he indirectly took aim at Warren, D-Mass., who’s soared in recent months to a tie with former Vice President Joe Biden for the top spot in the 2020 primary race.

“I stand with Elizabeth Warren. I think ‘Medicare-for-all’ is the best way to do it. But, I also actually believe that it’s going to be a process to get there,” Booker noted. “We can’t be in a situation where we’re just talking away insurance from folks.”

Warren has been a major supporter of the “Medicare-for-all” plan introduced in the Senate by 2020 rival Sen. Bernie Sanders. The government-run plan, if enacted, would eliminate private insurance.

Booker, spotlighting his pragmatism, added, “I will not be one of those folks on the stage that’s so rigid to say, ‘It’s my way or the highway and I’m going to sacrifice progress for purity. I’m going to let perfect be the enemy of the good,’ when every American needs more good.”

Asked if some of his nomination rivals were too rigid, Booker answered, “that’s what voters are going to have to decide.”

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Warren came under repeated attack at last week’s fourth-round primary debate over her refusal to discuss whether taxes would go up for middle-class Americans to implement her proposal for a government-run “Medicare-for-all” plan. She announced Sunday that she would soon reveal how the country would pay for it if she were president.

Booker has built up a formidable team in New Hampshire and Iowa, the first two states to vote in the caucus and primary calendar. Analysts have called him a skilled retail campaigner and arguably the best orator in the record-setting field of presidential contenders. But, he’s yet to pop in the polls or have many viral moments.

However, with three and a half months to go until the voting begins, that’s fine with Booker.

“The people that usually win are the people who peak in January, February, not people who are winning in the summer or winning in the fall. We’ve just got to continue doing the work,” he noted.

And, pointing to one-time longshots who ended up winning the nomination and eventually the White House, he said, “the more people who hear my message, the more [success] and momentum we’re getting and I’m hoping that continues to rise. And, by the time we’re in next year, I hope we’ll do what Bill Clinton, the comeback kid, or Jimmy Carter – who won New Hampshire – I’ll follow in their footsteps.”"

Krauthammer said Monday on ""Special Report"" hundreds of people have spoken to him as he traveled from city to city to promote ""The Point of It All: A Lifetime of Great Loves and Endeavors,"" and have asked him what his father would think of the current political environment.

""After the hardcover edition came out last winter, I traveled around the country... to promote it and talk to admirers of my father, people who read him and watched him on TV,"" he said.

""It was really moving and touching for me to realize how much of an impact he had on so many people.""

DANIEL KRAUTHAMMER: IN SEARCH OF CIVILITY -- IN OUR POLITICS NOW, WE ARE INCREASINGLY TALKING PAST EACH OTHER

Krauthammer said people have told him they feel ""lost"" without his father, who died in 2018 at the age of 68 after a battle with cancer.

He said his father would always go to the core of a political issue and opine without regard to a particular party or ideology, but through a few basic principles.

His father, he said, strived to be truthful, without ""pulling punches,"" or ""shaping his opinions just to please someone or please public opinion.""

To that extent, Baier noted then-candidate Donald Trump had an up-and-down relationship with the elder Krauthammer.

In June 2017, Trump called the late columnist ""highly overrated pundit.""

TRUMP SAYS PELOSI SHOULD INVESTIGATE OBAMA'S SYRIA RED LINE

""As far as Charles Krauthammer, I'm not a fan of his,"" Trump told Fox & Friends at the time.

However, in another interview with Baier, he thanked Krauthammer for putting 'money' on him during ""Special Report's"" Candidate Casino.

""I saw that -- I couldn't believe it. Thank you Charles, I'm going to make you look good, Charles,"" Trump said.

In response, Daniel Krauthammer told Baier those two exchanges validated the way his father viewed politics and politicians.

""My father really -- as he said many times -- his job was to call a folly a folly, and it didn't matter which side that was on,"" he said.

""And he certainly called out President Trump many times for those follies... but he also saw overreactions on the other side.

""He separated out what was real policy difference that's valid and should be met that way, and things that really were beyond the pale and really should be criticized.""

Krauthammer remarked Trump's responses in those interviews also showed people, ""never knew where my dad was going to land on a certain issue.""

He added his father would likely continue that practice in the present, shying away from attacking politicians' character and instead trying to have a debate on the issues.

Warren, one of the leading Democrats seeking to unseat President Trump in 2020, spoke to reporters Monday after an event at Roosevelt High school in Des Moines, Iowa, when the topic of “Medicare-for-all” was raised.

During the media gaggle, Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked Warren: “How should caucus-goers be confident it is possible to pay for 'Medicare-for-all’ at all if the leading Democratic candidate still needs a few more weeks to tell them how it is going to get paid for?”

In response, Warren replied: “Well, why don’t you ask me that when the plan is out.”

POLL: VOTERS OPPOSE 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' SYSTEM THAT ELIMINATES PRIVATE INSURANCE

She did not give any further details.

Warren has been criticized in recent weeks for not explaining exactly how she would cover the costs for her ambitious plan, with two fellow 2020 contenders taking issue with her during last week’s debate.

After being asked by the moderators early at the fourth-round debate in Ohio last Tuesday whether middle-class taxes would rise under her health0care proposal, the progressive senator didn’t specifically answer, instead pledging, “I will not sign a bill into law that does not cut costs for middle-class families.”

Moments later, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg took aim at Warren, who’s soared in polling in recent months and has been considered a frontrunner for the party's presidential nomination alongside former Vice President Joe Biden.

ELIZABETH WARREN APPARENTLY SCRUBS DNA-TEST ROLLOUT FROM CAMPAIGN SITE, TWITTER

Accusing Warren of being evasive, Buttigieg argued, “Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything— except for this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multitrillion-dollar hole in this 'Medicare-for-all’ plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.”

Warren, firing back at Buttigieg, said: “Let’s be clear, whenever someone hears the term 'Medicare for all who want it,’ understand what that means: It’s 'Medicare for all who can afford it,’ and that’s the problem we’ve got. 'Medicare-for-all’ is the gold standard.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar then joined Buttigieg in calling out Warren.

The Minnesota Democrat said, “At least [Bernie Sanders is] being honest here in saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes will go up, and I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.”

Suggesting that Warren would never be able to pass her 'Medicare-for-all’ plan through Congress, Klobuchar said: “The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done.”

Biden also chimed in, jabbing at Warren without naming her, accusing her of not being straightforward.

“On the single most important thing facing the American public, I think it’s awfully important to be straightforward with them,” Biden noted. “The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget.”

Clearly the polls say Americans want to feel like they are part of the team. Inclusive. A musical montage from a teen movie where everyone chips in and they save the day. But don’t be fooled: These candidates are not like you, and the policies they support are actually bad for regular Americans. In fact, their slogans should all be the same: ""Do as I say, not as I do.""

Nowhere is this more obvious than when it comes to being green.

TUCKER CARLSON: POLS WHO USE KIDS TO GAIN POWER MAY BE A GREATER 'EXISTENTIAL THREAT' THAN CLIMATE CHANGE?

As part of their required Federal Election Commission quarterly filings, the candidates disclosed how their finances and each campaign have been spending a lot of money on private jet travel. After all, how else does one get from Iowa to New Hampshire? In coach? Taking off shoes at TSA? With campaign donations picking up the tab, private jets make the campaign trail much better.

For a collective group of Democrats who decry fossil fuels, who embrace the radical Green New Deal, who demand we change our habits and diets to reflect the “existential crisis” of climate change, they sure don’t put their campaign money with their mouth is.

Every one of the 2020 candidates supports the Green New Deal (GND) as part of their campaign, and as a reminder, this radical, socialist proposal of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez seeks to make air travel ""obsolete."" Air travel is such a no-no amongst environmentalists that ""flight shaming"" has become a common tactic the green radicals use.

So, why do these candidates get a pass? If they want us to stop flying commercial, why are they justified in flying private?

The Buttigieg campaign said it needs private jets because South Bend isn't convenient to campaign stops and the mayor has a vigorous schedule. Here’s a question for Mayor Pete: If I live in rural America and am busy, can I get an exemption under the Green New Deal you support?

We all know the answer to that question, plebeian.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., say their flights are actually ""carbon neutral"" because they buy carbon offsets, presumably with campaign contributions. That's like justifying a cheesecake for dinner by purchasing my neighbor a treadmill. For his dog. And the treadmill company donates to my campaign. Yet, in the silly and slimy world of D.C. politics and sympathetic press, somehow that excuse evens out.

All these candidates are too cowardly to admit what we all know: They travel on private jets because they can. Playing us for fools just adds insult to injury.

Their private air travel is possible for one reason, and one reason alone: America is great. Right now, there are millions of Americans in rural places like Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, and Artesia, New Mexico, working in the energy industry. These are the men and women who power America doing hard, difficult, even dangerous work, and we all benefit from the fruit of their labor.

We have an incredible amount of oil and gas reserves across this nation, and many are still yet untapped. Our abundant energy means prices are low. A decade ago, oil consistently hovered around $100 a barrel. Today, it is half that. This means cheaper gas and home utility bills. Information technology is reflected in the manufacturing and shipping costs of consumer goods. Abundant energy means we spend less. This is something we should celebrate.

What happens when the Green New Deal does make air travel ""obsolete"" and the 10 million American jobs in the airline industry are lost? What happens when Sanders gets his wish to make fracking illegal by executive order and consequently half our oil and two-thirds our gas comes off the market?

I’ll tell you what happens: You won't fly home for Christmas. You won't buy fruit in winter. Cold weather and athletic clothing with lycra and Core-Tex and nylon won’t be affordable. Food prices will skyrocket. Shipping costs will make European goods unaffordable, and speaking of Europe, forget about going. You can't afford it, because with oil around $200 a barrel, even a cruise is out of the question.

What happens when politicians destroy the fossil fuel industry is, they destroy the economy and our way of life.

Next time you see a candidate in a stump speech decrying climate change, demanding a Green New Deal, even calling energy industry workers ""Criminals,"" just ask a simple question: Will you, candidate, stop using these fossil fuels, the cheap gas, the plastics, the oil, the private jets, in your campaign?

We all know the answer to that, plebeian.

Any candidate who does not live in his private life what he wants government to mandate you live in yours is not worthy of your vote to elected office. And none of these hypocrites is worthy to be your president.

BUTTI-BOOM REDUX

USA Today: “It's a new three-way race in Iowa. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who was initially seen as a long-shot presidential contender, has surged within striking distance of former vice president Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses, a Suffolk University/USA TODAY Poll finds. … The poll, taken Wednesday through Friday, put Biden at 18%, Warren at 17% and Buttigieg at 13% among 500 likely Democratic caucusgoers. Those standings reflect significant changes since the Suffolk/USA TODAY poll taken in Iowa at the end of June, when Biden led Warren by double digits and Buttigieg trailed at a distant 6%. California Sen. Kamala Harris, who was then in second place after a strong showing in the first Democratic debate, has plummeted 13 percentage points and is now in a three-way tie for sixth. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders earned 9% support, the same number as in the June poll.”



Buttigieg, Klobuchar try to capitalize - Politico: “Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar shot out of the last Democratic debate with the most precious commodity a presidential candidate can get before the Iowa caucuses: momentum. … The new round of attention for both Midwesterners comes at a key moment: Klobuchar has yet to qualify for the November debate stage, while Buttigieg faced new questions about his campaign’s attention to racial issues. And both of them still have significant ground to make up in the polls. … Based on money and staff footprint, Buttigieg is better positioned: He ended September with $23.4 million in his campaign account — third in the Democratic field — while Klobuchar has $3.7 million to spend. She’s only reached 3 percent in one early-state poll, and she needs three more to qualify for the November debate. On the ground in Iowa, Buttigieg’s staff is about double the size of Klobuchar’s. Both candidates are currently airing TV ads in Iowa.”



Are Dems ready for a Midwest moment? - LAT: “Both long shots are now trying — with swings through early-voting states, new ads and endorsements, and intensified fundraising efforts — to keep their post-debate sizzle hot and find an opening in the contest that has been shaping up as a showdown between Biden and Warren. In the process, they are surfacing a long-simmering debate about the dominance of the party’s liberal wing on the East and West coasts — making a more pointed case than Biden, whose campaign pitch builds on his experience more than ideology. ‘It’s the Midwest versus the rest of the country,’ said Rufus Gifford, who was finance director of President Obama’s reelection campaign in 2012 and is uncommitted in the 2020 race. ‘Both Pete and Amy really focused on the fact that this is the part of the country we need to win, and we are losing.’”



Klobuchar says she’s peaking at the right time - WaPo: “Klobuchar, who struggled for attention in the Democratic primary, says this week's debate helped her catch on at exactly the right time. Her town halls are crowded, with staffers running to get more chairs to pack breweries or event centers. She leads the field in local endorsements, especially state legislators, ‘with more to come,’ she says. She kicked off her bus tour with the support of Andy McKean, a Republican state legislator who bolted his party six months ago and who pronounced Klobuchar the kind of Democrat who could unite America again. ‘If you want to peak in this race,’ she said after a stop in Waterloo, ‘you want to peak now, instead of six months before [the caucuses].’ A few other candidates still draw larger crowds, but Klobuchar is going for a particular kind of caucus-goer: the loyal Democrat who wants to win back those mysterious Trump voters.”



Zuckerberg gave hiring recommendations to Buttigieg campaign - Bloomberg: “Facebook Inc. chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has privately recommended several potential hires to Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign, a rare example of direct political involvement from one of tech’s most powerful executives. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg sent multiple emails to Mike Schmuhl, Buttigieg’s campaign manager, with names of individuals that he might consider hiring, campaign spokesman Chris Meagher confirmed. Priscilla Chan, Zuckerberg’s wife, also sent multiple emails to Schmuhl with staff recommendations. Ultimately, two of the people recommended were hired.”



WARREN SCRAMBLES ON HEALTH INSURANCE

Fox News: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Sunday that in the upcoming weeks she would detail how to pay for her proposal for a government-run ‘Medicare-for-all’ plan. The Massachusetts Democrat and White House candidate said at a town hall in Indianola, Iowa: ‘What I see … is that we need to talk about the cost, and I plan over the next few weeks to put out a plan that talks about specifically the cost of ‘Medicare-for-all,’ and specifically how we pay for it.’ Estimates place the 10-year cost of the ‘Medicare-for-all’ plans at $32-34 trillion. She added about the universal health insurance plan: ‘This is something I’ve been working on for months and months, and it’s got just a little more work until it’s finished.’”



Gabbard uses Hillary in bid for relevancy - Fox News: “Speaking directly to the camera in a video message posted on social media on Sunday, 2020 presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard suggested that Hillary Clinton recently ‘smeared’ her as a ‘Russian asset’ as payback for Gabbard's defiance of the party establishment in 2016. … [In the video Gabbard said,] ‘If you stand up to Hillary and the party power brokers -- if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message. But, here is the truth: They will not intimidate us. They will not silence us.’ … Several candidates, including Beto O'Rourke, Andrew Yang and Marianne Williamson, have criticized Clinton's unfounded suggestion that Russians have been ‘grooming’ Gabbard to be a third-party spoiler in the race.”

TIME OUT: FROM WAY BACK WHEN

AP: “A crew of deep-sea explorers and historians looking for lost World War II warships have found a second Japanese aircraft carrier that went down in the historic Battle of Midway. Vulcan Inc.’s director of undersea operations Rob Kraft and Naval History and Heritage Command historian Frank Thompson reviewed high frequency sonar images of the warship Sunday and say that its dimensions and location mean it has to be the carrier Akagi. The Akagi was found in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument resting in nearly 18,000 feet (5,490 meters) of water more than 1,300 miles (2,090 kilometers) northwest of Pearl Harbor. The researchers used an autonomous underwater vehicle, or AUV, equipped with sonar to find the ship. The vehicle had been out overnight collecting data, and the image of a warship appeared in the first set of readings Sunday morning.”

MULVANEY AGONISTES

Politico: “Mick Mulvaney’s week went from bad to worse on Sunday, as he again tried to explain why President Donald Trump and the administration had withheld aid to Ukraine for weeks — one of Democrats’ central questions in their impeachment inquiry. Mulvaney fumbled during an interview on ‘Fox News Sunday’ when he cited two reasons for the delay, whereas he had listed three during his Thursday news briefing at the White House. He continued to blame reporters for any misunderstanding, a feat that can be tough to pull off when his answers were all delivered on camera and when the host, Chris Wallace, let the tape keep rolling. And he threw red meat to liberals and Democratic presidential candidates who have long questioned the appropriateness of the Trump family continuing to profit from their business holdings while Trump serves as president. … Mulvaney’s interview did not play well among Trump allies and advisers, with one calling it a ‘self-immolation.’”



Party support for Trump gets tested - WSJ: “President Trump faces increasing public and private scrutiny from his own party over a series of recent White House moves, as the House impeachment inquiry reduces his margin for error with fellow Republicans and makes him more vulnerable to attacks. In the past several days, Mr. Trump has been forced to drop plans to host next year’s Group of Seven summit at his Doral golf resort, and a top aide has tried to walk back comments linking Ukraine military aid to an investigation of the president’s political opponents. The fallout of Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria has continued to draw widespread criticism, including from Republicans. Mr. Trump’s support within his party will face fresh tests this week, as key witnesses from the State Department and Pentagon are expected to testify in closed hearings before a trio of House committees on the president’s dealings with Ukraine.”



Continetti: Trump fatigue syndrome - National Review: “I was surprised to read Robert J. Samuelson’s column in the Washington Post arguing for the impeachment and removal of President Trump. Samuelson is, above all, a realist who has looked on economics and politics with a tough and somewhat cynical eye for some 30 years. … Samuelson has reached his breaking point. And he isn’t alone. A large part of the country suffers from Trump Fatigue Syndrome. This is related but not identical to Trump Derangement Syndrome. The sufferers of Trump Fatigue aren’t driven mad by the president. They are just tired of having to wake up every morning to another of his sudden attacks, reversals, exaggerations, and boasts. They want the show to end.”



Dems ready more witnesses for impeachment probe - Reuters: “Democrats on Monday laid out their case for the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump and pressed Republicans to stop supporting Trump by releasing a fact sheet and video they said expose Trump’s efforts to secure victory in the 2020 presidential election with the assistance of Ukraine. The releases ‘encapsulate all the evidence uncovered to date about the president’s months-long pressure campaign to undermine the 2020 election and the extent to which he abused his power by using the levers of government to advance the scheme,’ according to the office of Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives. They also showed how Democrats may approach the charges, or articles of impeachment, they are expected to draw up at the conclusion of the probe. The articles of impeachment, if approved by the House, would then be sent to Senate for a trial on whether to remove Trump from office.”



TRUMP OVERWHELMS DEMS ON SOCIAL MEDIA

NYT: “That campaigns are now being fought largely online is hardly a revelation, yet only one political party seems to have gotten the message. While the Trump campaign has put its digital operation firmly at the center of the president’s re-election effort, Democrats are struggling to internalize the lessons of the 2016 race and adapt to a political landscape shaped by social media. Mr. Trump’s first campaign took far better advantage of Facebook and other platforms that reward narrowly targeted — and, arguably, nastier — messages. And while the president is now embattled on multiple fronts and disfavored by a majority of Americans in most polls, he has one big advantage: His 2020 campaign, flush with cash, is poised to dominate online again, according to experts on both ends of the political spectrum, independent researchers and tech executives. The difference between the parties’ digital efforts, they said, runs far deeper than the distinction between an incumbent’s general-election operation and challengers’ primary campaigns.”



Dems also worry about Trump’s money machine - Politico: “Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee have raised more than $300 million this year for his reelection — more than any other sitting president in history at this point in the campaign. Trump has nearly twice as much cash on hand — $158 million, between his campaign account and the RNC — as Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee had at this time in his successful re-election run. … Democrats, meanwhile, are still four or five months away — at the earliest — from settling on a nominee. ‘We don’t know if the Democratic candidate is going to be able to even compete with such a shorter timeline, even if they have significant resources after the convention,’ said Tara McGowan, founder and chief executive officer of the progressive group ACRONYM. With the Democratic primary in full swing, McGowan said, ‘There’s two separate elections going on, and the really unfortunate part is Trump is the only one involved in the general election today.’”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I've a sad sense of déjà vu: 2020 is shaping up to be another election which leaves no major candidate for whom I can vote. As a conservative, I had serious concerns about Trump's temperament but was long done with the Clintons’ modus operandi. Now I face a similar situation: Vote for someone who, against all military advice and in one stroke, abruptly abandoned allies in the field to danger and death and diminished (if not killed outright) our chances of creating such alliances in the future, or vote for a socialist. As for David Brooks ‘policies can be argued about and reversed,’ in what world? I can think of quite a few bad policies that have never been reversed, amended or fixed because once created, they spawn dependent bureaucracies and constituencies. Attempt to touch them and you'll meet Paul Ryan's fate. Worse, voting for a Democrat lends legitimacy to the vicious, hateful behavior displayed toward Brett Kavanaugh and the underhanded, partisan impeachment inquiry. (Impeachment is a political process, but as you've pointed out, it wasn't intended to be a partisan one.) Many Republican Senators might prefer to remove him, have Pence and peace and be done with it. (Sounds good to me.) But how many will be able to bring themselves to vote for removal, thereby legitimizing a process that locked out their House counterparts? It's growing very grey days in voter land.” – Triche Osborne, Baton Rouge, La.



[Ed. note: I hear you! Another few weeks like the ones we’ve had and I may seek out an island in the Aleutians to live out my days with the polar bears. But… We are very privileged to be alive in this moment. Life, especially as free people, is always a privilege, but how lucky are we to be alive at a moment when America, the West, and really, our whole species is fundamentally re-evaluating what it’s all about. I choose not to despair because history tells me that we will figure it out. Maybe not in a straight line, but we will get there. I base this not on the fact that there is an arc to history (there isn’t) but rather because we have all of the necessary ingredients to make what comes next freer, fairer and more dedicated the American creed.]



“As you note, there are many indicators supporting your observation that we are in the midst of enormous societal and hence political change. But I would dispute your conclusion that no politician is addressing this change. Andrew Yang had built his campaign explicitly around this change which he believes will accelerate over the next two decades. I am disappointed that you and the rest of the political press have paid so little attention. You may well not agree with his prescriptions, but he has clearly diagnosed the disease and deserves serious consideration. In the last debate, I was struck by his quiet observation about Sweden's wealth tax proposal - it has been tried by several other developed nations and failed - adding - why can't we learn from the experience of others?” – Matt Lincoln, Portola Valley, Calif.



[Ed. note: Yang may be prescient, Mr. Lincoln, but he also is a pessimist. One of the reasons he has connected so well with younger males is that he matches the sense of foreboding common among many millennial dudes. I do grant you that he is one of the few candidates who is even talking about this Gutenberg-level (Johannes not Steve) disruption that’s working its way through our society. I wish politicians in both parties would think about the same stuff.]



“Well I live in the UK and I am 72 years old, but I watch and read Fox News every day without fail… Before Trump decided to run for President I loved this man to death, he is just what I wanted to see in a President of the USA. Today at times I cringe when Trump opens his mouth or goes off on one on Twitter, he is the making of all his problems to date… Now I want Trump to get a 2nd term but he must CONTROL his mouth and have more respect for people who he talks to after all this is the most powerful man on planet Earth…” – Michael O'Connor, West Yorkshire, England

AP: “A BASE jumper who jumped illegally from a northwestern Wisconsin cellphone tower ended up calling the police on himself after his parachute became caught on a guy wire, leaving him dangling perilously 50 feet (15 meters) from the ground. Police say the 20-year-old man jumped from the 300-foot (90-meter) Charter Communications tower in Menomonie on Thursday morning. After his rescue at around 9:30 a.m., the man was treated at Mayo Clinic Health System and arrested for criminal trespass. BASE jumping stands for building, antenna, span and earth — the four common objects from which BASE jumpers launch their descent.”

The book, titled ""A WARNING,"" comes roughly a year after the senior official laid out his scathing attack. According to the publisher, the book will be released on Nov. 19 and pick up where the controversial op-ed left off.

""This explosive book offers a shocking, first-hand account of President Trump and his record,"" the publisher said on Tuesday.

Javelin's Matt Latimer and Keith Urbahn, both of whom represented former FBI Director James Comey on his book, are working with the author, whose identity is still unknown to the public.

The release is sure to spark yet another political firestorm in the nation, as the initial op-ed prompted intense media coverage and vehement denunciations from the White House.

WH OFFICIAL PENS ANONYMOUS NY TIMES OP-ED CALLING TRUMP 'ANTI-DEMOCRATIC,' 'PETTY AND INEFFECTIVE'

Titled ""I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration,"" the op-ed --which was published Sept. 5, 2018--revealed that the author and others in the administration wanted to undermine Trump's agenda. While the author distances themselves from the popular ""resistance"" movement, they also asserted that thwarting Trump was vital to the health of the nation.

""We believe our first duty is to this country, and the president continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our republic,"" the official said in the op-ed.

The op-ed took particular aim at the president's behavior, claiming he was ""erratic"" and had a fundamental ""amorality"" that plagued his administration.

""Anyone who works with him knows he is not moored to any discernible first principles that guide his decision making,"" it read.

Then-White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders responded by blasting the author's cowardice and calling on them to resign. It's unclear whether the official is still in the administration, but the book's release was the latest indication that Trump faced concerted opposition from within his own ranks.

""I think that there are nefarious actors all around us and people who work within the administration that hate the president. And those people should just decide to go somewhere else,"" Reince Priebus, former White House chief of staff, told Fox News on Tuesday.

Priebus said he had a ""few guesses"" on who he thought the author was and predicted their identity wouldn't remain a secret for much longer.

MATTIS DERIDES 'COWARDICE' FROM ANONYMOUS OFFICIAL WHO PENNED NEW YORK TIMES' ANTI-TRUMP OP-ED

""If someone comes out with a book and puts themselves in scenarios and situations, I think it's going to be rooted out pretty quickly who this person is,"" he said.

Latimer claimed that the author felt their identity was ""irrelevant.""

“The author feels their identity is almost irrelevant because there is scarcely a sentiment expressed in this book that is not shared by numerous others who have served and continue to serve this administration at its highest levels,"" Latimer said, according to The Washington Post.

As Latimer mentioned, the author didn't get an advance for the book. According to Twelve's release, they also pledged to donate royalties to non-profits that ""focus on government accountability and on supporting those who stand up for the truth in repressive countries around the world.""

Latimer also relayed that his client saw publishing the book as ""an act of conscience and of duty."""
531,Tyler Olson,"The Republican Study Committee released a healthcare plan Tuesday to replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, two years after the GOP was unable to agree on a health care plan during the first year of President Trump's administration.
The pl… [+4268 chars]",The GOP plan comes after Republicans were unable to agree on an option to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act while they held both the House and the Senate during the first two years of President Trump's administration.,2019-10-22,Fox News,House Republicans release plan in bid to fulfill Trump promise as 'party of health care',https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-release-healthcare-plan-in-effort-to-fulfill-trump-promise-as-the-party-of-healthcare,"The Republican Study Committee released a healthcare plan Tuesday to replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, two years after the GOP was unable to agree on a health care plan during the first year of President Trump's administration.

The plan also represents an effort to compete with Democrats' messaging on ""Medicare-for-All"" and other health care plans as the 2020 Democratic primary campaign hits its stride.

The 66-page framework seeks to ""transform the individual marketplace's current regulatory structure, unwind the ACA's Washington-centric approach and largely return regulatory authority to individual states.""

This includes provisions to increase the portability of health insurance within the individual marketplace, provide federal funding for state-designed ""guaranteed coverage pools"" which would help cover individuals with pre-existing conditions -- though it does not require states to run such pools -- put a moratorium on Medicaid expansions so it can be ""sustainable ... for generations to come"" and promotes ""innovative care"" such as telemedicine.

""It is a plan that: PROTECTS the vulnerable,"" a statement attached to the plan says, ""especially those with pre-existing conditions; EMPOWERS individuals with greater control over their health care choices and dollars; and PERSONALIZES health care to meet individual needs and reduce premiums, deductibles, and the overall cost of health care.""

2020 PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL SAYS ELIZABETH WARREN IS LYING ABOUT HER HEALTHCARE PLAN: 'IT'S A SOUNDBITE'

Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., Rep. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz. Rep. Larry Buchshon, R-Ind., Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa. Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., Rep John Joyce, R-Pa., Rep. David Rouzer, R-N.C. and Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas all signed the document.

The health care portability provision, specifically, would extend similar protections to those moving from individual plan to individual plan as currently exist for those between employer-sponsored insurance plans. This, the framework's authors say, would prevent patients from being denied coverage while moving between individual plans, for example, while moving to a different state.

The RSC's document, which is not a bill but rather a list of ideas the RSC says will be hashed out through debate, also includes increased limits on health savings accounts. The RSC proposes uncoupling health savings accounts from high-deductible plans and raising the cap on such accounts to $9,000 for individuals and $18,000 for families, more than double what is allowed under current law.

The RSC framework does add one caveat to the use of health savings accounts, however.

SANDERS ACCUSES BIDEN OF PUSHING INSURANCE INDUSTRY 'TALKING POINTS' BY SLAMMING 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

""Critically, while the RSC plan would unleash health savings accounts, it would ensure that these accounts are pro-life and do not inadvertently allow a back-door method of subsidizing abortion procedures,"" the plan reads. ""Accordingly, the RSC plan would ensure these accounts cannot be linked to a plan that provides abortions, nor would abortions or abortion drugs be an eligible expense.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed the RSC's ideas, criticizing Republicans for not bringing Democrats into the fold on their plans to replace the Affordable Care Act.

""After 10 years of refusing to work with Democrats to #ProtectOurCare, the only plans offered by Republicans don’t cover & protect preexisting conditions,"" she tweeted Tuesday. ""They say their plan is an alternative to the Affordable Care Act but it’s really just an alternative to health care, period.""

The conservative organization Freedomworks, on the other hand, released a statement in support of the RSC's proposal, saying it would improve health care for consumers while also sticking to small-government principles.

“We’re thrilled to see a coalition in Congress with a health care plan that is based around individual choice and ownership of health insurance,"" Jason Pye, FreedomWorks Vice President of Legislative Affairs, said. ""The RSC plan also respects federalism by allowing states to decide how best to extend affordable coverage for their residents.

“From the large expansion of health savings accounts to the elimination of many provisions of current law that have made health insurance coverage so unaffordable, Americans across the country will benefit from the choice afforded to them by this plan."""

DEM ELITES SEARCHING FOR WHITE KNIGHT

NYT: “When a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered at the Whitby Hotel in Manhattan last week, the dinner began with a discussion of which presidential candidates the contributors liked. But as conversations among influential Democrats often go these days, the meeting quickly evolved into a discussion of who was not in the race — but could be lured in. Would Hillary Clinton get in, the contributors wondered, and how about Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor? One person even mused whether Michelle Obama would consider a late entry, according to two people who attended the event, which was hosted by the progressive group American Bridge. It’s that time of the election season for Democrats. ‘Since the last debate, just anecdotally, I’ve had five or six people ask me: ‘Is there anybody else?’ said Leah Daughtry, a longtime Democrat who has run two of the party’s recent conventions.”

Warren ups the ante another $800 billion - WSJ: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for $800 billion in additional federal funding for public education, a move that would exhaust the remaining revenue to be raised by her proposed wealth tax even as she seeks ways to finance Medicare for All. Ms. Warren outlined on the blog site Medium an additional $450 billion in Title I funding to boost schools with low-income students, $200 billion in grants for students with disabilities and $100 billion in other grants over 10 years. She also vowed to invest $50 billion in school infrastructure on top of existing funding for school upgrades that are in some of her other policy proposals.”



Castro promises to quit if he can’t raise $800,000 in 10 days - Politico: “Julián Castro on Monday threatened to suspend his presidential bid unless he can raise nearly $1 million by the end of the month. ‘If I can’t raise $800,000 in the next 10 days — I will have no choice but to end my race for president,’ Castro wrote in a fundraising email to supporters. ‘If I don’t meet this deadline, I won’t have the resources to keep my campaign running.’ The strategy is nearly identical to Cory Booker’s ‘radical transparency’ gambit last month, when his campaign warned in a memo to supporters that the New Jersey senator would end his White House bid if he was unable to raise $1.7 million in the final 10 days of September.”



Buttigieg’s sexuality a hurdle with black voters - The [Columbia, S.C.] State: “Internal focus groups conducted by Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign this summer reveal a key reason why he is struggling with African-American voters: many see his sexuality as a problem. The 21-page report, conducted by the Benenson Strategy Group with black Democratic South Carolina voters in mid-July and obtained exclusively by McClatchy, found that ‘being gay was a barrier for these voters, particularly for the men who seemed deeply uncomfortable even discussing it. … [T]heir preference is for his sexuality to not be front and center. While the report stated that Buttigieg’s sexuality was not a ‘disqualifier’ for these voters, some of the focus group participants questioned why Buttigieg even brought it up.’



Facebook ramps up election security efforts ahead of 2020 - AP: “With just over a year left until the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Facebook is stepping up its efforts to ensure it is not used as a tool to interfere in politics and democracies around the world. The efforts include a special security tool for elected officials and candidates that monitors them for hacking attempts. Facebook said Monday it will also label state-controlled media as such, label fact-checks more clearly and invest $2 million in media literacy projects. The company says it will add more prominent labels on debunked posts on Facebook as well as on Instagram. It will put labels on top of what are deemed ‘false’ and ‘partly false’ photos and videos.”



THE RULEBOOK: OF NOTE

“Every candid reader will make the proper reflections on these important facts.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 38



TIME OUT: ‘EVERYONE’S GOT THEIR THING’

NYT: “The pressures of sexual selection have made peacocks gorgeous, wood thrushes sonorous and birds of paradise great dancers. At first glance, the white bellbird doesn’t appear to have benefited similarly. Barrel-chested and big-mouthed, with a long wattle dangling from the top of its beak, this rainforest bird looks more like a Muppet than an avian Casanova. But everyone’s got their thing. According to a paper published Monday in Current Biology, this goofball boasts the loudest birdsong ever recorded. And he must be proud of it, because he sings the most piercing note right into potential mates’ faces. The white bellbird — one of four bellbird species in South and Central America — is a favorite among birders in Brazil. It has a ‘strange, metallic, kind of alien call,’ said Caio Brito, one of the founders of Brazil Birding Experts. When several sing at once, they are ‘deafening,’ and sound like ‘several blacksmiths trying to compete,’ said Arthur Gomes, a biology student at São Paulo State University who contributed to the new research.”

IMPEACHMENT TIMING GETS TRICKIER FOR HOUSE DEMS

NYT: “House Democrats have resigned themselves to the likelihood that impeachment proceedings against President Trump will extend into the Christmas season, as they plan a series of public hearings intended to make the simplest and most devastating possible public case in favor of removing Mr. Trump. Democratic leaders had hoped to move as soon as Thanksgiving to wrap up a narrow inquiry focused around Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine, buoyed by polling data that shows that the public supports the investigation, even if voters are not yet sold on impeaching the president. But after a complicated web of damaging revelations about the president has emerged from private depositions unfolding behind closed doors, Democratic leaders have now begun plotting a full-scale — and probably more time-consuming — effort to lay out their case in a set of high-profile public hearings on Capitol Hill.”



Diplomat who raised red flag on Giuliani-Trump deal testifies today - Reuters: “William Taylor, a former Army officer and career U.S. diplomat now leading the U.S. embassy in Kiev, will be the latest in a series of current and former officials to meet behind closed doors with the Democratic-led House of Representatives Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight Committees in the month since the probe began. Committee members and staff are examining whether the Republican Trump abused his office by improperly putting pressure on Ukraine to launch an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival and leading candidate for the Democratic 2020 presidential nomination. Taylor’s testimony is of particular interest to investigators because of his leading role at the embassy in Ukraine. He raised concern about military assistance being withheld from Kiev to put pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.”



Schiff un-censured - Fox News: “The Democratic-led House of Representatives voted Monday evening to table, or set aside, a resolution to censure House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., for his handling of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. The vote was 218 to 185 to table the resolution, which the Republican minority had introduced. All Democrats voted to table the censure resolution, with all Republicans voting against tabling. Independent Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, who left the Republican Party earlier this year, voted to table the resolution.”



President Trump draws ire of black lawmakers for ‘lynching’ claim - AP: “President Donald Trump enraged Democrats on Tuesday by comparing their impeachment inquiry to a lynching, assigning the horrors of a deadly and racist chapter in U.S. history to a process laid out in the Constitution. ‘That is one word no president ought to apply to himself,’ said Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the highest-ranking African American in Congress. ‘That is a word that we ought to be very, very careful about using’ he said. Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., called on Trump to delete the tweet.”



MICK MULVANEY: KICKING GAFFES AND TAKING NAMES

Reuters: “U.S. President Donald Trump has been fielding suggestions from allies on who might succeed his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, amid frustration at his team’s response to the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, two sources close to the White House said on Monday. Trump’s irritation at being dogged by a variety of issues - from impeachment to his decision to move U.S. troops out of northeastern Syria - was on display on Monday in the White House Cabinet Room as the president aired his grievances at length before his senior advisers and a group of reporters. The president has been focused in part on Mulvaney’s comments to reporters last week that Trump had withheld military aid from Ukraine in an effort to get Kiev to investigate a debunked claim about the 2016 U.S. election.”



Cuccinelli blocked from DHS job - AP: “President Donald Trump has been notified by his staff that he can’t select two popular figures — Ken Cuccinelli and Mark Morgan — to serve as an acting secretary of homeland security because a federal law governing agency succession makes them ineligible. Instead, Sean Doocey, the White House director of presidential personnel, in recent days gave Trump a list of other officials to consider as acting secretary, including top DHS official Chad Wolf and Transportation Security Administration chief David Pekoske, according to three people familiar with the conversation. The news has infuriated immigration hawks inside and outside the administration who had been lobbying for Cuccinelli to fill the role and now fear Trump will tap Wolf, a former chief of staff to ousted DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen who once worked as a lobbyist on employment visas.”



TRUMP LOOKS SOUTH FOR A BOOST

Politico: “Donald Trump is going all-in on a trio of Southern governor’s races in November, gambling that a clean sweep will help him regain his political footing at the most perilous moment of his presidency. Trump is expected to barnstorm Kentucky, Mississippi, and Louisiana over the next few weeks, while dispatching prominent supporters to help in each contest. And Vice President Mike Pence is planning a bus tour through eastern Kentucky, a pivotal area on the state’s political map that could decide the fate of Republican Gov. Matt Bevin. Trump badly needs a boost right now, and the White House sees the elections in the conservative states as the best near-term hope of achieving it.”



Impeachment adds windage to Kentucky contest - WSJ: “The gubernatorial election in Kentucky next month hinges in large part on whether voters are motivated by bread-and-butter issues close to home or national politics supercharged by the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. It is one of three governor’s races this year, along with those in Louisiana and Mississippi, that can offer insights on the electorate’s mood ahead of the 2020 presidential election.”

[Ed. note: You will be so glad you did! “Opinions are luxury items” is a close cousin to one of my dad’s favorites: “You can be happy or you can be right, but not usually both.” In our relationships it matters so much more that we listen and really hear each other. The simple but always challenging act of loving our neighbors starts by talking with them, which can’t happen if we’re talking at them. This not only makes us happier people and better friends, spouses and parents it also lets us save our strongest defenses for the things that matter the most.]

PICTURE DAY IS THE WURST

WSVN: “A 4th grader had a unique outfit for his school photo. Craig Arsenault posted a photo of his son Jake’s school ID. For his school photo, Jake dressed up in a hot dog costume. ‘My wife and I dared our son to wear a hot dog costume for school pictures. The school let him do it, and I couldn’t be happier,’ Arsenault said. According to Fox 13, Arsenault said the family had the costume “laying around for (the) last year,” and the idea came up when Jake voiced his wonder about what to wear for his school photo. ‘My wife suggested the hot dog costume. He was hesitant, so we bet him 10 bucks he wouldn’t do it,’ the father said. However, Jake accepted the dare and donned the costume for his photo. … Arsenault said he only had $7 at the time, which he gave to his son, but his son is holding him to the other $3.”

* With only two weeks remaining in Kentucky’s gubernatorial race, William Woods, a Republican who ran against Gov. Matt Bevin in a GOP primary, this week announced his support for the governor’s Democratic challenger, state Attorney General Andy Beshear (D). “This election isn’t about politics for me,” Woods said on Monday night. “I’m ready for a governor who will respect all of us regardless of political affiliation.”

* Kansas Democrats’ U.S. Senate primary got a little more straightforward a few days ago, when former U.S. Attorney Barry Grissom ended his campaign and endorsed state Sen. Barbara Bollier (D). Bollier is perhaps best known as the former Republican who left the party over its radicalism.

* And the Washington Post’s Eugene Scott noted late yesterday that while some of Rep. Tulsi Gabbard’s (D-Hawaii) 2020 rivals have defended her from claims that she’s a Russian asset, “some have argued that Gabbard doesn’t have to be proactively working with Russia for that government to be using her campaign to interfere in the 2020 election.”"

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for defending fellow 2020 candidate Tulsi Gabbard after Clinton suggested the Hawaii congresswoman is a Russian asset.

“Tulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country. People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset,” Sanders tweeted on Monday.

Adam Parkhomenko, a former Hillary Clinton staffer who bills himself as “one of the Democratic Party’s top grassroots organizers,” attacked Sanders for the tweet.

2020 DEMS DISMISS HILLARY CLINTON'S ATTACKS, RALLY TO TULSI GABBARD'S DEFENSE OVER RUSSIA ACCUSATION

“Bernie joins Trump and thousands of Russian bots in defending the person who blamed the US instead of Assad for gassing his own people. Not to mention his not so stellar voting record on Russian sanctions,” Parkhomenko wrote to his nearly 300,000 followers.

“F--k Bernie. I’d forgotten how much I despise that a--hole. Thanks for the reminder,” Parkhomenko added.

Someone responded to the foul-mouthed Parkhomenko, asking him how the rhetoric is productive.

HILLARY CLINTON FLOATS CONSPIRACY THAT TULSI GABBARD IS BEING 'GROOMED' BY RUSSIANS

“Yeah, let’s wait and talk about it next October. Or maybe we listen to the lady who was right about all of this s--- in ’16,” Parkhomenko shot back. “Sticking together is not s---ting on Hillary and ignoring her warnings.”

Parkhomenko is considered a Clinton superfan and The Washington Post ran a 2018 feature about Parkhomenko headlined, “Meet the Clinton staffer who has devoted his life to her cause. Will it be worth it?”

“[The Clinton] campaign knows it can trust Parkhomenko. They know he has dedicated much of his life, since age 17, to her ascent to the presidency. They know he put off college to work for her, then started the Ready for Hillary super PAC,” the Post wrote. “His fanaticism is a very practical kind. You might even call it . . . Clintonian.”

Appearing on former President Obama aide David Plouffe’s “Campaign HQ” podcast, Clinton did not mention Gabbard specifically by name, though Plouffe ended the podcast by noting Clinton’s “belief that Tulsi Gabbard is going to be a third-party candidate propped up by Trump and the Russians.”

“I'm not making any predictions but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,” Clinton said, in an apparent reference to Gabbard. “She's the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.”

Clinton’s podcast performance prompted Gabbard to respond forcefully on Twitter, calling her the “queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party.”

An increasing number of other 2020 Democratic candidates have also positioned themselves in Gabbard's camp, rejecting Clinton's claims, defending Gabbard and attempting to shift the conversation to other topics. Gabbard herself posted a video message over the weekend claiming Clinton’s accusation was simply payback for her defiance of the party establishment during the 2016 presidential election.

Parkhomenko is the president of the Renegade Group and co-founder of TRR Group, according to his personal website. He worked for Clinton during her failed 2016 campaign.

Bernie Sanders, condemned Clinton's unfounded suggestion that the congresswoman is a secret Russian asset.

Speaking to reporters at an Iowa coffee shop, Gabbard, D-Hawaii, lamented that Clinton had pulled out of a planned appearance at Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Summit, where Gabbard is set to speak. Clinton was said to have abandoned the summit to avoid appearing with former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

""Well, she had something to say about me, and I would have been very happy to have that conversation directly face-to-face with her,"" Gabbard said.

Earlier Monday, Sanders, I-Vt., joined fellow presidential candidates Andrew Yang, Marianne Williamson and Beto O'Rourke in defending Gabbard.

GABBARD REVEALS WHY SHE THINKS CLINTON IS 'SMEARING' HER

""Tulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country,"" Sanders tweeted, referring to Gabbard's overseas deployments. ""People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset.""

Asked for her reaction to Sanders' comment, Gabbard said only, ""Thank you for speaking the truth.""

Gabbard said she had not spoken with Sanders since last week's presidential primary debate.

TRUMP DEFENDS GABBARD, SUGGESTS CLINTON IS 'SICK'

In addition to suggesting Gabbard was a ""Russian asset"" in a recent interview, Clinton asserted, also without evidence, that Russians were ""grooming her to be the third-party candidate"" and spoiler in the 2020 race. Clinton hinted that Gabbard was the ""favorite of the Russians.""

But, Gabbard reiterated to reporters Monday that she would commit to voting for the Democrats' eventual nominee, and would not run as a third-party candidate.

""I've already said that many times,"" Gabbard said when asked if she'd stay with the Democrats instead of mounting a third-party bid.

Gabbard acknowledged that she had met with Trump when he was president-elect in order to discuss foreign policy, but insisted the discussions were not about any potential role in his administration. Gabbard also said she hadn't since talked to Trump about foreign policy.

""I was never offered a job,"" Gabbard said. That was not what is about. I was asked if I wanted to go and speak to the then-president-elect about foreign policy., and that's what I did.""

Also Monday, Trump sounded a note of empathy for Gabbard, saying he had some familiarity with being accused of Russian collaboration without any evidence.

'I said, wait a minute, it took me two-and-a-half years, I wish [Clinton] would have said that earlier because people... have realized she is crazy. She’s crazy,"" the president told Fox News' Sean Hannity.

""She's accusing everyone of being a Russian agent,"" Trump told reporters, referring to Clinton. ""She's not a Russian agent. These people are sick. There’s something wrong with them.""

Trump added that he thought Clinton's substance-free accusations against Gabbard ultimately would help his own political chances in 2020.

Gabbard has asserted that Clinton was targeting her because Gabbard ended her tenure as vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016 by quitting and throwing her support behind Sanders. At the time, Gabbard accused party leaders of stifling her freedom of speech and unfairly tipping the scales in favor of Clinton's presidential campaign.

""People warned me in 2016 that my endorsement of Bernie Sanders would be the end of my 'political career' -- they said Clinton would never forget,"" Gabbard said a video posted on Twitter on Sunday, ""that she and her rich and powerful friends -- her allies in politics and the media -- will make sure you're destroyed.""

""When you hear firsthand from people from Venezuela or Cuba who have dealt with socialism, who've been driven from their countries, who've dealt with the poverty and the instability it brings to their government, I think it really resonates. So we've launched VictimsOfSocialism.org so we can hear their stories firsthand and it is very powerful,"" RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said on ""Fox & Friends.""

The ""Victims of Socialism"" campaign features a montage, as well as individual videos, of several people warning about socialism after their home nation spun into civil and economic disarray. It's the result of a monthslong effort by the RNC to highlight the dangers that could result from Democratic victories in 2020.

""The American people need to protect the United States from the socialist politics,"" a man identified as Amed G. says in the video.

SANDERS EMBRACES DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM, CALLS FOR NEW DEAL REVIVAL IN CAMPAIGN ADDRESS

""It's crazy. It's incredible. With the socialists, [they] take your liberties and offer little candies. It's all free,"" he said before the video jumped to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., calling for ""free tuition.""

""Victims of Socialism"" represents a broader, apparent strategy by the RNC to tag Democrats with the more left-wing positions that gained steam during the Democratic primary. While the ad mostly targets Democratic candidates like Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., it also points to how a slew of 2020 candidates – including former Vice President Joe Biden, a perceived moderate – have committed to free health care for illegal immigrants.

The ad came as Biden looked less like the presumptive nominee and Warren gained ground in polling for key states. Warren maintains that she's capitalist, although she espouses many of the same policies as Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. — both self-described ""Democratic socialists."" Sanders, who often polls in the top three among Democrats, also enjoyed a raucous rally last week in which progressive icon, Ocasio-Cortez, threw her weight behind him.

The new campaign aims to reinforce the longstanding criticism that socialism is a dream with plans that are divorced from reality.

""The socialist person, the socialist people. They are very good poets and they are very good in oratory,"" Warner M., a former Venezuelan mayor, explained.

After shifting to a clip of Ocasio-Cortez giving an impassioned speech, a woman appeared to describe how she and others made a terrible mistake in ignoring warnings about socialism.

""Of course, we made a terrible mistake. You know? We didn't listen. Many people warned us and said ... 'you need to stop this' and 'you do not need to go for this.' And unfortunately, we made the error of saying, 'that's not going to happen in Venezuela,"" said Karla N., who also left Venezuela.

Warner M. added that socialism begets leaders who are focused on ""how to maintain power.""

The video is Gabbard's latest response to Clinton's unsubstantiated suggestion that Gabbard was a ""favorite of the Russians"" in a recent interview. Clinton also claimed without evidence that Russians were ""grooming her to be the third-party candidate"" in the 2020 presidential election.

""Hillary, your foreign policy was a disaster for our country and the world -- resulting in the deaths and injuries of so many of my brothers and sisters in uniform, devastating entire countries, millions of lives lost, refugee crises,"" and more, Gabbard said.

""Yet despite the damage you have done to our country and the world, you want to continue your failed policies directly or indirectly through the Democratic nominee.""

She added: ""It's time for you to acknowledge the damage you have caused and apologize for it. It is long past time for you to step down from your throne so the Democratic Party can lead with a new foreign policy which will actually be in the interests of and benefit the American people and the world.""

Gabbard, an Army veteran who served in the Iraq War, had Monday said she's open to having a ""face-to-face"" with Clinton. This, after fellow presidential hopefuls Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.; former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and spiritual author Marianne Williamson pushed back on Clinton's suggestion that she's a secret Russian asset.

""If you stand up to Hillary and the party power brokers -- if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message. But, here is the truth: They will not intimidate us. They will not silence us.""

In 2016, Gabbard quit as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to support Sanders, and she accused party leaders of limiting her free speech and tipping the scales to favor Clinton's campaign.

She was warned that her endorsement of Sanders ""would be the end of my 'political career' -- they said Clinton would never forget,"" Gabbard said Sunday.

“The short of it is that she’s on a book tour and is feeling unconstrained about speaking her mind,” Clinton spokesperson Nick Merrill told Fox News on Monday. “It’s easy to over-ascribe a strategy about every word she utters, but it’s as simple as that. She’s out there telling the truth.”

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., continued wielding her national clout on Tuesday as she threw her weight behind Jessica Cisneros, a progressive candidate challenging yet another Democratic incumbent that Ocasio-Cortez described as non-responsive to constituent interests.

""The people of South Texas deserve a Democrat like Jessica who is going to fight for real people, not big corporate donors like the Koch Brothers, GEO Group, and Exxon,"" Ocasio-Cortez reportedly said in a jab at Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas. Cuellar serves as the representative for the state's 28th congressional district and previously served as the state's Secretary of State.

Cuellar, who has spent more than a decade in Congress, has received criticism over support for anti-abortion legislation. He also received an ""A"" rating from the National Rifle Association and took donations KochPAC, a group representing the interests of Koch Industries.

“When [Cisneros] is elected, not only will I no longer be the youngest person in Congress — I’ll have a strong new ally in the fight for Medicare for All, getting corporate money out of politics, and fixing our broken immigration system,"" Ocasio-Cortez said, according to the group Justice Democrats.

AOC BACKS SANDERS AT NEW YORK RALLY, CREDITS HIM WITH 'FUNDAMENTALLY' CHANGING POLITICS

Cisneros, 26, previously served as Cuellar's intern. In a pinned tweet, she blasts her former boss as ""Trump's favorite Democrat.""

""I’m the proud daughter of Mexican immigrants and a human rights lawyer. I’m running to take on Trump’s favorite Democrat, @RepCuellar,"" she said. ""It's time for South Texas to have a real Democrat who will fight for la gente, not corporate donors.""

A campaign video shows Cisneros touting her immigrant heritage and questioning whether Cuellar is an authentic Democrat.

""Our congressman claims to be a Democrat but he's voted with Trump nearly 70 percent of the time,"" she says in the video. She also highlighted his votes to cut funding for sanctuary cities and abortion. ""Henry Cuellar fights to protect Trump and the big corporations,"" she says before endorsing a slew of progressive policies like the ""Green New Deal.""

BIDEN DISMISSIVE OF OCASIO-CORTEZ'S EXPECTED ENDORSEMENT OF BERNIE SANDERS

Cuellar's office did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Cuellar previously attacked Ocasio-Cortez and other members of the progressive ""squad"" after they targeted him for a primary. ""They're socialists and they want to impose their vision to Texas and we certainly know that in Texas our vision is very different from ... what I call these Justice Democrats, which are really socialists. They're not really Democrats,"" he said in July.

Ocasio-Cortez, along with Justice Democrats' help, famously won her district's primary, unseating a long-term and powerful incumbent in the House of Representatives.

Since entering Congress, the freshman lawmaker has gained traction in progressive politics, fielding endorsement requests from major presidential candidates and seeing her ""Green New Deal"" mentioned in 2020 candidates' climate plans.

DESIGN STUDIO RELEASING OCASIO-CORTEZ ACTION FIGURE

Ocasio-Cortez has been especially critical of moderate Democrats like former Vice President Joe Biden and previous candidates who opposed ""Medicare for all."" Last week, she publicly endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who has long represented a progressive insurgency pushing Democrats towards a version of socialism.

At the state and local level, she endorsed progressive challengers in Queens, New York, Illinois, and Massachusetts. It's unclear how much sway her endorsements will have in the last two as the first didn't give Tiffany Caban the boost she needed to win the rece for District Attorney.

If previous endorsements are any judge, though, Ocasio-Cortez's latest decision will likely create even more division in the Democratic Party. Rep. Dan Lipinski, D-Ill., blasted Ocasio-Cortez as a harbinger of extremism when she endorsed his primary challenger for the 2020 election. The congresswoman responded by calling his statement ""aggressive.""

""Aggressive statements like these are so casually thrown from corporate candidates towards grassroots ones, yet they never get branded as 'divisive,' despite their rhetoric,"" she said."

""Tulsi Gabbard, much like President Trump, does not take guff from anyone and, unlike many of her Democratic cohorts and competitors, she refuses to kiss the Clinton ring,"" continued Lahren on her show ""Final Thoughts.""

Clinton kicked off a fight with Gabbard by suggesting that the Army National Guard major, who served two tours in the Middle East, is secretly in league with the Russian government.

TRUMP DEFENDS GABBARD, SUGGESTS CLINTON IS 'SICK'

Appearing on the podcast of a former aide to President Barack Obama, Clinton said, in remarks widely interpreted to be in reference to Gabbard, ""I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She's the favorite of the Russians.""

""This, coming from Ms. Crooked, email-deleting, Benghazi lying, pay-for-play Clinton Foundation, failed Russia restart, Hillary Clinton?"" remarked Lahren. ""For her to accuse anybody of being crooked, corrupt, or anything of the sort is so unbelievably tone-deaf and painfully ironic.""

""It’s no question Hillary has it out for Tulsi. The question is why,"" she continued.

""First, Hillary is the leader of the war hawk war party,"" offered Lahren. ""She, along with many neocon Republicans, has been a cheerleader for endless conflict, foreign intervention and the very regime change wars that Tulsi Gabbard rallies against.""

""Secondly,"" said Lahren, ""Hillary may still have bad blood with her over the 2016 Bernie Sanders endorsement. Hillary holding a grudge? Shocking, I know.""

However, Lahren said that she believes the most significant factor driving Clinton to attempt to undermine Gabbard is that ""Tulsi will not fall in line.""

TRUMP REIGNITES FEUD WITH HILLARY CLINTON

""Tulsi is the only Democratic contender willing to directly call out Hillary and the Clinton dynasty. The Clinton regime does not tolerate dissent. They do not tolerate Democrats who don’t fall in line.""

In response to Clinton's accusation, Gabbard tweeted at the former first lady, calling her ""the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long...""

""Even Elizabeth Warren falls in line,"" alleged Lahren.

Indeed, Newsweek reported, ""Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden, both tier-one candidates, have remained largely silent on the issue."" Additionally, the Biden campaign outright declined to comment on Clinton's remarks on Monday.

In the most pointed response yet, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders I-Vt., tweeted, ""People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset."" Notably, Sanders did not mention Clinton by name.

""I don’t know if she’s truly cozy with the Russians or not, but I for damn sure believe it’s her refusal to be cozy with the Clintons that has incurred the wrath of Hillary,"" said Lahren.

""The good news for Tulsi is, outside of the establishment elites, the D.C. beltway brats and the swamp — no one cares what Hillary has to say,"" she concluded.

Co-host Brian Kilmeade asked if the possible candidacy of Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton or Michael Bloomberg worried the Trump campaign, and McEnany said none of them pose a threat. She also said the former secretary of state and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee should certainly get in the race and try again.

""We encourage Hillary to get back in the race,"" she said. ""We would love it, so please do.""

HILLARY CLINTON MUSES ABOUT 2020 'REMATCHH' AGAINST TRUMP: 'I CAN BEAT HIM AGAIN'

""There's no way the Democratic Party would support that,"" co-host Ainsley Earhardt said.

Clinton in recent weeks has privately stated she would enter the race if she were certain she could win, The New York Times reported Tuesday.

Clinton has also been publicly hinting at a possible White House run in 2020 and made reference to a possible rematch last week while appearing on ""PBS News Hour."" She claimed she could beat Trump ""again.""

""So maybe there does need to be a rematch,"" Clinton added. ""Obviously, I can beat him again. But, just seriously, I don't understand, I don't think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.""

She replied to Trump's taunts on Twitter about her running again earlier this month and warned him not to ""tempt"" her.

Conservative commentator and Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro also raised the issue last week and said if Clinton had any desire to get in the race, now is the time.

""Honestly, if Hillary Clinton were to make her grand reentrance, now would be about the time she should do it,"" he said. ""Because the fact is, a lot of people are dissatisfied with [Joe] Biden. A lot of people are dissatisfied with [Elizabeth] Warren and Hillary is an enormous name.""

McEnany said the reports of Clinton considering another run show the weakness of the current field, which includes and ""Sleepy Joe"" Biden and ""radical socialism"" from Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. She predicted that Warren will be the nominee and the race will be ""the case for socialism versus President Trump"" and his strong economic policies."

Robert Torricelli told “America’s Newsroom” Wednesday that nominating former Vice President Joe Biden as the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee would be problematic due to the lingering questions about his son's financial dealings with Ukraine and China.

“The problem Democrats are facing in this race is that if Joe Biden is the nominee, Hunter Biden becomes 'Hillary Clinton’s emails,'” Torricelli said, predicting that the side issue will dog his campaign as it did for the former secretary of state in 2016.

Torricelli’s comments came after a new CNN national poll showed Biden leading the field following a recent dip. According to the poll conducted by the market research firm SSRS, Biden has the support of 34 percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters, his widest margin since his campaign officially launched on April 25.

REP. JORDAN ON HUNTER BIDEN'S UKRAINE DEALINGS: 'THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNEW RIGHT FROM THE GET-GO THIS WAS WRONG'

Sen. Elizabeth Warren has 19 percent, with Sen. Bernie Sanders at 16 percent.

Host Bill Hemmer asked Torricelli if a similar case could be made about Warren's, D-Mass., far-left policy proposals. Torricelli argued that ""Hunter Biden’s consulting contracts in China"" are more problematic than Republicans accusing Warren of being a socialist.

REP. STEVE SCALISE ON CLINTON'S EMAILS: 'OUGHT TO BE INVESTIGATED' TO FIND OUT HOW RUSSIANS TRIED TO INTERFERE IN 2016 ELECTION

Torricelli said he still views Warren as the front-runner and believes national poll numbers ""will correct themselves.""

""There is a Democratic core sympathy for Biden for what he has gone through that has boosted his numbers. This is still, in my opinion, an Elizabeth Warren race. She's the only one with the organization, she's got the money, she's got the message, she is focused,"" he said.

Last week, Hunter Biden broke his silence since his relationship with companies in Ukraine and China came under scrutiny.

In a nationally televised interview, Biden maintained he did nothing improper while he served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Biden, 49, told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that accepting the lucrative position was, in retrospect, ""poor judgment.""

Biden said he did not discuss the Burisma Holdings board seat with his father, except for one ""brief exchange"" that was previously reported.

Hunter Biden announced previously he will be stepping down from the board of a Chinese equity fund and that he would not work for any foreign-owned companies if his father becomes president.

Bill Weld, a 2020 Republican presidential candidate, called President Trump ""completely unacceptable"" and rejected his claim GOP lawmakers who don't support him are ""human scum.""

Weld, who was 2016 Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson's running mate, told Neil Cavuto Wednesday on ""Your World"" he is also seeing electoral headway in New Hampshire ahead of that state's 2020 primary.

""I think the president is too out of control for this country,"" he said.

""Things are moving in New Hampshire. I came up 28 points against the president in a head-to-head in the last 30 days... The president doesn't help himself when he goes three-for-three on making America look like an unreliable ally.""

BILL WELD 'THRILLED' OTHER REPUBLICANS ARE CHALLENGING TRUMP IN PRIMARY

In that regard, Weld claimed Trump has weakened America's standing in the world through his treatment of the Kurds in the Middle East, Ukraine, and most recently Iran.

Weld claimed the president is ""begging"" to get back to the negotiating table with Tehran.

He later laughed heartily when Cavuto asked about the president's recent tweets -- one of which claimed Republicans who don't support him are ""human scum,"" and another that labeled frequent critic Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, a ""pompous ass.""

""I think that he just is so unreliable and just can't stick to a story, and particularly not a true story,"" he said.

Regarding his primary battle with Trump, Weld said he is honing in on both New Hampshire and Super Tuesday states.

He rejected the claim his candidacy could be seen as hurting the Republican Party.

""They say everyone's got to be loyal and rally around the flag [but] too often, particularly in Washington, D.C., loyalty is nothing but an excuse for doing the wrong thing,"" he said.

He called progressive Democratic presidential hopefuls Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., ""not currently electable in the United States,"" but added Trump's reelection would be ""perhaps a bigger risk than those two Democrats -- who would not be able to get anything through Congress.""

During the interview, Weld and Cavuto also discussed whether his focus on New Hampshire has parallels to then-Sen. Eugene McCarthy's, D-Minn., surprise primary performance there in 1968 -- which lead incumbent President Lyndon Johnson to later drop out of the race. The 1968 Democratic nomination eventually went to Johnson's vice president, Hubert H. Humphrey.

""I'm looking for 50 percent, not 40 percent. Pat Buchanan got 37, Gene McCarthy got 41 and they knocked people out of the race, but I have in mind Super Tuesday,"" Weld said."

He then gets on top of a yellow Ford Thunderbird and laying on his side, posing on the car.

""I feel like a kid in a candy store without the owners because you can do anything,"" Cardenas says. He then moves on to another car, a pink Thunderbird, and opens the driver's side door — which dings into another vehicle sitting next to it.

But the former vice president’s lead is taking a hit as top-tier rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s support soars in the contest the Biden campaign sees as a firewall.

Biden – who has longstanding ties in the state – stands at 33 percent among South Carolina voters likely to cast a ballot in the state’s February primary, according to a new poll from Monmouth University. That’s down 6 percentage points from Monmouth’s previous survey in the Palmetto State, which was conducted in July.

THE LATEST 2020 POLLING FROM FOX NEWS

Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, stands at 16 percent in the survey, a jump of 7 points from July.

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is in third in the new poll, at 12 percent. The populist independent senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House bid stood at 10 percent in the previous survey.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who stood at 12 percent in the July survey, saw her support drop in half and now comes in at 6 percent in the new poll.

Environmental and progressive advocate and former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer has the backing of 4 percent of likely South Carolina Democratic primary voters, with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 3 percent, and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang each at 2 percent. The remaining nine candidates in the record-setting Democratic presidential field all register at 1 percent or less.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Besides the topline findings, the poll also has warning signs for Biden among South Carolina’s black voters, who make up more than half of the likely Democratic primary electorate. The former vice president’s position as either a first- or second-choice candidate dropped by 10 points among black voters to 52 percent, while Warren’s position as a top-two choice contender jumped 11 points to 26 percent.

“Biden is still in a pretty good position in South Carolina, but there are some signs that he might not have a true firewall among black voters. If he does not do well in the earlier contests in February, there may be potential for current preferences to shift here,” Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray said in a statement.

The Monmouth University Poll was conducted Oct. 16-21, with 402 South Carolina voters likely to cast a ballot in the Democratic presidential primary questioned by live telephone operators. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points."

The story -- titled “Anxious Democratic Establishment Asks, ‘Is There Anybody Else?’” -- said about a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered in New York City questioned whether former front-runner Joe Biden could stand strong against President Trump, citing Biden’s lackluster debate performance in Ohio last week.

They also raised concerns about the former vice president's fundraising struggles and his need to defend his family’s business dealings in Ukraine amid the ongoing Trump impeachment inquiry.

They also said Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont were likely too liberal to win the general election.

Meanwhile, The Washington Post, citing unnamed sources, reported that Clinton was considering a 2020 rematch against Trump after the State Department concluded this week there was ""no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information"" regarding Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state.

Host Ainsley Earhardt said people like retired Navy Adm. William McRaven and Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, are being urged to run due to the ""weakness"" in the field. Other Democrats have urged former first lady Michelle Obama to run, though she said over the summer there is ""zero chance"" she will do so.

Kilmeade said traditional Democrats are concerned that proposing free health care for illegal immigrants, potentially taking away private insurance in favor of a ""Medicare-for-all system"" and imposing a Green New Deal on the energy industry will not appeal to voters in the middle.

""They're saying, 'You want to give a Green New Deal that would destroy the energy industry? You want to give free health care to illegal immigrants? What planet are you on that you want to take down ObamaCare?' ... That's what everyone is saying on these stages,"" he said.

""You see it on the Democratic side with Hillary Clinton — and now she's going after Tulsi Gabbard calling her a 'Russian asset,'"" he said.

Appearing on former President Obama aide David Plouffe's ""Campaign HQ"" podcast last week, Clinton accused Gabbard – although not referring to her by name – of being a ""Russian asset"" and a ""third-party candidate.""

“I'm not making any predictions but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,” Clinton said. “She's the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.”

Gabbard lashed out at Clinton on Twitter Friday, calling her the ""queen of warmongers [and the] embodiment of corruption"" in response to the allegations.

She also told Fox News' Tucker Carlson on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" last week that Clinton is waging a smear campaign against her because ""she knows she can't control me."" She accused Clinton of having ""blood on her hands"" after the Iraq War she ""championed.""

""Their blood is on her hands. That's why she's smearing my character and trying to undermine my campaign,"" Gabbard said.

Hillary Clinton is firmly inserting herself into the campaign – arguing without evidence that Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii is a “Russian asset,” and mocking President Trump’s direct interactions with foreign leaders.

GABBARD SAYS SHE'S OPEN TO FACE-TO-FACE MEETING WITH CLINTON

The former first lady, senator from New York and secretary of state, and the first major-party female presidential nominee, has remained in the spotlight after winning the 2016 national popular vote but losing the election and the White House to Trump. And she’s served as a longtime foil for Republicans.

But her comments and actions in recent days have elevated her relevance in the 2020 campaign to a new level – renewing questions about her role in the race for the White House and sparking some speculation that she still has ambitions to mount a third bid for president.

Her top aides downplay such speculation.

“The short of it is that she’s on a book tour and is feeling unconstrained about speaking her mind,” longtime Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told Fox News. “It’s easy to over-ascribe a strategy about every word she utters, but it’s as simple as that. She’s out there telling the truth.”

Clinton’s criticism of Gabbard and the candidate’s fierce pushback quickly dominated the 2020 campaign headlines. Many of the other Democratic White House hopefuls were asked to weigh in on the conflict.

Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, a top supporter and surrogate for Clinton during the 2016 election, told reporters after a stop in New Hampshire on Monday that “I am disappointed that this has been in the news as long as it’s been. We need to focus on winning this election and that for me, talking about the issues, talking about the urgencies that we have before us and not indulging in what I think is, for me, not a relevant story.”

Booker told reporters throughout the day that “I will not indulge” in weighing in on the controversy or directly reacting to the comments by Clinton or Gabbard.

Gabbard, in a blistering video released over the weekend, suggested that Clinton had “smeared” her as payback for the Hawaii congresswoman’s endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders in the marathon 2016 Democratic presidential primary battle. Gabbard quit her role as a vice chair in the Democratic National Committee to back Sanders – a one-time longshot who waged an outsider fight for the nomination that didn’t end until he endorsed the eventual nominee well after the end of the primaries.

""If you stand up to Hillary and the party power brokers -- if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message,” Gabbard said. “But, here is the truth: They will not intimidate us. They will not silence us.""

Sanders, who’s running a second straight time for the nomination, took to Twitter on Monday to defend Gabbard, an officer in the Hawaii national guard who served in the war in Iraq.

“Tulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country. People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset,” Sanders wrote.

Fellow Democratic presidential contenders former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, and best selling spiritual author Marianne Williamson also defended Gabbard.

In addition to suggesting Gabbard was a ""Russian asset"" during a podcast last week, Clinton asserted, also without evidence, that Moscow was ""grooming her to be the third-party candidate"" to serve as a spoiler in helping Trump’s re-election.

While Clinton’s claims are unsubstantiated, Gabbard – who preaches anti-interventionism as she runs for the White House – has been promoted by Russian state-owned media and some alt-right websites.

Gabbard reiterated on Monday to reporters that she’s committed to not running as a third-party candidate and said she would vote for the eventual Democratic standard-bearer.

CLINTON ADMONISHES TRUMP AFTER HE URGES HER TO RUN AGAIN, SAYING 'DON'T TEMPT ME'

The latest episodes – plus Clinton’s back and forth with Trump on Twitter a week ago when the president tempted her to run again and she responded by saying “don’t tempt me” – all spark a conversation of just what her role should be in the 2020 campaign.

There’s no script for just what a former presidential nominee should do and say in ensuing elections. She’s held conversations with some of the candidates, giving her advice. And she’s helped the party raise money, headlining fundraisers for the Democratic National Committee.

For Booker, Clinton’s role is clear.

“She’s an extraordinary statesperson in our party. This is one of the most successful secretary of states easily in my lifetime,” he highlighted. “She needs to play a leadership role in our party going forward and I am looking forward to her doing so.”

But Larry Cohen, one of Sanders' top supporters, warned that Clinton could harm the eventual 2020 nominee by weighing in against specific candidates, even a longshot like Gabbard.

Clinton has ""put a lifetime into the Democratic Party. She deserves to be heard,"" said Cohen, a prominent member of the Democratic National Committee who also chairs Our Revolution, the spinoff of Sanders' last presidential campaign. But ""in this senior leader role she has,"" Cohen said, ""it's her job to embrace the range of politics within the party and not polarize within it.""

Gabbard, in a blistering video released over the weekend, suggested that Clinton had “smeared” her as payback for the Hawaii congresswoman’s endorsement of Sanders in the marathon 2016 Democratic presidential primary battle.

The former first lady, senator from New York and secretary of state, and the first major-party female presidential nominee has remained in the spotlight after winning the 2016 national popular vote but losing the election and the White House to Trump. And she’s served as a longtime foil for Republicans.

But her comments and actions in recent days have elevated her relevance in the 2020 campaign to a new level – renewing questions about her role in the race for the White House and sparking some speculation that she still has ambitions to mount a third bid for president.

Yang said that “nominees of the party from past cycles remain very important figures in the party, in that Hillary would have a lot of value to add.”

But he then emphasized that “she's not a candidate and it strikes me as a little bit inappropriate for her to be commenting directly about candidates since we're all Democrats. And you think that she’d be neutral unless she decided to endorse a particular candidate.”

WARREN SAYS SHE'LL SOON RELEASE PLAN ON HOW TO PAY FOR HER MEDICARE FOR ALL PROPOSAL

On health care, Yang announced that “we’re going to release a detailed health care plan in the days ahead.”

And specifically on the ""Medicare-for-all"" proposal introduced in the Senate by Sanders and backed by Warren, Yang said: “I support the spirit of what Bernie is trying to accomplish. I do think that outlawing private insurance in a very short period of time is a bit too disruptive, and I would not do it.”

He reiterated that “I've been on the record for a long time saying that there would be a role for some private insurers in my plan. I think most private insurers will disappear if we do a good enough job with the public plan, but that there would be some companies that genuinely do add value and adapt to the new circumstances.”

As Yang arrived in New Hampshire, his staff in the state was in the process of expanding. Yang’s team in the crucial early-voting state stood at around 15 at the beginning of the month, but a senior adviser told Fox News they planned to add at least 10 new hires by the end of October or early November.

Yang’s campaign has been fueled by his unconventional style and his push for what he calls the ‘Freedom Dividend,’ a universal basic income system that would pay all adult Americans $1,000 per month. The plan would help Americans cope with the loss of jobs due to the increased impact of automation and artificial intelligence.

Asked if he’d be open to serving as the Democratic Party’s running mate if he fails to win the nomination, Yang told Fox News “my goal is to solve the problems of the 21st century. I believe the best way I can do that is as president. But if it's in some other capacity, I'd be open to that. The goal is really just to make sure that this country is in a condition that I'm proud to pass along to my kids.”

Yang, along with many other of the Democratic presidential candidates, has disavowed outside super PACs as he pledges to combat the influence of dark money in politics. But a new group – called the Math PAC – has vowed to raise and spend at least $1 million in support of Yang’s campaign.

Yang told Fox News and CBS News that “I know very little about the Math PAC, genuinely.”

“I'm not going to try and dissuade them, because we have the rules that we have. After I'm president, I'm very happy to repeal Citizens United and try and do away with super PACs entirely. But given the rules that we have right now, my goal is to compete and to win and so I'm not going to dissuade private citizens from trying to help,” he added.

Yang’s come a long way since the early days of his campaign, when the outsider and first-time candidate was the longest of long shots. He said he now feels like he’s being taken seriously by the Democratic establishment

“I've been thrilled by the momentum that the campaign has gotten; certainly we might have started as something of a newcomer/outsider, but I feel like I'm becoming more and more part of the establishment, as we get more support,” he noted.

But there continue to be moments when the candidate – who’s qualified for all of the presidential primary debates to date – is snubbed by the mainstream media.

His supporters, known as the Yang Gang, have started a trending hashtag on Twitter dubbing what they are calling unfair coverage of the candidate a #YangMediaBlackout. The latest example they cite is The Weather Channel, which did not invite Yang to participate in their climate change special set to air Nov. 7.

“Another mystery, given that by any objective standard, I am either fourth, fifth or sixth in this race. And so why would you invite, I believe, nine candidates or ten candidates and not invite Andrew Yang? I do not know. I have a very extensive climate change plan. I like the Weather Channel just as much as the next American,” Yang told Fox News when asked about the lack of an invite."

HILLARY CLINTON BACKS OUT OF DC EVENT ALSO SET TO INCLUDE TULSI GABBARD, KIRSTJEN NIELSEN: REPORT

Clinton in recent weeks has privately stated she would enter the 2020 presidential race if she were certain she could win, The New York Times reported Tuesday. The story, titled “Anxious Democratic Establishment Asks, ‘Is There Anybody Else?’,” said about a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered in New York City questioned whether former front-runner Joe Biden could stand strong against Trump, citing Biden’s lackluster debate performance in Ohio last week.

They also raised concerns about Biden's fundraising struggles and his need to defend his family’s business dealings in Ukraine amid the ongoing Trump impeachment inquiry.

They also said Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders were likely too liberal to win the general election.

Meanwhile, The Washington Post, citing unnamed sources, reported that Clinton was considering a 2020 rematch against Trump after the State Department concluded this week there was ""no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information"" regarding Clinton's use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state.

The same State Department report, however, found dozens of individuals were at fault for mishandling classified information and found hundreds of security violations during her 2009-2013 tenure.

Clinton, the first woman to win a major party presidential nomination – and the national popular vote leader with almost 3 million more votes than Trump – remains a popular figure in her party, even after enduring criticism for losing key Midwestern states in 2016. For Republicans, she's a perennial target — currently in the Mississippi governor's race, where Democratic nominee Jim Hood, a longtime attorney general, is being attacked for acknowledging he voted for her over Trump.

Clinton’s supporters within the Democratic establishment have also passed around an op-ed published earlier this month in the San Francisco Chronicle by former Mayor Willie Brown titled: “Who should run against Trump? How about Hillary Clinton?” The Washington Post reported.

Both the Post and the Times reported that Clinton was not the only possible last-minute candidate on Democrats’ minds. Also being considered were: former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Disney chief executive Bob Iger, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and former first lady Michelle Obama.

Speaking at the Fortune Most Powerful Women dinner at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington on Tuesday night, Gabbard said a lack of clarity could “undermine the integrity” of the investigation.

“Pursuing impeachment for partisan reasons is bad for our country,” she said. “It will be extremely divisive for an already divided country. I looked at the complaint and was very concerned. We need to get to the bottom of it.""

CLINTON-GABBARD CLASH RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT 2016 DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE'S ROLE IN 2020

GABBARD SAYS SHE'S OPEN TO FACE-TO-FACE MEETING WITH CLINTON

“There needs to be a transparent and narrowly focused inquiry -- I am disappointed with the lack of transparency,"" she said. ""They have been behind closed doors.""

“That has the potential to undermine the integrity of a nonpartisan investigation,” the congresswoman explained.

Gabbard’s appearance came just after she fired the latest shot in her ongoing feud with Hillary Clinton.

In a new campaign video released Tuesday, Gabbard assailed Clinton, calling for her to ""acknowledge the damage you've caused"" and ""step down from your throne.""

The video is Gabbard's latest response to Clinton's suggestion that Gabbard was a Russian asset and ""favorite of the Russians"" in a recent interview.

Clinton also claimed that Russia was ""grooming her to be the third-party candidate"" in reference to Gabbard's 2020 candidacy.

""Hillary, your foreign policy was a disaster for our country and the world -- resulting in the deaths and injuries of so many of my brothers and sisters in uniform, devastating entire countries, millions of lives lost, refugee crises,"" and more, Gabbard said.

""Yet despite the damage you have done to our country and the world, you want to continue your failed policies directly or indirectly through the Democratic nominee.""

She added: ""It's time for you to acknowledge the damage you have caused and apologize for it. It is long past time for you to step down from your throne so the Democratic Party can lead with a new foreign policy which will actually be in the interests of and benefit the American people and the world.""

Gabbard, an Army veteran who served in the Iraq War, had Monday said she's open to having a ""face-to-face"" with Clinton. This, after fellow presidential hopefuls Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.; former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and spiritual author Marianne Williamson pushed back on Clinton's unfounded suggestion that she's a secret Russian asset.

Tulsi Gabbard and Hillary Clinton.

The feud is also good news for Gabbard, D-Hawaii, whose presidential candidacy is on life-support. She is supported by only 1.3 percent of Democrats in the latest RealClear Politics average of presidential primary polls.

But thanks to her feud with Clinton, Gabbard is attracting heavy media coverage – something she desperately needs to give her dark horse presidential candidacy any chance of success.

TULSI GABBARD TO HILLARY CLINTON: 'STEP DOWN FROM YOUR THRONE'

Gabbard added fuel to the feud Tuesday when she released a new campaign video attacking Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee. And Gabbard tweeted: “@HillaryClinton your foreign policy was a disaster for our country and the world. It’s time for you to acknowledge the damage you have caused and step down from your throne.”

The Clinton-Gabbard battle burst into the headlines last week, when Clinton said in an interview that the Russians have “got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate.”

“She's the favorite of the Russians,” Clinton added. “They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.”

While Clinton didn’t name Gabbard, it was clear that the former first lady, senator and secretary of state was referring to the Hawaii congresswoman.

Clinton also said that 2016 Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein was a “Russian asset” – a charge Stein denied and called “a ludicrous, unhinged conspiracy theory with no basis in fact.”

Gabbard posted a video Sunday denouncing Clinton and saying she would not be silenced by Clinton and ""her gang of rich, powerful elite.""

Trump couldn’t resist getting into the middle of the feud Monday, telling reporters that Clinton is “accusing everyone of being a Russian agent.” The president added that Gabbard is “not a Russian agent.”

And other Democratic presidential candidates – including Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and author Marianne Williamson – said they don’t believe Gabbard is a Russian asset.

Enough with this Democrat-on-Democrat fighting!

The Democratic presidential candidates need to be clear that their opponent is Donald Trump – not each other.

This latest infighting is a distraction and is turning off voters. If Democrats spend a lot of time and energy attacking each other in a civil war, Trump will have a much better shot at reelection, enabling him to cause even greater harm to our nation than he has caused already.

In 2016, the bitter race for the Democratic presidential nomination – which ended with Clinton defeating Sanders – led some Democratic voters to stay home or vote for Trump. This may have given Trump the margin he needed to win the presidential race in the Electoral College, even though Clinton had about 3 million more popular votes.

My fellow Democrats have to ask themselves: Are we going to support each other despite our personal or political differences so that we can send Trump into political retirement? Or is the temptation to tear each other down and highlight our differences more important? If we choose the latter, we’ll most likely lose – just like we did in 2016.

Is there any merit to Hillary Clinton’s accusations against Gabbard and SteinIf Democrats spend a lot of time and energy attacking each other in a civil war, Trump will have a much better shot at reelection, enabling him to cause even greater harm to our nation than he has caused already.

If Democrats spend a lot of time and energy attacking each other in a civil war, Trump will have a much better shot at reelection, enabling him to cause even greater harm to our nation than he has caused already.

Stein received about 1.5 million votes in 2016, but reports have come out of Congress showing that Russian election meddling directly contributed to that total. And of course, many of us remember the famous photo of Stein sitting at the same table as Russian President Vladimir Putin back in 2015.

As for Gabbard, it’s no surprise that she’s not a huge Clinton fan nor vice versa. In 2016, the congresswoman resigned as the vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee in order to endorse Sanders in his nomination fight against Clinton.

There are plenty of reasons Gabbard is barely registering in the polls.

For example, in 2016 Gabbard advocated that the U.S. work with Syria’s brutal dictator Bashar Assad, who has used chemical warfare against his own civilian population in the Syrian civil war. An estimated 400,000 people have been killed in the civil war, which began in 2011, and about 5.7 million Syrians have fled their country to escape the fighting, according to the U.N.

In 2017 Gabbard even traveled to Syria and met with Assad.

Additionally, according to news reports, Twitter bots that seem to originate in Russia have been quite active on Gabbard’s behalf. And Russian state media have been giving her a disproportionate amount of coverage, considering she is barely registering in the polls.

But all this aside, should the Democrats be talking about this? Should Hillary Clinton have said anything about Gabbard? And should Gabbard have responded?

No, no and no.

For the sake of the American people – who need to replace Trump because his failed leadership, divisiveness and erratic behavior are causing more and more serious problems for our country and the world – I hope Clinton and Gabbard stop attacking each other. They need to use all their energy to concentrate on making the case for replacing Trump.

Trump flaunted his actions to bolster the oil and gas industries in the country – including approving some controversial pipelines, pulling out of Paris Climate Accord and abandoning former President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan – while slamming Democrats for putting the fossil fuel industry ""under assault,"" as he put it.

""Our natural resources don’t belong to the government, they belong to the people,"" Trump said during the speech at the Shale Insight Conference. ""We've ended the war on American energy and we’ve ended the assault on American energy workers.""

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MOVES TOWARD NATIONAL FUEL ECONOMY STANDARD, PREPARES FOR LEGAL BATTLE WITH CALIFORNIA

The president’s speech, in front of an audience comprised heavily of blue-collar workers from Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, marked the second time in three months he has traveled to the Keystone State. Pennsylvania, which Trump narrowly won in 2016, would be a crucial state to win in the next presidential election; Trump apparently has seen his pro-industry policies as a path toward winning it, and his reelection, once again.

The president railed against a ban on fracking – which had the support of many Democrats seeking to unseat him in 2020 – arguing that the controversial method of extracting natural gas brought wealth to rural and downtrodden areas and will create a boom in construction jobs throughout the state.

""My job is to represent to people of Pittsburgh, not the people of Paris,"" Trump said, resurfacing a line he used previously.

The politics surrounding the oil and gas industry in Pennsylvania, however, has not been as clean as Trump said the pipelines will be.

In the suburbs that might be key to his path to victory, Pennsylvania voters have shown a growing opposition to the drilling and massive pipelines required to move its product across the state. Candidates in state and local races increasingly have been hardening their stances on the industry. National polling showed growing skepticism of fracking, the process used in extraction.

While the issue is unlikely to have a game-changing effect on the race already dominated by Trump's strong personality, a looming impeachment fight and accusations of racism, Trump's eagerness to promote the industry underscored his tight focus on shoring up his base of rural voters, even at the risk of alienating others.

""Today, I'm proud to declare that I've delivered on every single promise I made to this conference three years ago and much, much more,"" Trump said.

Several Democrats seeking the White House have taken their own political risks on the issue. Backed by environmentalists on the left, soe candidates— including Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren — have broken from the party's past support for fracking to call for a nationwide ban. More centrist candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden, have declined to go that far.

Biden, who also was in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, openly criticized Trump, saying the policies he espoused hurt those very same blue-collar workers the president was courting later in the day.

Biden cast the wealthy president as a charlatan populist whose tax policies, economic stewardship and overall erratic leadership style has hurt U.S. workers.

""This administration has no idea what hard-working, decent, ordinary Americans are going through,"" Biden said during a speech in his hometown of Scranton.

Biden has argued that he could reassemble Obama's winning coalition by winning back some working-class white voters who sided with Trump while reversing Democrats' decline from 2012 among nonwhite voters in cities such as Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee.

""After the hardcover edition came out last winter, I traveled around the country... to promote it and talk to admirers of my father, people who read him and watched him on TV,"" he said.

""It was really moving and touching for me to realize how much of an impact he had on so many people.""

DANIEL KRAUTHAMMER: IN SEARCH OF CIVILITY -- IN OUR POLITICS NOW, WE ARE INCREASINGLY TALKING PAST EACH OTHER

Krauthammer said people have told him they feel ""lost"" without his father, who died in 2018 at the age of 68 after a battle with cancer.

He said his father would always go to the core of a political issue and opine without regard to a particular party or ideology, but through a few basic principles.

His father, he said, strived to be truthful, without ""pulling punches,"" or ""shaping his opinions just to please someone or please public opinion.""

To that extent, Baier noted then-candidate Donald Trump had an up-and-down relationship with the elder Krauthammer.

In June 2017, Trump called the late columnist ""highly overrated pundit.""

""I saw that -- I couldn't believe it. Thank you Charles, I'm going to make you look good, Charles,"" Trump said.

In response, Daniel Krauthammer told Baier those two exchanges validated the way his father viewed politics and politicians.

""My father really -- as he said many times -- his job was to call a folly a folly, and it didn't matter which side that was on,"" he said.

""He separated out what was real policy difference that's valid and should be met that way, and things that really were beyond the pale and really should be criticized.""

Krauthammer remarked Trump's responses in those interviews also showed people, ""never knew where my dad was going to land on a certain issue.""

He added his father would likely continue that practice in the present, shying away from attacking politicians' character and instead trying to have a debate on the issues.

SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT REACHES NEW HIGH

Quinnipiac University: “Approval among American voters of the U.S. House impeachment inquiry, an inquiry to determine whether or not to bring impeachment charges against President Trump, has reached its highest level, as 55 percent approve of the inquiry, while 43 percent disapprove, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. Last week, 51 percent of voters approved of the inquiry, while 45 percent disapproved. In today's poll, Democrats approve of the inquiry 93 - 7 percent and independent voters approve 58 - 37 percent, while Republicans disapprove of the inquiry 88 - 10 percent. … Nearly half of registered voters, 48 percent, say President Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 46 percent say he should not. Last week, 46 percent supported impeachment while 48 percent were opposed. In today's poll, support for impeachment is 86 - 9 percent among Democrats, and 49 - 41 percent among independents, while Republicans oppose impeachment 91 - 6 percent.”



Trump approval dropping - Quinnipiac University: “President Trump’s job approval rating has dipped below 40 percent for the first time since the impeachment inquiry began as 38 percent say they approve of the job he is doing, and 58 percent disapprove. Last week, 41 percent approved of the president’s job performance, while 54 percent disapproved. This is President Trump’s lowest net approval rating since a July 2018 poll. … Nancy Pelosi gets a mixed approval rating as 45 percent approve of the job she is doing as Speaker of the House, while 47 percent disapprove. Mitch McConnell’s approval rating is deep underwater as 57 percent of voters disapprove of the job he is doing as Senate Majority Leader, while only 24 percent approve.”



Top diplomat’s testimony rattles Congress - NYT: “[During] explosive testimony on Tuesday, William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, laid out in visceral terms the stakes of what he saw as an illegitimate scheme to pressure the Kiev government for political help by suspending American security aid. In by far the most damning account yet to become public in the House impeachment inquiry Mr. Taylor described a president holding up $391 million in assistance for the clear purpose of forcing Ukraine to help incriminate Mr. Trump’s domestic rivals. Mr. Trump’s actions, he testified, undercut American allies desperately fighting off Russia’s attempt to redraw the boundaries of Europe through force.”



Trump defenders storm deposition, shut down probe in protest - WaPo: “A group of House Republicans temporarily shut down the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry on Wednesday, barging into a secure room where a witness was set to testify and refusing to leave despite orders from top Democrats. A group of about two-dozen Trump allies stormed a room in the Capitol basement where three investigative committees were supposed to hear testimony from Laura Cooper, the Pentagon official who oversees Ukraine policy. Those members were not on the committees of jurisdiction and were not supposed to be present during the closed-door deposition. A shouting match began between Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.) and some Democrats in the room as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) left to consult with the sergeant at arms…”



Senate Republicans caution Trump on chaos - WashEx: “Senate Republicans are warning President Trump that he risks bungling impeachment politically and alienating voters, even as he survives a Senate trial, without a focused strategy prosecuted by competent political professionals. With House Democrats expected to approve articles of impeachment by Christmas, Senate Republicans are bracing for the trial, and they are imploring Trump to appreciate the gravity of the situation and prepare. Angry tweets and belligerent news conferences are not sufficient. The president is not in danger of losing anywhere near enough Republican support to be removed from office. But without an effective defense against the Democrats’ charges on the Senate floor, voters might conclude impeachment was justified and oust him in 2020.”



Biden called Clinton impeachment 'lynching' - Fox News: “Even as top Democrats rushed to condemn President Trump's comparison of their impeachment inquiry to a ‘lynching,’ footage and news reports have emerged showing several top Democrats referring matter-of-factly to Bill Clinton's impeachment proceedings as a ‘lynching’ in 1998. Among those Democrats are two African-American representatives still serving in the House, as well as House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and presidential contender Joe Biden. Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., called Clinton's impeachment a ‘persecution’ and a ‘political lynching’ on the House floor in 1998. And Danny Davis, D-Ill., condemned what he described as a ‘lynching in the People's House.’ Biden, who has condemned Trump's remarks as ‘abhorrent’ and ‘despicable,’ said in 1998 that a Clinton impeachment could be perceived as a ‘partisan lynching.’”



THE RULEBOOK: SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS

“The language of Virginia is still more pointed on this subject. Her constitution declares, ‘that the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments shall be separate and distinct; so that neither exercise the powers properly belonging to the other; nor shall any person exercise the powers of more than one of them at the same time, except that the justices of county courts shall be eligible to either House of Assembly.’” – James Madison, Federalist No. 47



TIME OUT: BETTER LATE THAN NEVER

Smithsonian: “Leonardo da Vinci wasn’t known for getting things done. He was often years or even decades late when delivering paintings, and many of the fantastical schemes he concocted… Still, new research conducted by engineers at MIT suggests one of the Renaissance giant’s unbuilt designs—a bridge poised to be the world’s longest—would have worked if the artist had actually followed through on his plans. Leonardo drafted his proposal in response to Sultan Bayezid II’s 1502 appeal for bridge designs. Bayezid, ruler of the Ottoman Empire, wanted to connect the cities of Constantinople and Galata, which were separated by a river estuary called the Golden Horn. … Bayezid was unimpressed by Leonardo’s complicated blueprints, and the bridge the artist envisioned was never built—at least until MIT engineer John Ochsendorf stepped in to test the 500-year-old design’s feasibility. …Ochsendorf and his colleagues analyzed materials available in 1502 and determined the Old Master would probably have used stone rather than wood or brick…”

BIDEN BOOMING

CNN: “Former Vice President Joe Biden's lead in the race for the Democratic nomination for president has rebounded, and now stands at its widest margin since April, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. Biden has the support of 34% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters, his best showing in CNN polling since just after his campaign's formal launch on April 25. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont are about even for second, with 19% and 16%, respectively. Behind them, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris of California each have 6% support, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke each at 3%. … Registered voters generally give Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg large advantages over President Donald Trump in hypothetical general election matchups’ Biden leads the President by 10 points…”



Still rolling in South Carolina - Monmouth University: “Former Vice President Joe Biden remains the clear front-runner among likely Democratic voters in South Carolina. The Monmouth University Poll finds little has changed in overall presidential primary support, but there is evidence that black voters’ preference for the front-runner varies significantly when age and education are taken into account. Biden currently holds 33% support among South Carolina voters who are likely to vote in the February 2020 Democratic primary. … Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (16%) and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (12%) are in the second tier of candidate preferences. … California Sen. Kamala Harris has 6% support… Tom Steyer (4%), South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (3%), New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (2%), Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (2%), and entrepreneur Andrew Yang (2%).”



Video shows Warren waffling on Medicare - Mediaite: “Massachusetts Senator and Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren backed off of Bernie Sanders’ ‘Medicare for All’ plan in leaked video of a private meeting with union officials, saying ‘it’s not that I have a plan that says we’re going to do this part and then we’re going to do this part,’ but that ‘we’re going to get to a table like this.’ Warren has vacillated between being ‘with Bernie’ on his health care plan and considering it a mere ‘framework,’ and most recently told CNN’s David Axelrod that Bernie’s plan is ‘my plan.’ But Mediaite has obtained leaked video from an August 23 meeting with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union executive board in which Warren is considerably more vague about the plan.”



Massachusans like Warren, but not so much her health plan - WBUR: “In the race for her party's presidential nomination, home state U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has opened up a wide lead among likely Democratic primary voters in Massachusetts, according to a new WBUR poll. … But the WBUR poll also has a note of caution for Warren. Medicare for All … is less popular among likely Democratic voters in this blue state than a plan that would include a public option… According to the survey, Warren leads a crowded Democratic field, with 33% of likely voters in the primary supporting her. Former Vice President Joe Biden is second with 18%, Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders is at 13%, and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is in fourth place with 7%. Fifteen percent refused to answer or said they didn't know their answer. While Warren probably benefits from home-field advantage, the poll is the latest in a series of recent surveys that show her moving to front-runner status.



HOW TEAM TRUMP MADE RALLIES DATA MINING MACHINES

WSJ: “The most transformational change has been turning rallies into large-scale data-mining operations. The Trump campaign has collected millions of phone numbers, email addresses and other personal information supporters hand over when signing up for text alerts or registering for rally tickets. The Trump team uses the data to reveal people’s political registrations and in which elections they have voted. Then the team cross-references that information with data on their consumer habits—already collected by the Republican Party—to forecast how likely each rallygoer is to vote in 2020 and which candidate the voter will probably support, campaign officials said. A yet-to-be released smartphone app will offer supporters certain perks, such as accelerated entry into rallies, in exchange for putting the campaign in contact with friends who might back the president and hand over personal data.”



Dem PAC spends big bashing Trump in key general election states - Axios: “A major outside Democratic group is outspending President Trump on Facebook ads in the crucial battleground states of Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Why it matters: 2020 presidential candidates have spent at least $61 million so far this cycle on Facebook and Google ads, with Trump in the lead, according to the Wesleyan Media Project. But that's national spending. The state-by-state spend (below) is important because that's where the 2020 election will be won. … Meanwhile, Priorities USA — a major Democratic super PAC — launched a digital ad campaign in late July ‘focused on holding President Trump accountable’ and highlighting how his economic policies have negatively affected some Americans. The group spent $40 million online in 2016 and they said they plan to spend more than that in 2020.”



Dick’s CEO tries on the idea of a presidential run - Politico: “Ed Stack, the CEO of Dick’s Sporting Goods and a longtime Republican donor, is testing the waters for a possible third-party presidential bid that could scramble the dynamics of the 2020 general election. Various messages were presented to a focus group in southern Wisconsin this week centering on the billionaire businessman, along with possible three-way match-ups against Donald Trump and Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren. The focus group, according to a source who took part in the testing, ran through varying themes involving Stack and heavily focused on his example of ‘showing leadership’ by halting the sale of assault-style rifles at all of Dick’s Sporting Goods stores in the wake of the high school massacre in Parkland, Florida.”



GOP HOLDS NARROW EDGE FOR MISSISSIPPI GOVERNOR

Mississippi Clarion Ledger: “A new poll shows the Mississippi gubernatorial race remains tight with less than two weeks to Election Day. It also found a majority of voters oppose impeaching and removing President Donald Trump from office. … Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves leading Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood 46% to 43%. 2% support third-party candidates Bob Hickingbottom or Dave Singletary … Other recent polls have shown a similarly competitive race, closer than any state governor contest since 2003. Republicans have controlled the governor's mansion since 2004. Mason-Dixon pollsters indicated Trump's scheduled Nov. 1 rally in Tupelo ‘could be a deciding factor’ and offer a ‘significant boost’ for Reeves with GOP turnout. They noted Trump's last-minute campaigning in Louisiana recently helped force incumbent Democrat John Bel Edwards into a runoff.”

“As American people, we do a lot of business in China. And they know and understand our values and we understand their values. And one of our best values in America is free speech.

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I’m at the point where I may hibernate this winter and avoid at all costs any media news. There are so many things I find biased, crooked and overblown, most of all the vendetta against the president. I resent the focus on this as opposed to a new trade policy, immigration reform, poor reports on education in the US, drugs and so many urgent items. Trump wasn’t my first choice for president in 2016, but I supported him when nominated. I don’t care nearly as much about his horrible personality as I do about his policies and the things he’s accomplished. … The polls say ‘Impeach! Elect Socialists! Elect people who are not only corrupt but suffering from delusions or dementia.’ I’m old, cranky and tired of the idiocy. Boo hiss.” – Susan Williams, St. Louis

“Something that is not talked about is, if college tuition became free in the United States is it reasonable for a college student to believe they can choose their college and/or major? One of the casualties of big socialized governments is there is no mechanism to afford personal individuality, uniqueness or desire. Everyone is treated the same. It then seems a reasonable conclusion that all students who want free college tuition to be tested, the government decide what the student demonstrates high aptitude in and the government choses the school and/or major for that student. This would be based on how the government decides the student can best serve the masses, not the individual student’s desires. In the United States we generally believe in mutually beneficial transactions. Meaning, both parties to a transaction receive something. One party receives the quantity and quality of a good or service, the other receives money. Both parties win. It would be a sea change to believe the student would receive both; free education and the choice of where to go and what to major in.” – Jim Hain, Omaha, Neb.



[Ed. note: Well, we do already kind of dabble in that. The federal government provides special incentives for students to choose certain disciplines and for institutions to choose certain types of students – directing research funds to preferred research, creating incentives for encouraging women into STEM, etc. But I take your larger point. If a four-year college degree becomes like high school is now, i.e. a guaranteed good available to all residents, one imagines that the government will take a similarly strong interest in what colleges teach and what students will earn. We have already seen it through the pressures applied to schools via Pell Grants and other forms of funding. But leaving aside the consideration of funding, which is a lulu, the main concern about universal college is that it will diminish the value of college for those who do attend. One of the reasons college has been such a great ladder into the middle class is that it isn’t for everyone. About a third of Americans over 25 have at least a four-year degree. But for Americans over 65, it’s only about a quarter of the population. It stands to reason that new graduates holding college degrees 40 years ago were more valuable than those today. What happens if we see college-going rates soar to 60 percent or more? There are lots of good things about higher education (and plenty of bad things, too). But many of the good things are not about what happens in the classroom – socialization, training in independent living in a controlled atmosphere, a sense of cultural belonging. Those things may or may not be degraded in a world of universal college. But the value of a degree, and thereby its utility for upward socioeconomic mobility, certainly would.]

Bloomberg: “America is sitting on a mountain of uneaten bacon. More than 40 million pounds (18,000 metric tons) of pork bellies, the cut used for bacon making, were sitting in refrigerated warehouses as of Sept. 30, according to U.S. government data released Tuesday. That’s the most for the month since 1971. The overhang came after a buildup in the American hog herd. Pork output surged over the summer months and through September, said Dennis Smith, senior account executive at Archer Financial Services Inc. Bellies have seen a magnified inventory increase because demand is mostly domestic, unlike cuts such as ham, for which overseas buying can help reduce reserves.”

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in 2020, former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus argued on Tuesday.

During an exclusive interview with Fox News, the longtime political strategist argued that Warren was too caught up in policy, not relatable enough, and so extreme that she would drive voters to support Trump.

""Without question,"" he would choose Warren as Trump's opponent. ""It's just this outlandish worldview that Elizabeth Warren has that will drive people that may not be thrilled with everything that President Trump is doing -- but under the circumstances of being given a choice between Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren, they're going to go with Donald Trump.""

""It's incredible how badly the Democratic party is screwing this up for themselves. It's amazing. They've got one left-wing nut after the next on television,"" he told Fox News.

WATCH: ELIZABETH WARREN DODGES QUESTION ON HOW SHE WOULD FUND 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

His comments came just days before he's set to sit down at Politicon with Fox News contributor Donna Brazile who, like Priebus, served as chair of her respective party during the 2016 presidential election. He will expand on the atmosphere surrounding 2020 and talk about the direction of the country. Priebus will also participate in a panel on Republicans’ electoral prospects following Trump’s first term at Politicon.

Voters in the U.S., Priebus told Fox, mostly weren't concerned with policies like reparations or ""Medicare for all."" Instead, they focused on issues like manufacturing and jobs. Priebus argued that voters would have a harder time deciding between Trump and candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, or Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was a ""close second"" behind Warren for Priebus' chosen nominee. “He’s a little Trumpy … I think his rhetoric flows well, better than Elizabeth Warren, with blue-collar workers in the midwest -- kind of his middle finger type philosophy to just a lot of things that folks claim is unfair,"" he said of Sanders.

According to Priebus, Trump and Republicans were ""brilliant"" to focus on the Democrats' more progressive elements like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and her ""squad"" of progressive freshmen. “There’s nothing more you want to do than give people a stark contrast in the ballot box -- so when people go to vote, they want to see night and day as far as a choice,"" he said.

He added that ""extreme"" Democratic policies in Washington, D.C., were making it more likely that reluctant Trump donors would pull out their checkbook and support his re-election.

But none of the party's frontrunners, he argued, were able to appeal to both a progressive base and midwestern voters. And although Biden was the more likable Democrat, he wasn't credible on left-wing policies, Priebus said.

""So, they have nothing. They don’t have a complete candidate who can do both which is why you’re seeing people like [Michael] Bloomberg dipping his toe in, you saw the poll last week about Michelle Obama -- that she would be the frontrunner. The Democrats are desperate,"" he said.

Biden's prospects, Priebus added, were much worse than Trump's were during the 2016 primaries. He argued that Trump ""was never really behind"" and, as a consequence, Republican National Committee delegates didn't have anywhere to go other than supporting Trump.

Biden, on the other hand, could face a brokered convention where he may need to shore up progressives due to the nature of Democratic politics. Democrats, he said, had “real tight race among three or four people and they also shell out most of their delegates on a proportional basis at their conventions … and in their primary battles.”

Priebus also put the kibosh on any chance that former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton could enter the race and win in 2020. ""I think she's pretty much-damaged goods at this point,"" he said. He argued that Warren faced the same flaw that Clinton did in 2016: neither were ""likable.""

Trump, he added, delivered on his promise to ""blow things up"" in Washington and was immune to the controversies that would doom any other politician. “He’s judged by the American people on a different standard. He’s immune from all of these controversies.""

On impeachment, Priebus argued that the president should continue playing ""the victim card"" and attacking the way Democrats handled it -- something he described as a ""sham."" Impeachment, he predicted, could turn out to be a boon for Trump, especially since the Ukraine controversy implicated Biden."

The Broncos traded Sanders and a fifth-round pick to the San Francisco 49ers for a third- and a fourth-round pick, according to KUSA-TV. The 49ers later confirmed the trade.

“I think eventually with what happened after the Tennessee game [a 16-0 victory] and where we were and with the value we were getting for him, we decided it was the best thing for our team to trade Emmanuel,” Elway said at a news conference without clarifying.

Sanders had one catch on three targets for zero yards. He left in the second half with a knee injury. Two weeks before the Titans game, he had five catches for 104 yards in a two-point loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Elway said that it was Sanders who requested the trade.

“When we looked at it, Emmanuel had issues and we had issues,” Elway said. “That is why it was a good time for us to go different directions — for Emmanuel to go in a different direction and for us to go in a different direction. With that being said, we were able to get the value that we thought was fair. That is why we decided to make the deal.”

Sanders was in the middle of his sixth season with the Broncos before the trade. He had 404 receptions for 5,361 yards and 28 touchdowns in 78 games for Denver. He had started 77 of the 78 games.

He told CBS Denver said he was happy with his time in Denver.

After all, the president is also struggling in the polls, battling his own party on Syria, and had to reverse himself on hosting the G-7 at his Florida resort.

But no, the Dems are nervous. So nervous, in fact, that they’re engaged in their quadrennial ritual of fantasizing.

MICK MULVANEY STRUGGLES AS WHITE HOUSE LEAKS SAY HIS JOB IS IN JEOPARDY

What superhero is ready to don a cape, swoop in to rescue them and capture the White House?

The media love such fantasies, of course, because it’s an exciting story line and the chance to pump up a new personality.

Remember when Oprah made a few comments and the press was seized by the idea that she could be president? The only problem was, well, she didn’t want to be president.

Now comes a New York Times report that Democratic donors and insiders are “fretting about who is in the race and longing for a white knight to enter the contest at the last minute.”

The reason, obviously, is a lack of confidence that any of the current field can defeat Donald Trump—who, even after a likely impeachment vote, is virtually certain to survive a trial in the Republican Senate.

The current polls show several Democratic candidates besting Trump, but that could look very different in the fall of 2020 after the nominee is battered by zillions in Republican advertising along with Trumpian attacks.

Joe Biden probably has the best chance to oust Trump, but there is rising concern that his uneven debate performances and anemic fundraising may sink his primary campaign. Biden could have dominated as the target of Trump’s Ukraine efforts, in my view, but he has still not done an interview since impeachment exploded.

Elizabeth Warren is viewed by the prognosticators as having the best shot at the nomination, but there is growing fear that she’s too far left to win a general election. Even as she’s taking a second look at Medicare for All, having ducked questions that it would force a middle-class tax hike, Warren is saddled with other positions that delight Democrats but could be viewed as socialistic in a general election.

If you assume that Bernie Sanders can’t win as a 78-year-old heart attack survivor, that leaves two moderate alternatives to Biden.

Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both had strong debate outings last week, and Mayor Pete has surged into third place in the latest Iowa poll. But neither seems a surefire bet to beat Trump. And thanks to Nancy Pelosi, both are getting far less media oxygen because of the overwhelming focus on impeachment.

So who do the Democratic dreamers want?

The Times says Sherrod Brown is getting a lot of calls (his wife confirms this). But if the Ohio senator thought he could win the nomination, he would already be in the race.

Eric Holder is toying with the idea of getting in. But Barack Obama’s attorney general has never won an election.

Mike Bloomberg? He was a very good New York mayor, but he threatens to run every four years and never does. He wound up deferring to Biden this time. He’s 77. Not happening.

Hillary? You know she’s thought about it. But she also knows she’s had her shot.

(Update: Oops! The Washington Post follows up today, saying: ""Hillary Clinton, according to two people close to her, has not ruled out jumping in herself, a sign that she is hearing similar dissatisfaction."")

Michelle Obama? I’m sure she’d look good in Democratic polls. One unnamed person “mused” about her to the Times. She was a popular first lady. But unlike Hillary, Michelle has never exhibited the urge to be a politician herself. I have the sense that she devoted eight years to public service and is happy to have her life back.

Late entries can kick up a fuss, but they never win, not after the current candidates have raised millions, set up organizations and developed their ground games.

On Tuesday, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced that the average premium for the Affordable Care Act benchmark plan would drop by 4 percent in 2020, with 20 more insurance plans becoming available on healthcare.gov.

HOUSE GOP RELEASE PLAN IN BID TO FULFILL TRUMP PROMISE AS 'PARTY OF HEALTH CARE'

CMS Administrator Seema Varna also testified on Capitol Hill Wednesday, during a House Energy & Commerce hearing titled: “Sabotage: The Trump administration’s attack on health care,” that in some states, premiums are dropping even more significantly.

In Delaware, premiums dropped 20 percent; in North Dakota premiums dropped 15 percent; and in Oklahoma, dropped 14 percent. Three states, though, -- Indiana, Louisiana, and New Jersey -- will see premiums increase 10 percent or more.

The Trump campaign told Fox News that those figures are a result of action taken by the administration over the last few years to make the Affordable Care Act more competitive, deliver more free-market principles, give consumers more options, and improve the ObamaCare marketplace.

“While Democrats continue to push the narrative that President Trump is trying to ‘sabotage’ their health care, the latest data confirm exactly the opposite,” Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told Fox News.

Democrats on the Energy & Commerce Committee on Wednesday, though, blasted the administration, claiming it was engaging in a ""concerted effort to cut back on people's health insurance, their benefits, and what kind of coverage they have.""

Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., said the administration is actively supporting a lawsuit that would overturn the Affordable Care Act and strip health care coverage from tens of millions of Americans and place ""extremely burdensome and sometimes illegal hurdles"" for Medicaid recipients.

""I am deeply concerned,"" he said.

2020 PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL SAYS WARREN IS LYING ABOUT HEALTH CARE PLAN: 'IT'S A SOUNDBITE'

Earlier this year, the administration told a federal appeals court that the program in its entirety should be abolished. Democrats criticized the administration and Republicans for trying to repeal protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

But the White House has touted a number of improvements under the ACA since Trump took office--including the administration's ability to ""make it easier for small businesses and self-employed workers"" to join and create Association Health Plans; the expansion of short-term, limited-duration plans that typically cost less than other ObamaCare options; the expansion of health reimbursement arrangements; and the elimination of the individual mandate, which forced Americans to buy health insurance, whether they wanted to or not.

This month, Trump signed an executive order that “directed HHS to take a number of specific, significant steps that will meaningfully improve the financing of Medicare, advance the care American seniors receive from their doctors, and improve the health they enjoy.""

But even as the Trump re-election campaign and Trump administration takes credit for the Affordable Care Act’s current stability, officials and Republican lawmakers are still pursuing Trump’s 2016 campaign promise of trying to do away with the program altogether.

This week, the Republican Study Committee released a health care plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, two years after the GOP was unable to agree on a health care plan to scrap ObamaCare during the first year of Trump’s administration.

The new 66-page framework also represents an effort to compete with 2020 Democrats pushing health care plans like ""Medicare-for-all."" The new plan looks to “transform the individual marketplace’s current regulatory structure, unwind the ACA’s Washington-centric approach and largely return regulatory authority to individual states.”

""Until Congress gets around to replacing it, the president will do what he can to fix the problems created by this system for millions of Americans,"" HHS Secretary Alexander Azar said. ""The president who was supposedly trying to sabotage this law has been better at running it than the guy who wrote it.""

As for 2020, Democratic presidential hopefuls like Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have blasted Trump for his handling of the health care system, and are peddling a sweeping ""Medicare-for-all"" policy.

Candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden have instead touted ObamaCare, and proposed building on the Obama-era health care overhaul, while criticizing Trump for his moves to eliminate it.

“Before Donald Trump even stepped foot into the Oval Office, he pledged to strip millions of Americans of their health care,"" Biden said in a statement released by his campaign earlier this month. “As Donald Trump continues attempting to tear down the Affordable Care Act, I will fight him every step of the way.”

Meanwhile, with regard to the lawsuit, a federal appeals court in New Orleans could deliver its ruling on the case during the sign-up season--spanning from Nov. 1 in most states through Dec. 15.

Azar said that he was not concerned, even if the judges rule to throw out the entire health care program.

""Our messaging would be to keep calm and carry on,"" he said, noting that the case is expected to go to the Supreme Court. ""There will be no immediate disruption to anyone.""

""People are voting for him so all these liberals that are all up in arms over the fact that he got through and someone else didn't,"" Priebus said Tuesday, before adding Spicer has a huge following ""because of Trump"".

The popular ABC show involves celebrities dancing with trained professionals and competing for votes to stay on the show. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who recently told Trump he would resign, competed on the show in 2016.

SARAH SANDERS SAYS HER WHOLE FAMILY VOTES FOR SEAN SPICER ON 'DANCING WITH THE STARS'

Since entering the show, Spicer has faced fresh criticism over his previous job as White House press secretary under Trump. ""I just remember him lying for the liar,"" ""The View"" co-host Sunny Hostin said in September. Her co-host, Joy Behar, similarly joked there could be a show called ""Dancing with the Liars.""

While speaking with Fox News, Priebus defended Spicer and pushed back on his critics.

""I think good for him. I think it's fun and for all those people that love to poke fun at Sean ... well, what have they ever done?""

He added that liberals would have to continue seeing Spicer on television whether they liked it or not.

""They're going to have Spicer for weeks on end.""

Priebus and Spicer both worked to get Trump elected in 2016 as they worked alongside each other in the Republican National Committee. Priebus, the party's former chair, indicated that he wouldn't follow his colleague's path to stardom.

The book, titled ""A WARNING,"" comes roughly a year after the senior official laid out his scathing attack. According to the publisher, the book will be released on Nov. 19 and pick up where the controversial op-ed left off.

""This explosive book offers a shocking, first-hand account of President Trump and his record,"" the publisher said on Tuesday.

Javelin's Matt Latimer and Keith Urbahn, both of whom represented former FBI Director James Comey on his book, are working with the author, whose identity is still unknown to the public.

The release is sure to spark yet another political firestorm in the nation, as the initial op-ed prompted intense media coverage and vehement denunciations from the White House.

WH OFFICIAL PENS ANONYMOUS NY TIMES OP-ED CALLING TRUMP 'ANTI-DEMOCRATIC,' 'PETTY AND INEFFECTIVE'

Titled ""I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration,"" the op-ed --which was published Sept. 5, 2018--revealed that the author and others in the administration wanted to undermine Trump's agenda. While the author distances themselves from the popular ""resistance"" movement, they also asserted that thwarting Trump was vital to the health of the nation.

""We believe our first duty is to this country, and the president continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our republic,"" the official said in the op-ed.

The op-ed took particular aim at the president's behavior, claiming he was ""erratic"" and had a fundamental ""amorality"" that plagued his administration.

""Anyone who works with him knows he is not moored to any discernible first principles that guide his decision making,"" it read.

Then-White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders responded by blasting the author's cowardice and calling on them to resign. It's unclear whether the official is still in the administration, but the book's release was the latest indication that Trump faced concerted opposition from within his own ranks.

""I think that there are nefarious actors all around us and people who work within the administration that hate the president. And those people should just decide to go somewhere else,"" Reince Priebus, former White House chief of staff, told Fox News on Tuesday.

Priebus said he had a ""few guesses"" on who he thought the author was and predicted their identity wouldn't remain a secret for much longer.

MATTIS DERIDES 'COWARDICE' FROM ANONYMOUS OFFICIAL WHO PENNED NEW YORK TIMES' ANTI-TRUMP OP-ED

""If someone comes out with a book and puts themselves in scenarios and situations, I think it's going to be rooted out pretty quickly who this person is,"" he said.

Latimer claimed that the author felt their identity was ""irrelevant.""

“The author feels their identity is almost irrelevant because there is scarcely a sentiment expressed in this book that is not shared by numerous others who have served and continue to serve this administration at its highest levels,"" Latimer said, according to The Washington Post.

As Latimer mentioned, the author didn't get an advance for the book. According to Twelve's release, they also pledged to donate royalties to non-profits that ""focus on government accountability and on supporting those who stand up for the truth in repressive countries around the world.""

Latimer also relayed that his client saw publishing the book as ""an act of conscience and of duty."""

The plan also represents an effort to compete with Democrats' messaging on ""Medicare-for-All"" and other health care plans as the 2020 Democratic primary campaign hits its stride.

The 66-page framework seeks to ""transform the individual marketplace's current regulatory structure, unwind the ACA's Washington-centric approach and largely return regulatory authority to individual states.""

This includes provisions to increase the portability of health insurance within the individual marketplace, provide federal funding for state-designed ""guaranteed coverage pools"" which would help cover individuals with pre-existing conditions -- though it does not require states to run such pools -- put a moratorium on Medicaid expansions so it can be ""sustainable ... for generations to come"" and promotes ""innovative care"" such as telemedicine.

""It is a plan that: PROTECTS the vulnerable,"" a statement attached to the plan says, ""especially those with pre-existing conditions; EMPOWERS individuals with greater control over their health care choices and dollars; and PERSONALIZES health care to meet individual needs and reduce premiums, deductibles, and the overall cost of health care.""

2020 PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL SAYS ELIZABETH WARREN IS LYING ABOUT HER HEALTHCARE PLAN: 'IT'S A SOUNDBITE'

Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., Rep. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz. Rep. Larry Buchshon, R-Ind., Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa. Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., Rep John Joyce, R-Pa., Rep. David Rouzer, R-N.C. and Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas all signed the document.

The health care portability provision, specifically, would extend similar protections to those moving from individual plan to individual plan as currently exist for those between employer-sponsored insurance plans. This, the framework's authors say, would prevent patients from being denied coverage while moving between individual plans, for example, while moving to a different state.

The RSC's document, which is not a bill but rather a list of ideas the RSC says will be hashed out through debate, also includes increased limits on health savings accounts. The RSC proposes uncoupling health savings accounts from high-deductible plans and raising the cap on such accounts to $9,000 for individuals and $18,000 for families, more than double what is allowed under current law.

The RSC framework does add one caveat to the use of health savings accounts, however.

SANDERS ACCUSES BIDEN OF PUSHING INSURANCE INDUSTRY 'TALKING POINTS' BY SLAMMING 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

""Critically, while the RSC plan would unleash health savings accounts, it would ensure that these accounts are pro-life and do not inadvertently allow a back-door method of subsidizing abortion procedures,"" the plan reads. ""Accordingly, the RSC plan would ensure these accounts cannot be linked to a plan that provides abortions, nor would abortions or abortion drugs be an eligible expense.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed the RSC's ideas, criticizing Republicans for not bringing Democrats into the fold on their plans to replace the Affordable Care Act.

""After 10 years of refusing to work with Democrats to #ProtectOurCare, the only plans offered by Republicans don’t cover & protect preexisting conditions,"" she tweeted Tuesday. ""They say their plan is an alternative to the Affordable Care Act but it’s really just an alternative to health care, period.""

The conservative organization Freedomworks, on the other hand, released a statement in support of the RSC's proposal, saying it would improve health care for consumers while also sticking to small-government principles.

“We’re thrilled to see a coalition in Congress with a health care plan that is based around individual choice and ownership of health insurance,"" Jason Pye, FreedomWorks Vice President of Legislative Affairs, said. ""The RSC plan also respects federalism by allowing states to decide how best to extend affordable coverage for their residents.

“From the large expansion of health savings accounts to the elimination of many provisions of current law that have made health insurance coverage so unaffordable, Americans across the country will benefit from the choice afforded to them by this plan."""

DEM ELITES SEARCHING FOR WHITE KNIGHT

NYT: “When a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered at the Whitby Hotel in Manhattan last week, the dinner began with a discussion of which presidential candidates the contributors liked. But as conversations among influential Democrats often go these days, the meeting quickly evolved into a discussion of who was not in the race — but could be lured in. Would Hillary Clinton get in, the contributors wondered, and how about Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor? One person even mused whether Michelle Obama would consider a late entry, according to two people who attended the event, which was hosted by the progressive group American Bridge. It’s that time of the election season for Democrats. ‘Since the last debate, just anecdotally, I’ve had five or six people ask me: ‘Is there anybody else?’ said Leah Daughtry, a longtime Democrat who has run two of the party’s recent conventions.”

Warren ups the ante another $800 billion - WSJ: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for $800 billion in additional federal funding for public education, a move that would exhaust the remaining revenue to be raised by her proposed wealth tax even as she seeks ways to finance Medicare for All. Ms. Warren outlined on the blog site Medium an additional $450 billion in Title I funding to boost schools with low-income students, $200 billion in grants for students with disabilities and $100 billion in other grants over 10 years. She also vowed to invest $50 billion in school infrastructure on top of existing funding for school upgrades that are in some of her other policy proposals.”



Castro promises to quit if he can’t raise $800,000 in 10 days - Politico: “Julián Castro on Monday threatened to suspend his presidential bid unless he can raise nearly $1 million by the end of the month. ‘If I can’t raise $800,000 in the next 10 days — I will have no choice but to end my race for president,’ Castro wrote in a fundraising email to supporters. ‘If I don’t meet this deadline, I won’t have the resources to keep my campaign running.’ The strategy is nearly identical to Cory Booker’s ‘radical transparency’ gambit last month, when his campaign warned in a memo to supporters that the New Jersey senator would end his White House bid if he was unable to raise $1.7 million in the final 10 days of September.”



Buttigieg’s sexuality a hurdle with black voters - The [Columbia, S.C.] State: “Internal focus groups conducted by Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign this summer reveal a key reason why he is struggling with African-American voters: many see his sexuality as a problem. The 21-page report, conducted by the Benenson Strategy Group with black Democratic South Carolina voters in mid-July and obtained exclusively by McClatchy, found that ‘being gay was a barrier for these voters, particularly for the men who seemed deeply uncomfortable even discussing it. … [T]heir preference is for his sexuality to not be front and center. While the report stated that Buttigieg’s sexuality was not a ‘disqualifier’ for these voters, some of the focus group participants questioned why Buttigieg even brought it up.’



Facebook ramps up election security efforts ahead of 2020 - AP: “With just over a year left until the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Facebook is stepping up its efforts to ensure it is not used as a tool to interfere in politics and democracies around the world. The efforts include a special security tool for elected officials and candidates that monitors them for hacking attempts. Facebook said Monday it will also label state-controlled media as such, label fact-checks more clearly and invest $2 million in media literacy projects. The company says it will add more prominent labels on debunked posts on Facebook as well as on Instagram. It will put labels on top of what are deemed ‘false’ and ‘partly false’ photos and videos.”

TIME OUT: ‘EVERYONE’S GOT THEIR THING’

NYT: “The pressures of sexual selection have made peacocks gorgeous, wood thrushes sonorous and birds of paradise great dancers. At first glance, the white bellbird doesn’t appear to have benefited similarly. Barrel-chested and big-mouthed, with a long wattle dangling from the top of its beak, this rainforest bird looks more like a Muppet than an avian Casanova. But everyone’s got their thing. According to a paper published Monday in Current Biology, this goofball boasts the loudest birdsong ever recorded. And he must be proud of it, because he sings the most piercing note right into potential mates’ faces. The white bellbird — one of four bellbird species in South and Central America — is a favorite among birders in Brazil. It has a ‘strange, metallic, kind of alien call,’ said Caio Brito, one of the founders of Brazil Birding Experts. When several sing at once, they are ‘deafening,’ and sound like ‘several blacksmiths trying to compete,’ said Arthur Gomes, a biology student at São Paulo State University who contributed to the new research.”

IMPEACHMENT TIMING GETS TRICKIER FOR HOUSE DEMS

NYT: “House Democrats have resigned themselves to the likelihood that impeachment proceedings against President Trump will extend into the Christmas season, as they plan a series of public hearings intended to make the simplest and most devastating possible public case in favor of removing Mr. Trump. Democratic leaders had hoped to move as soon as Thanksgiving to wrap up a narrow inquiry focused around Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine, buoyed by polling data that shows that the public supports the investigation, even if voters are not yet sold on impeaching the president. But after a complicated web of damaging revelations about the president has emerged from private depositions unfolding behind closed doors, Democratic leaders have now begun plotting a full-scale — and probably more time-consuming — effort to lay out their case in a set of high-profile public hearings on Capitol Hill.”



Diplomat who raised red flag on Giuliani-Trump deal testifies today - Reuters: “William Taylor, a former Army officer and career U.S. diplomat now leading the U.S. embassy in Kiev, will be the latest in a series of current and former officials to meet behind closed doors with the Democratic-led House of Representatives Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight Committees in the month since the probe began. Committee members and staff are examining whether the Republican Trump abused his office by improperly putting pressure on Ukraine to launch an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival and leading candidate for the Democratic 2020 presidential nomination. Taylor’s testimony is of particular interest to investigators because of his leading role at the embassy in Ukraine. He raised concern about military assistance being withheld from Kiev to put pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.”



Schiff un-censured - Fox News: “The Democratic-led House of Representatives voted Monday evening to table, or set aside, a resolution to censure House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., for his handling of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. The vote was 218 to 185 to table the resolution, which the Republican minority had introduced. All Democrats voted to table the censure resolution, with all Republicans voting against tabling. Independent Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, who left the Republican Party earlier this year, voted to table the resolution.”



President Trump draws ire of black lawmakers for ‘lynching’ claim - AP: “President Donald Trump enraged Democrats on Tuesday by comparing their impeachment inquiry to a lynching, assigning the horrors of a deadly and racist chapter in U.S. history to a process laid out in the Constitution. ‘That is one word no president ought to apply to himself,’ said Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the highest-ranking African American in Congress. ‘That is a word that we ought to be very, very careful about using’ he said. Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., called on Trump to delete the tweet.”



MICK MULVANEY: KICKING GAFFES AND TAKING NAMES

Reuters: “U.S. President Donald Trump has been fielding suggestions from allies on who might succeed his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, amid frustration at his team’s response to the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, two sources close to the White House said on Monday. Trump’s irritation at being dogged by a variety of issues - from impeachment to his decision to move U.S. troops out of northeastern Syria - was on display on Monday in the White House Cabinet Room as the president aired his grievances at length before his senior advisers and a group of reporters. The president has been focused in part on Mulvaney’s comments to reporters last week that Trump had withheld military aid from Ukraine in an effort to get Kiev to investigate a debunked claim about the 2016 U.S. election.”



Cuccinelli blocked from DHS job - AP: “President Donald Trump has been notified by his staff that he can’t select two popular figures — Ken Cuccinelli and Mark Morgan — to serve as an acting secretary of homeland security because a federal law governing agency succession makes them ineligible. Instead, Sean Doocey, the White House director of presidential personnel, in recent days gave Trump a list of other officials to consider as acting secretary, including top DHS official Chad Wolf and Transportation Security Administration chief David Pekoske, according to three people familiar with the conversation. The news has infuriated immigration hawks inside and outside the administration who had been lobbying for Cuccinelli to fill the role and now fear Trump will tap Wolf, a former chief of staff to ousted DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen who once worked as a lobbyist on employment visas.”



TRUMP LOOKS SOUTH FOR A BOOST

Politico: “Donald Trump is going all-in on a trio of Southern governor’s races in November, gambling that a clean sweep will help him regain his political footing at the most perilous moment of his presidency. Trump is expected to barnstorm Kentucky, Mississippi, and Louisiana over the next few weeks, while dispatching prominent supporters to help in each contest. And Vice President Mike Pence is planning a bus tour through eastern Kentucky, a pivotal area on the state’s political map that could decide the fate of Republican Gov. Matt Bevin. Trump badly needs a boost right now, and the White House sees the elections in the conservative states as the best near-term hope of achieving it.”



Impeachment adds windage to Kentucky contest - WSJ: “The gubernatorial election in Kentucky next month hinges in large part on whether voters are motivated by bread-and-butter issues close to home or national politics supercharged by the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. It is one of three governor’s races this year, along with those in Louisiana and Mississippi, that can offer insights on the electorate’s mood ahead of the 2020 presidential election.”

“I have come to fully realize something you told me when we met … a couple months ago. ‘Opinions are Luxuries: Have Only as Many as You Can Afford.’ Believe I’ve exceeded my budget and will have to cut back.” – Fred W. Apelquist III, Oak Hill, Va.



[Ed. note: You will be so glad you did! “Opinions are luxury items” is a close cousin to one of my dad’s favorites: “You can be happy or you can be right, but not usually both.” In our relationships it matters so much more that we listen and really hear each other. The simple but always challenging act of loving our neighbors starts by talking with them, which can’t happen if we’re talking at them. This not only makes us happier people and better friends, spouses and parents it also lets us save our strongest defenses for the things that matter the most.]

PICTURE DAY IS THE WURST

WSVN: “A 4th grader had a unique outfit for his school photo. Craig Arsenault posted a photo of his son Jake’s school ID. For his school photo, Jake dressed up in a hot dog costume. ‘My wife and I dared our son to wear a hot dog costume for school pictures. The school let him do it, and I couldn’t be happier,’ Arsenault said. According to Fox 13, Arsenault said the family had the costume “laying around for (the) last year,” and the idea came up when Jake voiced his wonder about what to wear for his school photo. ‘My wife suggested the hot dog costume. He was hesitant, so we bet him 10 bucks he wouldn’t do it,’ the father said. However, Jake accepted the dare and donned the costume for his photo. … Arsenault said he only had $7 at the time, which he gave to his son, but his son is holding him to the other $3.”

“…I offer the Krauthammer Conjecture: In sports, the pleasure of winning is less than the pain of losing. By any Benthamite pleasure/pain calculation, the sum is less than zero. A net negative of suffering. Which makes you wonder why anybody plays at all.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on June 29, 2017.

* In a bit of a surprise, CNN’s new national poll found Joe Biden leading Elizabeth Warren, 34% to 19%, in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. A month ago, Biden led Warren by a smaller margin, 24% to 18%. Bernie Sanders was third in the latest poll with 16%, down a point since CNN’s September poll.

* The same poll found Amy Klobuchar and Beto O’Rourke tied for sixth place with 3% each, which is important because it brings each of them a little closer to qualifying for next month’s primary debate. (The Minnesota senator needs just one more poll at 3% or greater to become eligible.)

* Speaking of polling, a new Quinnipiac poll, for the first time, found that a 48% plurality of Americans support impeaching Donald Trump and removing him from office. The same poll found the president with a 38% approval rating, down three points from the last Quinnipiac survey.

* In yet another poll, Emerson offered Bernie Sanders better news: it found Biden with a narrow lead over the Vermont senator nationally, 27% to 25%, with Warren close behind with 21%.

* Speaking of Warren, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney (D) endorsed the Massachusetts senator this morning. He’s the first big-city mayor to publicly announce his support for Warren.

* With only two weeks remaining in Kentucky’s gubernatorial race, William Woods, a Republican who ran against Gov. Matt Bevin in a GOP primary, this week announced his support for the governor’s Democratic challenger, state Attorney General Andy Beshear (D). “This election isn’t about politics for me,” Woods said on Monday night. “I’m ready for a governor who will respect all of us regardless of political affiliation.”

* Kansas Democrats’ U.S. Senate primary got a little more straightforward a few days ago, when former U.S. Attorney Barry Grissom ended his campaign and endorsed state Sen. Barbara Bollier (D). Bollier is perhaps best known as the former Republican who left the party over its radicalism.

* And the Washington Post’s Eugene Scott noted late yesterday that while some of Rep. Tulsi Gabbard’s (D-Hawaii) 2020 rivals have defended her from claims that she’s a Russian asset, “some have argued that Gabbard doesn’t have to be proactively working with Russia for that government to be using her campaign to interfere in the 2020 election.”"

* A new national Quinnipiac poll found Elizabeth Warren leading Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, 28% to 21%. (The previous Quinnipiac poll showed Warren with a more narrow, three-point advantage.) Bernie Sanders was third in the latest poll with 15%, and Pete Buttigieg was the only other candidate to reach double digits with a 10% showing.

* On a related note, Amy Klobuchar was sixth in the poll with 3%, which means the Minnesota senator has now qualified to participate in next month’s Democratic primary debate. For now, she’s one of nine candidates to meet the participation threshold.

* The latest Monmouth poll in South Carolina found Biden leading Warren, 33% to 16%, which is a much closer advantage than the same poll showed in July. Sanders is third in the poll with 12%.

* In Wisconsin, which is arguably the most important 2020 battleground state, the latest Marquette University Law School poll found Biden leading Donald Trump in the state by six points, 50% to 44%. The same results showed Sanders leading the president in the Badger State by two points, while Warren was up by one point. Marquette found Pete Buttigieg trailing Trump in a hypothetical matchup by two points.

* After briefly expressing tacit support for a presidential impeachment inquiry, Rep. Mark Amodei (R) has apparently lost his spot chairing Trump’s re-election campaign in Nevada.

* On a related note, though he wasn’t specific as to whom he was referring, Trump yesterday described his “Never Trump” Republican detractors as “human scum.”

* After Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) insisted that the Trump impeachment effort is a “lynching,” his Democratic rival, Jaime Harrison, raised $150,000 in one day for his 2020 campaign.

* And though I’m skeptical this will amount to much, Ed Stack, the CEO of Dick’s Sporting Goods and a longtime Republican donor, is reportedly weighing an independent presidential bid next year."

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., took a shot at South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg for suggesting that he would nominate independent-minded judges like former Justice Anthony Kennedy to the Supreme Court.

Buttigieg has been outspoken about his stance on expanding the Supreme Court in hopes of making it less partisan, but in an interview with Cosmopolitan, he shed some light as to the type of nominee he'd appoint as president.

""My appointments will definitely be people who share my values. But when I’m talking about the structure of the Supreme Court, I’m talking about something deeper,"" Buttigieg said. ""I’m talking about depoliticizing the Supreme Court Because right now, every time there’s a vacancy, there’s this apocalyptic ideological battle and it hurts the court and it hurts the country.""

Buttigieg went on to explain that he wanted justices ""who think for themselves"" and cited Kennedy and former Justice David Souter as examples.

""So I've floated several ideas and deliberately kept some level of open-mindedness about which ones are going to work best. One of them would be to have 15 members, but 5 of them can only be seated if the other 10 unanimously agree,"" Buttigieg continued. ""The idea here is you get more justices who think for themselves. Justices like Justice Kennedy or Justice Souter, and there are many legal scholars who think this could be done without a constitutional amendment under current law.""

The South Bend mayor faced backlash from the progressive left on social media with critics pointing to Kennedy's record on the Supreme Court -- including his votes with the majority on the landmark 2010 Citizens United campaign-finance case and in the ruling upholding the White House's travel restrictions affecting multiple Muslim-majority countries last year.

Sanders, the first 2020 candidate to weigh in on Buttigieg's remarks, was a bit more subtle with his criticism.

""Interesting, I’d like more justices like Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor,"" Sanders tweeted.

The Buttigieg campaign slammed the tweet that went viral, insisting it ""ignores"" how the candidate expressed in that same interview that he wants a nominee that shares his values.

""To be clear: Pete has consistently said he would appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who share his progressive values. Kennedy was not such a Justice,"" Buttigieg campaign rapid response communications director Sean Savett tweeted."

JUSTIN HASKINS: ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ PROVES AGAIN SHE HAS NO IDEA WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT

Yet the tragedy of our time is that these Democrats are being betrayed by their own party, by imposters who pretend to be Democrats but are not.

The truth is, freedom-loving Democrats and Republicans stand together against a third group that has infiltrated our national political parties – extreme leftists who openly reject the ideals expressed by the American founders.

Whether they call themselves democratic socialists or “woke” advocates for social justice, these authoritarian leftists have little in common with past leaders of the Democratic Party – people such as Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, along with governors like Ann Richards of Texas.

While Jimmy Carter said “the love of liberty is a common blood that flows in our American veins,” the new authoritarian leftists seek to do everything they can to restrict freedom, not expand it.

For Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a self-described democratic socialist who spent his honeymoon touring the Soviet Union, that means making private health insurance illegal and creating a “national wealth registry” to aid government confiscation of “excessive” wealth.

Of course, many, if not most, real Democrats are horrified by these leftist assaults on long-established American liberties.

For former Rep. Robert “Beto” O’Rourke, D-Texas, it means that all churches, synagogues, mosques and religious organizations that do not publicly accept gay marriage shall lose their tax-exempt status and not be allowed to participate in public life.

“There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone, or any institution, any organization in America that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us,” O’Rourke said at a CNN town hall Oct. 10.

For New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, it means passing a law making it a crime to use the words “illegal alien” in a way that can be construed as “demeaning,” punishable by a fine of up to $250,000.

Indeed, the new authoritarians seem to go out of their way to attack the Bill of Rights, especially freedom of speech, freedom of religion and the right to bear arms.

“I would love to regulate free speech,” Rep Ted Lieu, D-Calif., announced in a jaw-dropping admission on live TV a year ago. “The First Amendment prevents me from doing so.”

Realizing what he had just admitted to, Lieu quickly added that it’s probably better if government not regulate speech but, instead, “outsource” such censorship to big tech monopolies such as YouTube and Facebook. “I would urge these private sector companies to regulate it better themselves,” he said.

In the past, Democrats sought to use the power of the state to check the worst excesses of the free market, to provide a safety net for people in time of need, while simultaneously protecting the fundamental rights and responsibilities outlined in the U.S. Constitution.

In contrast, the imposters now taking over the Democratic Party want to abolish parts of the U.S. Constitution and replace them with something else — an alien ideology that gladly sacrifices basic civil liberties in the pursuit of allegedly higher ideals.

""Leftists are more likely than liberals to argue that economic inequality renders America’s constitutional liberties hollow,"" Peter Beinart wrote in The Atlantic. ""They’re more likely to look abroad — to the Soviet Union or Cuba in past eras, and to Scandinavia today — for alternatives to America’s political and economic models.""

Of course, many, if not most, real Democrats are horrified by these leftist assaults on long-established American liberties.

They are quick to say they are fighting for better wages and affordable health care, not a “Green New Deal” that could cost as much as $93 trillion.

Yet, if they are not careful, their party will soon be led not by pro-union Democrats such as former Vice President Joe Biden or Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, but by extreme leftist ideologues who care more about punishing churches for thought crimes than they do about creating jobs and better schools.

Charlie Chaplin, the iconic actor and at the time a well-known political leftist (some said communist), delivered a speech in San Francisco in 1941 prior to America’s entry into World War II.

As recounted in the biography of her parents – actress Fay Wray and screenwriter Robert Riskin – Victoria Riskin quotes from a letter her father, who heard the speech, sent to her mother: “(Chaplin) plunged into a speech extolling the Russians – their ideology (by saying that if communism produces men of such heroic stature, he’ll take communism, etc.). He resented the organized efforts for the last 20 years to present Russians as ogres both here and in England – and by God, if any man can’t get along on $25,000 a year, he is a cockeyed liar and a traitor to his country.”

According to some estimates, Chaplin had a net worth equal to $400 million when he died in 1977. Never mind.

NEWT GINGRICH: BYE DEMOCRATIC PARTY – YOU'RE BEING TRANSFORMED INTO AN ANTI-AMERICAN ENGINE OF RADICAL CHANGE

At the latest Democratic presidential debate, the millionaire Sanders and hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer had an exchange that came from a question about Sanders saying billionaires should be taxed out of existence to help close the “wealth gap.”

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

Sanders responded by ticking off his familiar litany of misery – half a million people living on the streets (he didn’t mention that many are in cities and states run by Democrats), the cost of education and student debt (he didn’t mention the many options for receiving an education that would substantially reduce student debt), 87 million uninsured, or underinsured (wasn’t ObamaCare supposed to fix that?), adding, “you also have three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society.”

Sanders called that a “moral outrage,” though on his moral scale, abortion on demand is not a problem.

Charging the rich with not paying their “fair share” in taxes is a distraction from the real issue: government spends too much.

For his part, Steyer sought some moral cover for his wealth, agreeing with Sanders and adding that corporations have “bought this government for the last 40 years.” Don’t those four decades include the Clinton and Obama administrations? Steyer said he would undo every tax cut for rich people and wealthy corporations.

We’ve heard it all before. The left would take from the prosperous and do what? Past welfare and redistribution programs haven’t liberated the poor. If they had, there should be fewer poor people. Wasn’t that the stated goal? Why didn’t it happen? The reason is the government is a bad charity.

What astounds is that younger people who buy into the “wealth gap” nonsense (because that is what they have had drummed into them by teachers and Democratic politicians) have little understanding of economics. There is no fixed amount of money from which all must draw. If there were it would be unfair for some to take (earn?) more than others. Wealth is a bottomless well. No one is destined to live permanently in the lower class.

The reason envy, greed and entitlement continue to surface in most election cycles is that it appeals to human emotions. Charging the rich with not paying their “fair share” in taxes is a distraction from the real issue: government spends too much.

In the letter to his wife, Robert Riskin wrote, “The Charlie (Chaplin) you once knew has been buried with honors -- and a new one has been born. Let’s hope the new one has everlasting life — for he will cling to it as long as that political philosophy remains popular.""

Sanders and Steyer seem to believe the Chaplin philosophy remains popular among some voters. Don’t include them, though, because they’re rich and you won’t see them sending a check to the Treasury.

The independent senator and 2020 presidential primary contender announced on Thursday his plan to legalize marijuana by executive order within the first 100 days of his administration should he win the White House.

Sanders, whose home state of Vermont in 2018 legalized possession of one ounce of pot and let each adult resident grow two plants for personal use, has long been a supporter of decriminalizing marijuana nationwide. He’s argued that the criminalization of the drug has ravaged communities of color and created an unequal incarceration rate.

“Too many lives were ruined due to the disastrous criminalization of marijuana,” Sanders wrote in a tweet announcing his plan.

Along with legalizing marijuana nationwide, Sanders also proposed expunging all past marijuana-related convictions and funneling some of the revenue from the legal marijuana business into communities hardest hit by the so-called War on Drugs.

“When we talk about criminal justice reform and ending institutional racism in America, we are talking about ending the disastrous War on Drugs, which has disproportionately targeted people of color and ruined the lives of millions of Americans,” his campaign said in a statement.

“It is time to admit the criminalization of marijuana was a disaster, especially for communities of color, and allow those most impacted to move forward with their lives. Our job now is to legalize marijuana and vacate and expunge past marijuana convictions, and ensure that revenue from legal marijuana is reinvested in communities hit hardest by the War on Drugs.”

Legalizing marijuana has gone from a once-fringe issue to a mainstream topic of debate as more states have let residents buy and grow pot.

OCASIO-CORTEZ, OMAR, TLAIB TO ENDORSE BERNIE SANDERS

Ten states and the District of Columbia already have legalized recreational marijuana, while there are only nine states in the nation where the drug remains fully illegal. Most states either have decriminalized it or have allowed it to be sold for medical uses.

A recent poll from Gallup found that 66 percent of Americans supported fully legalizing marijuana, almost double the number from 2005 when only 35 percent supported the move.

The sentiment across the country has been reflected among the 2020 Democrats with all supporting at least some form of legalization or decriminalization of the drug.

While Sanders was the first candidate to lay out an extensive plan for legalizing marijuana, fellow candidates and senators such as Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California have supported the Marijuana Justice Act. Introduced by Booker, the legislation would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and expunge existing cannabis-related criminal records.

The only major candidates who haven’t supported full legalization: former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

Biden said he supported decriminalization and rescheduling, criminal-record expungement and increased research access to marijuana, but argued it should be up to states to decide whether to legalize the drug. Klobuchar has said she supported decriminalization and legalization, but so far has not gone into specifics on her stance."

Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, grabs the support of 28 percent of Democrats and independent voters who lean toward the Democrats in a survey released Thursday by Quinnipiac University. Biden stands at 21 percent in the poll, with populist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 15 percent.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

In Quinnipiac’s previous survey – conducted prior to the Oct. 15 fourth round Democratic debate – Warren had a slight 30-27 percent edge over Biden. But her advantage was within the poll’s margin of error. Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House bid, was at 11 percent.

Quinnipiac’s new survey showing Warren with a clear lead outside the sampling error stands in stark contrast to a national CNN poll conducted by SSRS released a day earlier that suggested Biden at 34 percent, with Warren a distant second at 19 percent and Sanders at 16 percent. The former vice president’s 15 percentage point lead was his largest since April in CNN polling.

During the spring and summer Biden remained the unrivaled front-runner in the Democratic 2020 battle, but then Warren surged and has been tied with the former vice president in many national and early primary and caucus voting state polls this autumn.

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg grabs 10 percent support in the new Quinnipiac poll, with Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 5 percent and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota at 3 percent. According to Klobuchar’s campaign, their candidate has now reached the polling threshold and qualifies for the next debate, which will be held next month in Georgia.

No other candidate in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential contenders topped 1 percent in the poll.

""Former Vice President Joe Biden slips, Senator Elizabeth Warren steadies, Senator Bernie Sanders gets his groove back, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg breaks back into double digits,"" Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow said in a statement.

The survey indicates Biden is still viewed as the candidate who has the best chance of winning against President Trump in the 2020 election. But his electability has deteriorated, from a high of 56 percent days after he declared his candidacy in late April, to 42 percent now.

Thirty percent of those questioned say Warren has the best policy ideas, topping the rest of the field. And Sanders is viewed as the most honest Democratic White House contender, at 28 percent.

THE LATEST 2020 POLLING FROM FOX NEWS

Among the nearly three-quarters of those polled who said they either watched October’s debate or paid close attention to news stories about it, 26 percent said Warren did the best job, followed by Buttigieg with 17 percent, Biden with 12 percent, Sanders at 11 percent, and Klobuchar at 8 percent. When asked who did the worst job in the recent debate, 15 percent said Biden and 11 percent said Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii.

""Despite coming under attack at the debate, Senator Elizabeth Warren was viewed as doing the best job, followed by South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigeig, which may have helped his standing in the primary,” Snow said. ""Last week's debate didn't help Vice President Joe Biden.”

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted Oct. 17 - 21, with 1,587 self-identified registered voters — including 713 Democratic voters and independents who lean toward the Democratic Party, questioned by live telephone operators.

The video is Gabbard's latest response to Clinton's unsubstantiated suggestion that Gabbard was a ""favorite of the Russians"" in a recent interview. Clinton also claimed without evidence that Russians were ""grooming her to be the third-party candidate"" in the 2020 presidential election.

""Hillary, your foreign policy was a disaster for our country and the world -- resulting in the deaths and injuries of so many of my brothers and sisters in uniform, devastating entire countries, millions of lives lost, refugee crises,"" and more, Gabbard said.

""Yet despite the damage you have done to our country and the world, you want to continue your failed policies directly or indirectly through the Democratic nominee.""

She added: ""It's time for you to acknowledge the damage you have caused and apologize for it. It is long past time for you to step down from your throne so the Democratic Party can lead with a new foreign policy which will actually be in the interests of and benefit the American people and the world.""

Gabbard, an Army veteran who served in the Iraq War, had Monday said she's open to having a ""face-to-face"" with Clinton. This, after fellow presidential hopefuls Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.; former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and spiritual author Marianne Williamson pushed back on Clinton's suggestion that she's a secret Russian asset.

""Well, she had something to say about me, and I would have been very happy to have that conversation directly face-to-face with her,"" Gabbard, D-Hawaii, told reporters in Iowa.

President Trump on Monday also weighed in, telling reporters, ""She's [Clinton] accusing everyone of being a Russian agent.""

""She's not a Russian agent,"" Trump said of Gabbard. ""These people are sick. There’s something wrong with them.""

GABBARD, IN DEFIANT VIDEO, LINKS CLINTON 'SMEARS' TO HER PREVIOUS SANDERS ENDORSEMENT

On Sunday, the congresswoman posted a video and said she would not be silenced by Clinton and ""her gang of rich, powerful elite.""

""If they can falsely portray me as a traitor, then they can do it to anyone -- and in fact, that's exactly the message they want to get across to you,"" Gabbard said. ""If you stand up to Hillary and the party power brokers -- if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message. But, here is the truth: They will not intimidate us. They will not silence us.""

In 2016, Gabbard quit as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to support Sanders, and she accused party leaders of limiting her free speech and tipping the scales to favor Clinton's campaign.

She was warned that her endorsement of Sanders ""would be the end of my 'political career' -- they said Clinton would never forget,"" Gabbard said Sunday.

“The short of it is that she’s on a book tour and is feeling unconstrained about speaking her mind,” Clinton spokesperson Nick Merrill told Fox News on Monday. “It’s easy to over-ascribe a strategy about every word she utters, but it’s as simple as that. She’s out there telling the truth.”

Clinton has also been publicly hinting at a possible White House run in 2020 and made reference to a possible rematch last week while appearing on ""PBS News Hour."" She claimed she could beat Trump ""again.""

""So maybe there does need to be a rematch,"" Clinton added. ""Obviously, I can beat him again. But, just seriously, I don't understand, I don't think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.""

She replied to Trump's taunts on Twitter about her running again earlier this month and warned him not to ""tempt"" her.

Conservative commentator and Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro also raised the issue last week and said if Clinton had any desire to get in the race, now is the time.

""Honestly, if Hillary Clinton were to make her grand reentrance, now would be about the time she should do it,"" he said. ""Because the fact is, a lot of people are dissatisfied with [Joe] Biden. A lot of people are dissatisfied with [Elizabeth] Warren and Hillary is an enormous name.""

McEnany said the reports of Clinton considering another run show the weakness of the current field, which includes and ""Sleepy Joe"" Biden and ""radical socialism"" from Sens.

Shapiro pointed to Clinton becoming more vocal in recent weeks during a series of media appearances to promote a new book. He noted that Clinton went after 2020 candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, in the ""weirdest way,"" claiming the Iraq War veteran is a Russian asset.

Shapiro said the attack was ""exactly what [Gabbard] has been waiting for"" as she responded by calling Clinton ""the queen of warmongers"" and accusing her of being behind a campaign to sink her candidacy.

Overall, Shapiro said the Democratic presidential field, currently led by Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, is weak and Clinton sees an opportunity.

Robert Torricelli told “America’s Newsroom” Wednesday that nominating former Vice President Joe Biden as the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee would be problematic due to the lingering questions about his son's financial dealings with Ukraine and China.

“The problem Democrats are facing in this race is that if Joe Biden is the nominee, Hunter Biden becomes 'Hillary Clinton’s emails,'” Torricelli said, predicting that the side issue will dog his campaign as it did for the former secretary of state in 2016.

Torricelli’s comments came after a new CNN national poll showed Biden leading the field following a recent dip. According to the poll conducted by the market research firm SSRS, Biden has the support of 34 percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters, his widest margin since his campaign officially launched on April 25.

REP. JORDAN ON HUNTER BIDEN'S UKRAINE DEALINGS: 'THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNEW RIGHT FROM THE GET-GO THIS WAS WRONG'

Sen. Elizabeth Warren has 19 percent, with Sen. Bernie Sanders at 16 percent.

Host Bill Hemmer asked Torricelli if a similar case could be made about Warren's, D-Mass., far-left policy proposals. Torricelli argued that ""Hunter Biden’s consulting contracts in China"" are more problematic than Republicans accusing Warren of being a socialist.

Torricelli said he still views Warren as the front-runner and believes national poll numbers ""will correct themselves.""

""There is a Democratic core sympathy for Biden for what he has gone through that has boosted his numbers. This is still, in my opinion, an Elizabeth Warren race. She's the only one with the organization, she's got the money, she's got the message, she is focused,"" he said.

Last week, Hunter Biden broke his silence since his relationship with companies in Ukraine and China came under scrutiny.

In a nationally televised interview, Biden maintained he did nothing improper while he served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Biden, 49, told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that accepting the lucrative position was, in retrospect, ""poor judgment.""

Biden said he did not discuss the Burisma Holdings board seat with his father, except for one ""brief exchange"" that was previously reported.

Weld, who was 2016 Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson's running mate, told Neil Cavuto Wednesday on ""Your World"" he is also seeing electoral headway in New Hampshire ahead of that state's 2020 primary.

""I think the president is too out of control for this country,"" he said.

""Things are moving in New Hampshire. I came up 28 points against the president in a head-to-head in the last 30 days... The president doesn't help himself when he goes three-for-three on making America look like an unreliable ally.""

BILL WELD 'THRILLED' OTHER REPUBLICANS ARE CHALLENGING TRUMP IN PRIMARY

In that regard, Weld claimed Trump has weakened America's standing in the world through his treatment of the Kurds in the Middle East, Ukraine, and most recently Iran.

Weld claimed the president is ""begging"" to get back to the negotiating table with Tehran.

He later laughed heartily when Cavuto asked about the president's recent tweets -- one of which claimed Republicans who don't support him are ""human scum,"" and another that labeled frequent critic Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, a ""pompous ass.""

""I think that he just is so unreliable and just can't stick to a story, and particularly not a true story,"" he said.

Regarding his primary battle with Trump, Weld said he is honing in on both New Hampshire and Super Tuesday states.

He rejected the claim his candidacy could be seen as hurting the Republican Party.

""They say everyone's got to be loyal and rally around the flag [but] too often, particularly in Washington, D.C., loyalty is nothing but an excuse for doing the wrong thing,"" he said.

He called progressive Democratic presidential hopefuls Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., ""not currently electable in the United States,"" but added Trump's reelection would be ""perhaps a bigger risk than those two Democrats -- who would not be able to get anything through Congress.""

During the interview, Weld and Cavuto also discussed whether his focus on New Hampshire has parallels to then-Sen. Eugene McCarthy's, D-Minn., surprise primary performance there in 1968 -- which lead incumbent President Lyndon Johnson to later drop out of the race. The 1968 Democratic nomination eventually went to Johnson's vice president, Hubert H. Humphrey.

""I'm looking for 50 percent, not 40 percent. Pat Buchanan got 37, Gene McCarthy got 41 and they knocked people out of the race, but I have in mind Super Tuesday,"" Weld said."

Kilmeade said traditional Democrats are concerned that proposing free health care for illegal immigrants, potentially taking away private insurance in favor of a ""Medicare-for-all system"" and imposing a Green New Deal on the energy industry will not appeal to voters in the middle.

But the former vice president’s lead is taking a hit as top-tier rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s support soars in the contest the Biden campaign sees as a firewall.

Biden – who has longstanding ties in the state – stands at 33 percent among South Carolina voters likely to cast a ballot in the state’s February primary, according to a new poll from Monmouth University. That’s down 6 percentage points from Monmouth’s previous survey in the Palmetto State, which was conducted in July.

THE LATEST 2020 POLLING FROM FOX NEWS

Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, stands at 16 percent in the survey, a jump of 7 points from July.

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is in third in the new poll, at 12 percent. The populist independent senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House bid stood at 10 percent in the previous survey.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who stood at 12 percent in the July survey, saw her support drop in half and now comes in at 6 percent in the new poll.

Environmental and progressive advocate and former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer has the backing of 4 percent of likely South Carolina Democratic primary voters, with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 3 percent, and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang each at 2 percent. The remaining nine candidates in the record-setting Democratic presidential field all register at 1 percent or less.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Besides the topline findings, the poll also has warning signs for Biden among South Carolina’s black voters, who make up more than half of the likely Democratic primary electorate. The former vice president’s position as either a first- or second-choice candidate dropped by 10 points among black voters to 52 percent, while Warren’s position as a top-two choice contender jumped 11 points to 26 percent.

“Biden is still in a pretty good position in South Carolina, but there are some signs that he might not have a true firewall among black voters. If he does not do well in the earlier contests in February, there may be potential for current preferences to shift here,” Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray said in a statement.

""I think I met with every one of the parents,"" he continues, ""and ... the families of those who were lost.""

But JT Lewis, 19, whose brother Jesse, 6, was killed in the attack, which happened just 11 days before Christmas, says former President Obama met with each of the grieving families after the Newtown shooting — not Biden.

“This is a lie,” Lewis writes in a Twitter message about Biden’s claim. “Obama came to Sandy Hook and met with every family. Joe Biden DID NOT.

“In fact,” Lewis adds, “my family was not allowed on Air Force One because we refused to support Obama/Biden gun control efforts.”

Biden addressed Sandy Hook family members June 15, 2016, CBS News reported, but it was unclear whether all families were represented.

In another post, Lewis reminds his followers of another instance in which Biden got his facts wrong regarding a school shooting.

He refers to an incident from August of this year, when Biden claimed to have been vice president at the time of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead.

Gaffes have been one area of concern for the Biden campaign, which has been losing momentum in recent weeks. Other topics that have some supporters worried include increased scrutiny of Ukraine business dealings that involved Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.

“I have, a handful of times, a long time ago, and I’ve also encountered a lot of people whose lives have really been shaken by the old war on drugs approach,” Buttigieg told Fox News in Las Vegas.

Nevada legalized marijuana for recreational use in 2017. Several other states have made similar moves, although the drug is still considered illegal on the federal level.

Buttigieg's ambitious proposal has been to “decriminalize all drug possession” while expanding access to addiction treatments and improving drug-abuse and mental-health treatment.

Buttigieg also said legalizing pot would carry numerous business advantages.

“First of all, without legalization, you’re going to continue to see a patchwork of different state laws that create a lot of problems for legitimate businesses like this one,” Buttigieg said outside the Top Notch dispensary in Vegas on a campaign stop.

He added, “We not only need to legalize but we also need to pursue experiments, knowing the racial disparity and lives that have been ruined by sentences over marijuana possession.”

Other 2020 Democrats seemed to be on the same page.

Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke toured an Oakland, Calif., dispensary last month, and called for allocating monthly stipends to people who were previously locked up for low-level marijuana offenses as a form of recompense.

Meantime, other candidates have admitted to using the drug before. California Sen. Kamala Harris, in a radio interview earlier this year, said, “I have, and I inhaled -- I did inhale. It was a long time ago, but yes.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders, when running in the 2016 primaries, also acknowledged he tried it a couple of times.

“I smoked marijuana twice — didn’t quite work for me,” he told Yahoo! News.

Candidates have split over how they would legalize marijuana federally. Buttigieg said it would need to be done through the proper legislative channels, while Sanders has expressed that he would use an executive order to carry it out.

Buttigieg agreed that the stigma surrounding marijuana use should diminish.

He also made a pitch specifically to veterans. “Yeah, so I've met a lot of veterans who rely on cannabis for the treatment of diagnosed or undiagnosed issues, often service-connected issues like post-traumatic stress. And, another benefit of decriminalization is, it could pave the way for this to be supported with” the Department of Veterans Affairs.

CLINTON-GABBARD CLASH RAISES ROLE ABOUT 2016 NOMINEE'S ROLE IN 2020 RACE

Yang made his comments while taking questions from reporters Tuesday evening in Hollis, N.H., and Wednesday morning after headlining ‘Politics and Eggs,’ a must stop for White House hopefuls campaigning in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state.

His swing through the Granite State comes days after Clinton firmly inserted herself into the 2020 campaign – arguing without evidence that Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii is a “Russian asset,” and mocking President Trump’s direct interactions with foreign leaders.

Gabbard, in a blistering video released over the weekend, suggested that Clinton had “smeared” her as payback for the Hawaii congresswoman’s endorsement of Sanders in the marathon 2016 Democratic presidential primary battle.

The former first lady, senator from New York and secretary of state, and the first major-party female presidential nominee has remained in the spotlight after winning the 2016 national popular vote but losing the election and the White House to Trump. And she’s served as a longtime foil for Republicans.

But her comments and actions in recent days have elevated her relevance in the 2020 campaign to a new level – renewing questions about her role in the race for the White House and sparking some speculation that she still has ambitions to mount a third bid for president.

Yang said that “nominees of the party from past cycles remain very important figures in the party, in that Hillary would have a lot of value to add.”

But he then emphasized that “she's not a candidate and it strikes me as a little bit inappropriate for her to be commenting directly about candidates since we're all Democrats. And you think that she’d be neutral unless she decided to endorse a particular candidate.”

WARREN SAYS SHE'LL SOON RELEASE PLAN ON HOW TO PAY FOR HER MEDICARE FOR ALL PROPOSAL

On health care, Yang announced that “we’re going to release a detailed health care plan in the days ahead.”

And specifically on the ""Medicare-for-all"" proposal introduced in the Senate by Sanders and backed by Warren, Yang said: “I support the spirit of what Bernie is trying to accomplish. I do think that outlawing private insurance in a very short period of time is a bit too disruptive, and I would not do it.”

He reiterated that “I've been on the record for a long time saying that there would be a role for some private insurers in my plan. I think most private insurers will disappear if we do a good enough job with the public plan, but that there would be some companies that genuinely do add value and adapt to the new circumstances.”

As Yang arrived in New Hampshire, his staff in the state was in the process of expanding. Yang’s team in the crucial early-voting state stood at around 15 at the beginning of the month, but a senior adviser told Fox News they planned to add at least 10 new hires by the end of October or early November.

Yang’s campaign has been fueled by his unconventional style and his push for what he calls the ‘Freedom Dividend,’ a universal basic income system that would pay all adult Americans $1,000 per month. The plan would help Americans cope with the loss of jobs due to the increased impact of automation and artificial intelligence.

Asked if he’d be open to serving as the Democratic Party’s running mate if he fails to win the nomination, Yang told Fox News “my goal is to solve the problems of the 21st century. I believe the best way I can do that is as president. But if it's in some other capacity, I'd be open to that. The goal is really just to make sure that this country is in a condition that I'm proud to pass along to my kids.”

Yang, along with many other of the Democratic presidential candidates, has disavowed outside super PACs as he pledges to combat the influence of dark money in politics. But a new group – called the Math PAC – has vowed to raise and spend at least $1 million in support of Yang’s campaign.

Yang told Fox News and CBS News that “I know very little about the Math PAC, genuinely.”

“I'm not going to try and dissuade them, because we have the rules that we have. After I'm president, I'm very happy to repeal Citizens United and try and do away with super PACs entirely. But given the rules that we have right now, my goal is to compete and to win and so I'm not going to dissuade private citizens from trying to help,” he added.

Yang’s come a long way since the early days of his campaign, when the outsider and first-time candidate was the longest of long shots. He said he now feels like he’s being taken seriously by the Democratic establishment

“I've been thrilled by the momentum that the campaign has gotten; certainly we might have started as something of a newcomer/outsider, but I feel like I'm becoming more and more part of the establishment, as we get more support,” he noted.

But there continue to be moments when the candidate – who’s qualified for all of the presidential primary debates to date – is snubbed by the mainstream media.

His supporters, known as the Yang Gang, have started a trending hashtag on Twitter dubbing what they are calling unfair coverage of the candidate a #YangMediaBlackout. The latest example they cite is The Weather Channel, which did not invite Yang to participate in their climate change special set to air Nov. 7.

“Another mystery, given that by any objective standard, I am either fourth, fifth or sixth in this race. And so why would you invite, I believe, nine candidates or ten candidates and not invite Andrew Yang? I do not know. I have a very extensive climate change plan. I like the Weather Channel just as much as the next American,” Yang told Fox News when asked about the lack of an invite."

HILLARY CLINTON BACKS OUT OF DC EVENT ALSO SET TO INCLUDE TULSI GABBARD, KIRSTJEN NIELSEN: REPORT

Clinton in recent weeks has privately stated she would enter the 2020 presidential race if she were certain she could win, The New York Times reported Tuesday. The story, titled “Anxious Democratic Establishment Asks, ‘Is There Anybody Else?’,” said about a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered in New York City questioned whether former front-runner Joe Biden could stand strong against Trump, citing Biden’s lackluster debate performance in Ohio last week.

They also raised concerns about Biden's fundraising struggles and his need to defend his family’s business dealings in Ukraine amid the ongoing Trump impeachment inquiry.

They also said Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders were likely too liberal to win the general election.

Meanwhile, The Washington Post, citing unnamed sources, reported that Clinton was considering a 2020 rematch against Trump after the State Department concluded this week there was ""no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information"" regarding Clinton's use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state.

The same State Department report, however, found dozens of individuals were at fault for mishandling classified information and found hundreds of security violations during her 2009-2013 tenure.

Clinton, the first woman to win a major party presidential nomination – and the national popular vote leader with almost 3 million more votes than Trump – remains a popular figure in her party, even after enduring criticism for losing key Midwestern states in 2016. For Republicans, she's a perennial target — currently in the Mississippi governor's race, where Democratic nominee Jim Hood, a longtime attorney general, is being attacked for acknowledging he voted for her over Trump.

Clinton’s supporters within the Democratic establishment have also passed around an op-ed published earlier this month in the San Francisco Chronicle by former Mayor Willie Brown titled: “Who should run against Trump? How about Hillary Clinton?” The Washington Post reported.

Both the Post and the Times reported that Clinton was not the only possible last-minute candidate on Democrats’ minds. Also being considered were: former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Disney chief executive Bob Iger, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and former first lady Michelle Obama.

The event, to be co-hosted by The Washington Post on November 20, marks MSNBC's second debate gig this election cycle.

Maddow will be joined by MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell, NBC News White House correspondent Kristen Welker and Washington Post White House reporter Ashley Parker, an all-woman panel of moderators, the network said.

NBC raised eyebrows for including Maddow, who drew ratings for its cable network for pushing what critics have described as ""conspiracy theories"" during the two-year Russia investigation, as a debate moderator earlier this year as such a position is usually assigned to serious, unbiased journalists.

Maddow's debate performance was widely criticized for keeping much of her focus on the findings of then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report.

MSNBC OPINION HOST RACHEL MADDOW'S DEBATE PRESENCE WAS 'A LOSS FOR JOURNALISM,' CRITICS SAY

""One would think that NBC News, which purports to be a news organization, would go above and beyond to make sure its hosts’ line of questioning was fair and honest, especially given the backlash the network received for its decision to have a far-left pundit moderate a presidential debate,"" BlazeTV White House correspondent Jon Miller told Fox News.

Others slammed the ""conspiracy theorist"" on social media, saying her presence at a presidential debate was a ""disgrace.""

NBC has been under fire in recent weeks in the wake of the reporting from ""Catch and Kill"" author Ronan Farrow, who detailed the network's efforts to kill his Harvey Weinstein story and the alleged yearslong misconduct from its former star anchor Matt Lauer.

NBC NEWS REPORTEDLY RENEWS NOAH OPPENHEIM'S CONTRACT, DRAWING OUTRAGE: 'STATUS QUO HAS BEEN BLESSED'

Last week, a prominent women’s group called on the Democratic National Committee to pull its upcoming debate from MSNBC unless NBC News ""cleans house"" and launches an independent investigation into ""allegations of a culture of sexual abuse"" at the network.

UltraViolet Action, a leading national women’s organization, claimed the Democrats' fifth presidential debate shouldn’t happen if NBC didn't ditch its beleaguered leadership.

""The DNC needs to make it clear that they support survivors of sexual abuse and cancel the upcoming 2020 Democratic presidential primary debate on MSNBC until Comcast and NBC News take clear steps to clean up the toxic culture that exists across their networks,"" UltraViolet co-founder Shaunna Thomas said in a statement.

On Wednesday, a group of activists and sexual assault survivors from the organization held a protest outside NBC News' New York City headquarters.

The group called for NBCUniversal to fire NBC News president Noah Oppenheim, MSNBC president Phil Griffin and ""every other person in leadership that enabled abusers and silenced survivors"" at the Peacock Network.

""It's not just a Matt Lauer problem. It's a company-wide problem, and it's one that Comcast NBC needs to take seriously and demonstrate that they're taking seriously,"" Thomas said outside NBC’s famed 30 Rock.

Speaking at the Fortune Most Powerful Women dinner at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington on Tuesday night, Gabbard said a lack of clarity could “undermine the integrity” of the investigation.

“Pursuing impeachment for partisan reasons is bad for our country,” she said. “It will be extremely divisive for an already divided country. I looked at the complaint and was very concerned. We need to get to the bottom of it.""

“There needs to be a transparent and narrowly focused inquiry -- I am disappointed with the lack of transparency,"" she said. ""They have been behind closed doors.""

“That has the potential to undermine the integrity of a nonpartisan investigation,” the congresswoman explained.

Gabbard’s appearance came just after she fired the latest shot in her ongoing feud with Hillary Clinton.

In a new campaign video released Tuesday, Gabbard assailed Clinton, calling for her to ""acknowledge the damage you've caused"" and ""step down from your throne.""

The video is Gabbard's latest response to Clinton's suggestion that Gabbard was a Russian asset and ""favorite of the Russians"" in a recent interview.

Clinton also claimed that Russia was ""grooming her to be the third-party candidate"" in reference to Gabbard's 2020 candidacy.

""Hillary, your foreign policy was a disaster for our country and the world -- resulting in the deaths and injuries of so many of my brothers and sisters in uniform, devastating entire countries, millions of lives lost, refugee crises,"" and more, Gabbard said.

""Yet despite the damage you have done to our country and the world, you want to continue your failed policies directly or indirectly through the Democratic nominee.""

She added: ""It's time for you to acknowledge the damage you have caused and apologize for it. It is long past time for you to step down from your throne so the Democratic Party can lead with a new foreign policy which will actually be in the interests of and benefit the American people and the world.""

Gabbard, an Army veteran who served in the Iraq War, had Monday said she's open to having a ""face-to-face"" with Clinton. This, after fellow presidential hopefuls Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.; former Texas Rep.

""Time to fire up your heating system ... but I do hope you've got nat[ural] gas rather than home heating oil because, it's much cheaper,"" he said.

The average U.S. household pays $580 annually to heat their homes using natural gas, explained Varney, contrasting the low number to the $1,501 annual cost that home heating oil would accrue.

VARNEY WARNS 2020 DEMOCRATS AFTER REPORTS SHOW MIDDLE-CLASS INCOMES SPIKING UNDER TRUMP

""Give me that natural gas, please,"" he said.

According to the Department of Energy, the U.S. recently claimed the title as the world's leading natural gas producer.

""The Energy Department is committed to safe development of America’s natural gas resources. Among our efforts, we invest in innovative research projects, explore ways to develop natural gas from methane hydrates and support deployment of natural gas-powered alternative fuel vehicles, which are ideal for high-mileage, centrally fueled fleets that operate within a limited area,"" the DOE said of their efforts.

VARNEY: TRUMP SPEECH IN NATURAL GAS-RICH STATE MAY TURN THE TABLES ON DEMOCRATS

Many climate activists are quick to criticize the controversial energy method, which is obtained through a process known as fracking.

Fracking is the advanced process of extracting natural resources from deep below the earth by pumping thousands of gallons of water, chemicals, and sand into a deep well at extremely high pressure, creating cracks in methane-bearing shale, and allowing the gas to flow to the surface.

According to Varney, the U.S. currently holds the title of the ""King of nat gas fracking,"" as emissions from carbon dioxide have been greatly reduced in recent years.

VARNEY SLAMS 2020 DEMS' CLIMATE CHANGE CONTRADICTIONS

Listing the many benefits of switching to natural gas, Varney said he ""feels sorry"" for those living in states who haven't yet embraced the less expensive gas option, and slammed New York State officials for not allowing pipelines to transport natural gas from neighboring Pennsylvania.

""You have to feel a little sorry for people who live in states run by climate warriors,"" Varney said.

Many 2020 Democratic candidates have been vocal about their opposition to ""nat gas fracking"" as part of their climate change solution, specifically candidate Bernie Sanders, who said ""any proposal to avert the climate crisis must include a full fracking ban on public and private lands.""

Varney issued strong warnings to 2020 Democrats, saying ""voters will not look kindly on a fracking ban... and on expensive heating oil being shoved down their throats.""

""Voters everywhere have been rejecting costly climate dreams,"" he said.

""If there were a free vote and people could say yes or no to cheap energy, I'm pretty sure there will be a very strong yes vote,"" Varney continued.

""President Trump knows that,"" he concluded. ""The Democrats are still dreaming.""

O'Grady and a panel of experts broke down some of the biggest proposals coming out of the current field of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates and how the ideas can be financed.

""Let's take Elizabeth Warren. She's promising $40 to $50 trillion in new spending over the next 10 years,"" said Brian Riedl, an economic policy expert and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. ""Let's assume $30 trillion of that can't come from the rich.""

STUART VARNEY ON KEEPING HOME HEATING BILLS DOWN THIS WINTER

""According to the Congressional Budget Office,"" continued Riedl. ""In order to raise $30 trillion, you would need either a payroll tax of 33 percent on top of the current 15 percent payroll tax. You're looking at about a 48 percent total payroll tax.""

""Or you could do a value-added tax, which is essentially a national sales tax, which is the other way Europe funds their welfare states,"" he suggested. ""You would need a 78 percent national sales tax to fund a $30 trillion agenda.""

""Are you saying that the government would take almost half of the income that your employer gives you? They would take that out even before you see that paycheck?"" asked O'Grady.

""That's correct. It would go from 15.3, which it is today, to nearly 50 percent for a payroll tax. That means ... nearly half of your paycheck would be taken out in the payroll tax. And of the remaining half, you're still paying the income tax. And when you go shopping, you're going to be paying sales tax. If there's a VAT tax, you're paying that. The cumulative effect of these taxes would be absolutely enormous,"" said Riedl.

""You can't get the proponents of these policies to talk openly about the taxes they require,"" he said, ""because once the American people find out what they cost, once they find out that Medicare-for-all isn't a free lunch -- support is going to collapse.""

During the last Democratic presidential debate in Ohio, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar took Warren to task, saying: ""At least [Sen. Bernie Sanders is] being honest here in saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes will go up.

Tulsi Gabbard and Hillary Clinton.

The feud is also good news for Gabbard, D-Hawaii, whose presidential candidacy is on life-support. She is supported by only 1.3 percent of Democrats in the latest RealClear Politics average of presidential primary polls.

But thanks to her feud with Clinton, Gabbard is attracting heavy media coverage – something she desperately needs to give her dark horse presidential candidacy any chance of success.

TULSI GABBARD TO HILLARY CLINTON: 'STEP DOWN FROM YOUR THRONE'

Gabbard added fuel to the feud Tuesday when she released a new campaign video attacking Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee. And Gabbard tweeted: “@HillaryClinton your foreign policy was a disaster for our country and the world. It’s time for you to acknowledge the damage you have caused and step down from your throne.”

The Clinton-Gabbard battle burst into the headlines last week, when Clinton said in an interview that the Russians have “got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate.”

“She's the favorite of the Russians,” Clinton added. “They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.”

While Clinton didn’t name Gabbard, it was clear that the former first lady, senator and secretary of state was referring to the Hawaii congresswoman.

Clinton also said that 2016 Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein was a “Russian asset” – a charge Stein denied and called “a ludicrous, unhinged conspiracy theory with no basis in fact.”

Gabbard posted a video Sunday denouncing Clinton and saying she would not be silenced by Clinton and ""her gang of rich, powerful elite.""

Trump couldn’t resist getting into the middle of the feud Monday, telling reporters that Clinton is “accusing everyone of being a Russian agent.” The president added that Gabbard is “not a Russian agent.”

And other Democratic presidential candidates – including Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and author Marianne Williamson – said they don’t believe Gabbard is a Russian asset.

Enough with this Democrat-on-Democrat fighting!

The Democratic presidential candidates need to be clear that their opponent is Donald Trump – not each other.

This latest infighting is a distraction and is turning off voters. If Democrats spend a lot of time and energy attacking each other in a civil war, Trump will have a much better shot at reelection, enabling him to cause even greater harm to our nation than he has caused already.

In 2016, the bitter race for the Democratic presidential nomination – which ended with Clinton defeating Sanders – led some Democratic voters to stay home or vote for Trump. This may have given Trump the margin he needed to win the presidential race in the Electoral College, even though Clinton had about 3 million more popular votes.

My fellow Democrats have to ask themselves: Are we going to support each other despite our personal or political differences so that we can send Trump into political retirement? Or is the temptation to tear each other down and highlight our differences more important? If we choose the latter, we’ll most likely lose – just like we did in 2016.

Is there any merit to Hillary Clinton’s accusations against Gabbard and SteinIf Democrats spend a lot of time and energy attacking each other in a civil war, Trump will have a much better shot at reelection, enabling him to cause even greater harm to our nation than he has caused already.

If Democrats spend a lot of time and energy attacking each other in a civil war, Trump will have a much better shot at reelection, enabling him to cause even greater harm to our nation than he has caused already.

Stein received about 1.5 million votes in 2016, but reports have come out of Congress showing that Russian election meddling directly contributed to that total. And of course, many of us remember the famous photo of Stein sitting at the same table as Russian President Vladimir Putin back in 2015.

As for Gabbard, it’s no surprise that she’s not a huge Clinton fan nor vice versa. In 2016, the congresswoman resigned as the vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee in order to endorse Sanders in his nomination fight against Clinton.

There are plenty of reasons Gabbard is barely registering in the polls.

For example, in 2016 Gabbard advocated that the U.S. work with Syria’s brutal dictator Bashar Assad, who has used chemical warfare against his own civilian population in the Syrian civil war. An estimated 400,000 people have been killed in the civil war, which began in 2011, and about 5.7 million Syrians have fled their country to escape the fighting, according to the U.N.

In 2017 Gabbard even traveled to Syria and met with Assad.

Additionally, according to news reports, Twitter bots that seem to originate in Russia have been quite active on Gabbard’s behalf. And Russian state media have been giving her a disproportionate amount of coverage, considering she is barely registering in the polls.

But all this aside, should the Democrats be talking about this? Should Hillary Clinton have said anything about Gabbard? And should Gabbard have responded?

No, no and no.

For the sake of the American people – who need to replace Trump because his failed leadership, divisiveness and erratic behavior are causing more and more serious problems for our country and the world – I hope Clinton and Gabbard stop attacking each other. They need to use all their energy to concentrate on making the case for replacing Trump.

Pennsylvania, which Trump narrowly won in 2016, would be a crucial state to win in the next presidential election; Trump apparently has seen his pro-industry policies as a path toward winning it, and his reelection, once again.

The president railed against a ban on fracking – which had the support of many Democrats seeking to unseat him in 2020 – arguing that the controversial method of extracting natural gas brought wealth to rural and downtrodden areas and will create a boom in construction jobs throughout the state.

""My job is to represent to people of Pittsburgh, not the people of Paris,"" Trump said, resurfacing a line he used previously.

The politics surrounding the oil and gas industry in Pennsylvania, however, has not been as clean as Trump said the pipelines will be.

In the suburbs that might be key to his path to victory, Pennsylvania voters have shown a growing opposition to the drilling and massive pipelines required to move its product across the state. Candidates in state and local races increasingly have been hardening their stances on the industry. National polling showed growing skepticism of fracking, the process used in extraction.

While the issue is unlikely to have a game-changing effect on the race already dominated by Trump's strong personality, a looming impeachment fight and accusations of racism, Trump's eagerness to promote the industry underscored his tight focus on shoring up his base of rural voters, even at the risk of alienating others.

""Today, I'm proud to declare that I've delivered on every single promise I made to this conference three years ago and much, much more,"" Trump said.

Several Democrats seeking the White House have taken their own political risks on the issue. Backed by environmentalists on the left, soe candidates— including Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren — have broken from the party's past support for fracking to call for a nationwide ban. More centrist candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden, have declined to go that far.

Biden, who also was in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, openly criticized Trump, saying the policies he espoused hurt those very same blue-collar workers the president was courting later in the day.

Biden cast the wealthy president as a charlatan populist whose tax policies, economic stewardship and overall erratic leadership style has hurt U.S. workers.

""This administration has no idea what hard-working, decent, ordinary Americans are going through,"" Biden said during a speech in his hometown of Scranton.

Biden has argued that he could reassemble Obama's winning coalition by winning back some working-class white voters who sided with Trump while reversing Democrats' decline from 2012 among nonwhite voters in cities such as Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee.

On the roster: Support for impeachment reaches new high - Biden booming - How Team Trump made rallies data mining machines - GOP holds narrow edge for Mississippi governor - We can do it!



SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT REACHES NEW HIGH

Quinnipiac University: “Approval among American voters of the U.S. House impeachment inquiry, an inquiry to determine whether or not to bring impeachment charges against President Trump, has reached its highest level, as 55 percent approve of the inquiry, while 43 percent disapprove, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. Last week, 51 percent of voters approved of the inquiry, while 45 percent disapproved. In today's poll, Democrats approve of the inquiry 93 - 7 percent and independent voters approve 58 - 37 percent, while Republicans disapprove of the inquiry 88 - 10 percent. … Nearly half of registered voters, 48 percent, say President Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 46 percent say he should not. Last week, 46 percent supported impeachment while 48 percent were opposed. In today's poll, support for impeachment is 86 - 9 percent among Democrats, and 49 - 41 percent among independents, while Republicans oppose impeachment 91 - 6 percent.”



Trump approval dropping - Quinnipiac University: “President Trump’s job approval rating has dipped below 40 percent for the first time since the impeachment inquiry began as 38 percent say they approve of the job he is doing, and 58 percent disapprove. Last week, 41 percent approved of the president’s job performance, while 54 percent disapproved. This is President Trump’s lowest net approval rating since a July 2018 poll. … Nancy Pelosi gets a mixed approval rating as 45 percent approve of the job she is doing as Speaker of the House, while 47 percent disapprove. Mitch McConnell’s approval rating is deep underwater as 57 percent of voters disapprove of the job he is doing as Senate Majority Leader, while only 24 percent approve.”



Top diplomat’s testimony rattles Congress - NYT: “[During] explosive testimony on Tuesday, William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, laid out in visceral terms the stakes of what he saw as an illegitimate scheme to pressure the Kiev government for political help by suspending American security aid. In by far the most damning account yet to become public in the House impeachment inquiry Mr. Taylor described a president holding up $391 million in assistance for the clear purpose of forcing Ukraine to help incriminate Mr. Trump’s domestic rivals. Mr. Trump’s actions, he testified, undercut American allies desperately fighting off Russia’s attempt to redraw the boundaries of Europe through force.”



Trump defenders storm deposition, shut down probe in protest - WaPo: “A group of House Republicans temporarily shut down the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry on Wednesday, barging into a secure room where a witness was set to testify and refusing to leave despite orders from top Democrats. A group of about two-dozen Trump allies stormed a room in the Capitol basement where three investigative committees were supposed to hear testimony from Laura Cooper, the Pentagon official who oversees Ukraine policy. Those members were not on the committees of jurisdiction and were not supposed to be present during the closed-door deposition. A shouting match began between Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.) and some Democrats in the room as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) left to consult with the sergeant at arms…”



Senate Republicans caution Trump on chaos - WashEx: “Senate Republicans are warning President Trump that he risks bungling impeachment politically and alienating voters, even as he survives a Senate trial, without a focused strategy prosecuted by competent political professionals. With House Democrats expected to approve articles of impeachment by Christmas, Senate Republicans are bracing for the trial, and they are imploring Trump to appreciate the gravity of the situation and prepare. Angry tweets and belligerent news conferences are not sufficient. The president is not in danger of losing anywhere near enough Republican support to be removed from office. But without an effective defense against the Democrats’ charges on the Senate floor, voters might conclude impeachment was justified and oust him in 2020.”



Biden called Clinton impeachment 'lynching' - Fox News: “Even as top Democrats rushed to condemn President Trump's comparison of their impeachment inquiry to a ‘lynching,’ footage and news reports have emerged showing several top Democrats referring matter-of-factly to Bill Clinton's impeachment proceedings as a ‘lynching’ in 1998. Among those Democrats are two African-American representatives still serving in the House, as well as House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and presidential contender Joe Biden. Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., called Clinton's impeachment a ‘persecution’ and a ‘political lynching’ on the House floor in 1998. And Danny Davis, D-Ill., condemned what he described as a ‘lynching in the People's House.’ Biden, who has condemned Trump's remarks as ‘abhorrent’ and ‘despicable,’ said in 1998 that a Clinton impeachment could be perceived as a ‘partisan lynching.’”



THE RULEBOOK: SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS

“The language of Virginia is still more pointed on this subject. Her constitution declares, ‘that the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments shall be separate and distinct; so that neither exercise the powers properly belonging to the other; nor shall any person exercise the powers of more than one of them at the same time, except that the justices of county courts shall be eligible to either House of Assembly.’” – James Madison, Federalist No. 47



TIME OUT: BETTER LATE THAN NEVER

Smithsonian: “Leonardo da Vinci wasn’t known for getting things done. He was often years or even decades late when delivering paintings, and many of the fantastical schemes he concocted… Still, new research conducted by engineers at MIT suggests one of the Renaissance giant’s unbuilt designs—a bridge poised to be the world’s longest—would have worked if the artist had actually followed through on his plans. Leonardo drafted his proposal in response to Sultan Bayezid II’s 1502 appeal for bridge designs. Bayezid, ruler of the Ottoman Empire, wanted to connect the cities of Constantinople and Galata, which were separated by a river estuary called the Golden Horn. … Bayezid was unimpressed by Leonardo’s complicated blueprints, and the bridge the artist envisioned was never built—at least until MIT engineer John Ochsendorf stepped in to test the 500-year-old design’s feasibility. …Ochsendorf and his colleagues analyzed materials available in 1502 and determined the Old Master would probably have used stone rather than wood or brick…”

BIDEN BOOMING

CNN: “Former Vice President Joe Biden's lead in the race for the Democratic nomination for president has rebounded, and now stands at its widest margin since April, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. Biden has the support of 34% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters, his best showing in CNN polling since just after his campaign's formal launch on April 25. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont are about even for second, with 19% and 16%, respectively. Behind them, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris of California each have 6% support, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke each at 3%. … Registered voters generally give Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg large advantages over President Donald Trump in hypothetical general election matchups’ Biden leads the President by 10 points…”



Still rolling in South Carolina - Monmouth University: “Former Vice President Joe Biden remains the clear front-runner among likely Democratic voters in South Carolina. The Monmouth University Poll finds little has changed in overall presidential primary support, but there is evidence that black voters’ preference for the front-runner varies significantly when age and education are taken into account. Biden currently holds 33% support among South Carolina voters who are likely to vote in the February 2020 Democratic primary. … Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (16%) and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (12%) are in the second tier of candidate preferences. … California Sen. Kamala Harris has 6% support… Tom Steyer (4%), South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (3%), New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (2%), Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (2%), and entrepreneur Andrew Yang (2%).”



Video shows Warren waffling on Medicare - Mediaite: “Massachusetts Senator and Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren backed off of Bernie Sanders’ ‘Medicare for All’ plan in leaked video of a private meeting with union officials, saying ‘it’s not that I have a plan that says we’re going to do this part and then we’re going to do this part,’ but that ‘we’re going to get to a table like this.’ Warren has vacillated between being ‘with Bernie’ on his health care plan and considering it a mere ‘framework,’ and most recently told CNN’s David Axelrod that Bernie’s plan is ‘my plan.’ But Mediaite has obtained leaked video from an August 23 meeting with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union executive board in which Warren is considerably more vague about the plan.”



Massachusans like Warren, but not so much her health plan - WBUR: “In the race for her party's presidential nomination, home state U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has opened up a wide lead among likely Democratic primary voters in Massachusetts, according to a new WBUR poll. … But the WBUR poll also has a note of caution for Warren. Medicare for All … is less popular among likely Democratic voters in this blue state than a plan that would include a public option… According to the survey, Warren leads a crowded Democratic field, with 33% of likely voters in the primary supporting her. Former Vice President Joe Biden is second with 18%, Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders is at 13%, and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is in fourth place with 7%. Fifteen percent refused to answer or said they didn't know their answer. While Warren probably benefits from home-field advantage, the poll is the latest in a series of recent surveys that show her moving to front-runner status.



HOW TEAM TRUMP MADE RALLIES DATA MINING MACHINES

WSJ: “The most transformational change has been turning rallies into large-scale data-mining operations. The Trump campaign has collected millions of phone numbers, email addresses and other personal information supporters hand over when signing up for text alerts or registering for rally tickets. The Trump team uses the data to reveal people’s political registrations and in which elections they have voted. Then the team cross-references that information with data on their consumer habits—already collected by the Republican Party—to forecast how likely each rallygoer is to vote in 2020 and which candidate the voter will probably support, campaign officials said. A yet-to-be released smartphone app will offer supporters certain perks, such as accelerated entry into rallies, in exchange for putting the campaign in contact with friends who might back the president and hand over personal data.”



Dem PAC spends big bashing Trump in key general election states - Axios: “A major outside Democratic group is outspending President Trump on Facebook ads in the crucial battleground states of Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Why it matters: 2020 presidential candidates have spent at least $61 million so far this cycle on Facebook and Google ads, with Trump in the lead, according to the Wesleyan Media Project. But that's national spending. The state-by-state spend (below) is important because that's where the 2020 election will be won. … Meanwhile, Priorities USA — a major Democratic super PAC — launched a digital ad campaign in late July ‘focused on holding President Trump accountable’ and highlighting how his economic policies have negatively affected some Americans. The group spent $40 million online in 2016 and they said they plan to spend more than that in 2020.”



Dick’s CEO tries on the idea of a presidential run - Politico: “Ed Stack, the CEO of Dick’s Sporting Goods and a longtime Republican donor, is testing the waters for a possible third-party presidential bid that could scramble the dynamics of the 2020 general election. Various messages were presented to a focus group in southern Wisconsin this week centering on the billionaire businessman, along with possible three-way match-ups against Donald Trump and Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren. The focus group, according to a source who took part in the testing, ran through varying themes involving Stack and heavily focused on his example of ‘showing leadership’ by halting the sale of assault-style rifles at all of Dick’s Sporting Goods stores in the wake of the high school massacre in Parkland, Florida.”



GOP HOLDS NARROW EDGE FOR MISSISSIPPI GOVERNOR

Mississippi Clarion Ledger: “A new poll shows the Mississippi gubernatorial race remains tight with less than two weeks to Election Day. It also found a majority of voters oppose impeaching and removing President Donald Trump from office. … Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves leading Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood 46% to 43%. 2% support third-party candidates Bob Hickingbottom or Dave Singletary … Other recent polls have shown a similarly competitive race, closer than any state governor contest since 2003. Republicans have controlled the governor's mansion since 2004. Mason-Dixon pollsters indicated Trump's scheduled Nov. 1 rally in Tupelo ‘could be a deciding factor’ and offer a ‘significant boost’ for Reeves with GOP turnout. They noted Trump's last-minute campaigning in Louisiana recently helped force incumbent Democrat John Bel Edwards into a runoff.”

“As American people, we do a lot of business in China. And they know and understand our values and we understand their values. And one of our best values in America is free speech.

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I’m at the point where I may hibernate this winter and avoid at all costs any media news. There are so many things I find biased, crooked and overblown, most of all the vendetta against the president. I resent the focus on this as opposed to a new trade policy, immigration reform, poor reports on education in the US, drugs and so many urgent items. Trump wasn’t my first choice for president in 2016, but I supported him when nominated. I don’t care nearly as much about his horrible personality as I do about his policies and the things he’s accomplished. … The polls say ‘Impeach! Elect Socialists! Elect people who are not only corrupt but suffering from delusions or dementia.’ I’m old, cranky and tired of the idiocy. Boo hiss.” – Susan Williams, St. Louis

“Something that is not talked about is, if college tuition became free in the United States is it reasonable for a college student to believe they can choose their college and/or major? One of the casualties of big socialized governments is there is no mechanism to afford personal individuality, uniqueness or desire. Everyone is treated the same. It then seems a reasonable conclusion that all students who want free college tuition to be tested, the government decide what the student demonstrates high aptitude in and the government choses the school and/or major for that student. This would be based on how the government decides the student can best serve the masses, not the individual student’s desires. In the United States we generally believe in mutually beneficial transactions. Meaning, both parties to a transaction receive something. One party receives the quantity and quality of a good or service, the other receives money. Both parties win. It would be a sea change to believe the student would receive both; free education and the choice of where to go and what to major in.” – Jim Hain, Omaha, Neb.



[Ed. note: Well, we do already kind of dabble in that. The federal government provides special incentives for students to choose certain disciplines and for institutions to choose certain types of students – directing research funds to preferred research, creating incentives for encouraging women into STEM, etc. But I take your larger point. If a four-year college degree becomes like high school is now, i.e. a guaranteed good available to all residents, one imagines that the government will take a similarly strong interest in what colleges teach and what students will earn. We have already seen it through the pressures applied to schools via Pell Grants and other forms of funding. But leaving aside the consideration of funding, which is a lulu, the main concern about universal college is that it will diminish the value of college for those who do attend. One of the reasons college has been such a great ladder into the middle class is that it isn’t for everyone. About a third of Americans over 25 have at least a four-year degree. But for Americans over 65, it’s only about a quarter of the population. It stands to reason that new graduates holding college degrees 40 years ago were more valuable than those today. What happens if we see college-going rates soar to 60 percent or more? There are lots of good things about higher education (and plenty of bad things, too). But many of the good things are not about what happens in the classroom – socialization, training in independent living in a controlled atmosphere, a sense of cultural belonging. Those things may or may not be degraded in a world of universal college. But the value of a degree, and thereby its utility for upward socioeconomic mobility, certainly would.]

Bloomberg: “America is sitting on a mountain of uneaten bacon. More than 40 million pounds (18,000 metric tons) of pork bellies, the cut used for bacon making, were sitting in refrigerated warehouses as of Sept. 30, according to U.S. government data released Tuesday. That’s the most for the month since 1971. The overhang came after a buildup in the American hog herd. Pork output surged over the summer months and through September, said Dennis Smith, senior account executive at Archer Financial Services Inc. Bellies have seen a magnified inventory increase because demand is mostly domestic, unlike cuts such as ham, for which overseas buying can help reduce reserves.”

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in 2020, former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus argued on Tuesday.

During an exclusive interview with Fox News, the longtime political strategist argued that Warren was too caught up in policy, not relatable enough, and so extreme that she would drive voters to support Trump.

""Without question,"" he would choose Warren as Trump's opponent. ""It's just this outlandish worldview that Elizabeth Warren has that will drive people that may not be thrilled with everything that President Trump is doing -- but under the circumstances of being given a choice between Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren, they're going to go with Donald Trump.""

""It's incredible how badly the Democratic party is screwing this up for themselves. It's amazing. They've got one left-wing nut after the next on television,"" he told Fox News.

WATCH: ELIZABETH WARREN DODGES QUESTION ON HOW SHE WOULD FUND 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

His comments came just days before he's set to sit down at Politicon with Fox News contributor Donna Brazile who, like Priebus, served as chair of her respective party during the 2016 presidential election. He will expand on the atmosphere surrounding 2020 and talk about the direction of the country. Priebus will also participate in a panel on Republicans’ electoral prospects following Trump’s first term at Politicon.

Voters in the U.S., Priebus told Fox, mostly weren't concerned with policies like reparations or ""Medicare for all."" Instead, they focused on issues like manufacturing and jobs. Priebus argued that voters would have a harder time deciding between Trump and candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, or Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was a ""close second"" behind Warren for Priebus' chosen nominee. “He’s a little Trumpy … I think his rhetoric flows well, better than Elizabeth Warren, with blue-collar workers in the midwest -- kind of his middle finger type philosophy to just a lot of things that folks claim is unfair,"" he said of Sanders.

According to Priebus, Trump and Republicans were ""brilliant"" to focus on the Democrats' more progressive elements like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and her ""squad"" of progressive freshmen. “There’s nothing more you want to do than give people a stark contrast in the ballot box -- so when people go to vote, they want to see night and day as far as a choice,"" he said.

He added that ""extreme"" Democratic policies in Washington, D.C., were making it more likely that reluctant Trump donors would pull out their checkbook and support his re-election.

But none of the party's frontrunners, he argued, were able to appeal to both a progressive base and midwestern voters. And although Biden was the more likable Democrat, he wasn't credible on left-wing policies, Priebus said.

""So, they have nothing. They don’t have a complete candidate who can do both which is why you’re seeing people like [Michael] Bloomberg dipping his toe in, you saw the poll last week about Michelle Obama -- that she would be the frontrunner. The Democrats are desperate,"" he said.

Biden's prospects, Priebus added, were much worse than Trump's were during the 2016 primaries. He argued that Trump ""was never really behind"" and, as a consequence, Republican National Committee delegates didn't have anywhere to go other than supporting Trump.

Biden, on the other hand, could face a brokered convention where he may need to shore up progressives due to the nature of Democratic politics. Democrats, he said, had “real tight race among three or four people and they also shell out most of their delegates on a proportional basis at their conventions … and in their primary battles.”

Priebus also put the kibosh on any chance that former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton could enter the race and win in 2020. ""I think she's pretty much-damaged goods at this point,"" he said. He argued that Warren faced the same flaw that Clinton did in 2016: neither were ""likable.""

Trump, he added, delivered on his promise to ""blow things up"" in Washington and was immune to the controversies that would doom any other politician. “He’s judged by the American people on a different standard. He’s immune from all of these controversies.""

On impeachment, Priebus argued that the president should continue playing ""the victim card"" and attacking the way Democrats handled it -- something he described as a ""sham."" Impeachment, he predicted, could turn out to be a boon for Trump, especially since the Ukraine controversy implicated Biden."

The Broncos traded Sanders and a fifth-round pick to the San Francisco 49ers for a third- and a fourth-round pick, according to KUSA-TV. The 49ers later confirmed the trade.

“I think eventually with what happened after the Tennessee game [a 16-0 victory] and where we were and with the value we were getting for him, we decided it was the best thing for our team to trade Emmanuel,” Elway said at a news conference without clarifying.

Sanders had one catch on three targets for zero yards. He left in the second half with a knee injury. Two weeks before the Titans game, he had five catches for 104 yards in a two-point loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Elway said that it was Sanders who requested the trade.

“When we looked at it, Emmanuel had issues and we had issues,” Elway said. “That is why it was a good time for us to go different directions — for Emmanuel to go in a different direction and for us to go in a different direction. With that being said, we were able to get the value that we thought was fair. That is why we decided to make the deal.”

Sanders was in the middle of his sixth season with the Broncos before the trade. He had 404 receptions for 5,361 yards and 28 touchdowns in 78 games for Denver. He had started 77 of the 78 games.

He told CBS Denver said he was happy with his time in Denver.

After all, the president is also struggling in the polls, battling his own party on Syria, and had to reverse himself on hosting the G-7 at his Florida resort.

But no, the Dems are nervous. So nervous, in fact, that they’re engaged in their quadrennial ritual of fantasizing.

MICK MULVANEY STRUGGLES AS WHITE HOUSE LEAKS SAY HIS JOB IS IN JEOPARDY

What superhero is ready to don a cape, swoop in to rescue them and capture the White House?

The media love such fantasies, of course, because it’s an exciting story line and the chance to pump up a new personality.

Remember when Oprah made a few comments and the press was seized by the idea that she could be president? The only problem was, well, she didn’t want to be president.

Now comes a New York Times report that Democratic donors and insiders are “fretting about who is in the race and longing for a white knight to enter the contest at the last minute.”

The reason, obviously, is a lack of confidence that any of the current field can defeat Donald Trump—who, even after a likely impeachment vote, is virtually certain to survive a trial in the Republican Senate.

The current polls show several Democratic candidates besting Trump, but that could look very different in the fall of 2020 after the nominee is battered by zillions in Republican advertising along with Trumpian attacks.

Joe Biden probably has the best chance to oust Trump, but there is rising concern that his uneven debate performances and anemic fundraising may sink his primary campaign. Biden could have dominated as the target of Trump’s Ukraine efforts, in my view, but he has still not done an interview since impeachment exploded.

Elizabeth Warren is viewed by the prognosticators as having the best shot at the nomination, but there is growing fear that she’s too far left to win a general election. Even as she’s taking a second look at Medicare for All, having ducked questions that it would force a middle-class tax hike, Warren is saddled with other positions that delight Democrats but could be viewed as socialistic in a general election.

If you assume that Bernie Sanders can’t win as a 78-year-old heart attack survivor, that leaves two moderate alternatives to Biden.

Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both had strong debate outings last week, and Mayor Pete has surged into third place in the latest Iowa poll. But neither seems a surefire bet to beat Trump. And thanks to Nancy Pelosi, both are getting far less media oxygen because of the overwhelming focus on impeachment.

So who do the Democratic dreamers want?

The Times says Sherrod Brown is getting a lot of calls (his wife confirms this). But if the Ohio senator thought he could win the nomination, he would already be in the race.

Eric Holder is toying with the idea of getting in. But Barack Obama’s attorney general has never won an election.

Mike Bloomberg? He was a very good New York mayor, but he threatens to run every four years and never does. He wound up deferring to Biden this time. He’s 77. Not happening.

Hillary? You know she’s thought about it. But she also knows she’s had her shot.

(Update: Oops! The Washington Post follows up today, saying: ""Hillary Clinton, according to two people close to her, has not ruled out jumping in herself, a sign that she is hearing similar dissatisfaction."")

Michelle Obama? I’m sure she’d look good in Democratic polls. One unnamed person “mused” about her to the Times. She was a popular first lady. But unlike Hillary, Michelle has never exhibited the urge to be a politician herself. I have the sense that she devoted eight years to public service and is happy to have her life back.

Late entries can kick up a fuss, but they never win, not after the current candidates have raised millions, set up organizations and developed their ground games.

So this is really about a collective unease that Biden won’t win the nomination and that Warren might.

It’s like a fantasy football league, lots of fun to play and game out the possibilities. But this is a contest you only win with flesh-and-blood players on the field."

On Tuesday, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced that the average premium for the Affordable Care Act benchmark plan would drop by 4 percent in 2020, with 20 more insurance plans becoming available on healthcare.gov.

HOUSE GOP RELEASE PLAN IN BID TO FULFILL TRUMP PROMISE AS 'PARTY OF HEALTH CARE'

CMS Administrator Seema Varna also testified on Capitol Hill Wednesday, during a House Energy & Commerce hearing titled: “Sabotage: The Trump administration’s attack on health care,” that in some states, premiums are dropping even more significantly.

In Delaware, premiums dropped 20 percent; in North Dakota premiums dropped 15 percent; and in Oklahoma, dropped 14 percent. Three states, though, -- Indiana, Louisiana, and New Jersey -- will see premiums increase 10 percent or more.

The Trump campaign told Fox News that those figures are a result of action taken by the administration over the last few years to make the Affordable Care Act more competitive, deliver more free-market principles, give consumers more options, and improve the ObamaCare marketplace.

“While Democrats continue to push the narrative that President Trump is trying to ‘sabotage’ their health care, the latest data confirm exactly the opposite,” Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told Fox News.

Democrats on the Energy & Commerce Committee on Wednesday, though, blasted the administration, claiming it was engaging in a ""concerted effort to cut back on people's health insurance, their benefits, and what kind of coverage they have.""

Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., said the administration is actively supporting a lawsuit that would overturn the Affordable Care Act and strip health care coverage from tens of millions of Americans and place ""extremely burdensome and sometimes illegal hurdles"" for Medicaid recipients.

""I am deeply concerned,"" he said.

2020 PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL SAYS WARREN IS LYING ABOUT HEALTH CARE PLAN: 'IT'S A SOUNDBITE'

Earlier this year, the administration told a federal appeals court that the program in its entirety should be abolished. Democrats criticized the administration and Republicans for trying to repeal protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

But the White House has touted a number of improvements under the ACA since Trump took office--including the administration's ability to ""make it easier for small businesses and self-employed workers"" to join and create Association Health Plans; the expansion of short-term, limited-duration plans that typically cost less than other ObamaCare options; the expansion of health reimbursement arrangements; and the elimination of the individual mandate, which forced Americans to buy health insurance, whether they wanted to or not.

This month, Trump signed an executive order that “directed HHS to take a number of specific, significant steps that will meaningfully improve the financing of Medicare, advance the care American seniors receive from their doctors, and improve the health they enjoy.""

But even as the Trump re-election campaign and Trump administration takes credit for the Affordable Care Act’s current stability, officials and Republican lawmakers are still pursuing Trump’s 2016 campaign promise of trying to do away with the program altogether.

This week, the Republican Study Committee released a health care plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, two years after the GOP was unable to agree on a health care plan to scrap ObamaCare during the first year of Trump’s administration.

The new 66-page framework also represents an effort to compete with 2020 Democrats pushing health care plans like ""Medicare-for-all."" The new plan looks to “transform the individual marketplace’s current regulatory structure, unwind the ACA’s Washington-centric approach and largely return regulatory authority to individual states.”

""Until Congress gets around to replacing it, the president will do what he can to fix the problems created by this system for millions of Americans,"" HHS Secretary Alexander Azar said. ""The president who was supposedly trying to sabotage this law has been better at running it than the guy who wrote it.""

As for 2020, Democratic presidential hopefuls like Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have blasted Trump for his handling of the health care system, and are peddling a sweeping ""Medicare-for-all"" policy.

Candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden have instead touted ObamaCare, and proposed building on the Obama-era health care overhaul, while criticizing Trump for his moves to eliminate it.

“Before Donald Trump even stepped foot into the Oval Office, he pledged to strip millions of Americans of their health care,"" Biden said in a statement released by his campaign earlier this month. “As Donald Trump continues attempting to tear down the Affordable Care Act, I will fight him every step of the way.”

Meanwhile, with regard to the lawsuit, a federal appeals court in New Orleans could deliver its ruling on the case during the sign-up season--spanning from Nov. 1 in most states through Dec. 15.

Azar said that he was not concerned, even if the judges rule to throw out the entire health care program.

""Our messaging would be to keep calm and carry on,"" he said, noting that the case is expected to go to the Supreme Court. ""There will be no immediate disruption to anyone.""

TOMI LAHREN ISN'T SHOCKED BY 'SQUAD'S ENDORSEMENT

""Well, the Democrats got their way,"" said Lahren.

""He said he would be willing to do it at no profit or, if possible, at zero cost to the American taxpayer...but of course, the Democrats and closeted Never Trump RINO's raised a stink and got their way,"" she added.

Last Saturday, Trump announced that his administration will no longer consider his personal resort in Doral, Fla., to host the 2020 G7 summit, and suggested he might consider the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland instead.

""Based on both Media & Democrat Crazed and Irrational Hostility, we will no longer consider Trump National Doral, Miami, as the Host Site for the G-7 in 2020,"" the president tweeted. ""We will begin the search for another site, including the possibility of Camp David, immediately. Thank you!""

The announcement followed earlier tweets in which he said he thought he ""was doing something very good for our Country"" by hosting world leaders at his Florida resort next year.

TOMI LAHREN WARNS YOUNG AMERICANS TO VOTE AGAINST SOCIALISM

“It is big, grand, on hundreds of acres, next to MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, has tremendous ballrooms & meeting rooms, and each delegation would have its own 50 to 70 unit building,"" he tweeted.

The president followed up by saying he had offered to host the summit at no profit to himself to avoid concerns about “emoluments violations.” He said if it were legally permissible, he’d offer to host the summit at no cost to the U.S.

Democratic lawmakers said Friday that past G7 summits have cost ""upwards of $40 million.""

“But, as usual, the Hostile Media & their Democrat Partners went CRAZY!” Trump wrote.

Agreeing with the president, Lahren slammed the Democrats for their ""freak out"" against the initial announcement, but applauded the president for ""folding on this particular battle.""

""Look, the Democrats with their raging Trump Derangement Syndrome are going to freak out and lash out at this president on a minute-by-minute basis regardless, but it was probably wise of President Trump to fold on this particular battle,"" said Lahren.

Lahren took aim at the Democrats' fear that the president would profit off the summit, and explained the sacrifice he and his family have made in his current role.

""To assert President Trump and his family have made money off his presidency is ridiculous,"" said Lahren. ""If anything, they’ve lost money, lost business deals, lost much of the brand presence they had before Donald Trump won the election and forever embittered the crybaby Left,"" she continued.

""And don’t forget the damage the Trump brand has suffered all because he won the election--boycotts, removals, vandalism and more,"" Lahren added.

Doubling down in her criticism, Lahren discussed Trump's background as a business mogul, and accused the Democrats of being ""jealous and bitter of his net worth.""

""In case no one was aware of this prior to the 2016 election victory, Donald Trump is and always has been a businessman. Do the Democrats really expect him to give up all of his assets, earnings and worldly possession simply because they are jealous of his net worth and bitter over his election victory?

""Furthermore, let’s not forget that President Trump donates his presidential salary,"" Lahren continued. ""Heck, socialist cheerleaders, Bernie Sanders and [Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] won’t do it. They won’t put their money where their mouths are.""

""At the end of the day,"" Lahren added, ""winning is what this all stems from. The daily smearing of our president and everything he does for this nation is all because the Democrats and Never Trump RINOs lost.

""They hate him because they ain’t him,"" she concluded.

COULD SENATE REFUSE TO HONOR HOUSE DEMOCRAT-LED 'IRREGULAR' IMPEACHMENT?

On Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive"" Wednesday, Burns said that the ""elephant in the room"" is that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., opted not to ask the full House of Representatives to vote on the question of opening a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump. Instead, Pelosi announced that an impeachment inquiry had begun, breaking precedent regarding these proceedings.

""You don't have to be a rocket scientist or an MIT professor to know that they didn't do a vote because they didn't want to have [Democratic House members] stand up in districts that were against it and have to vote for it,"" said Burns, adding that some moderate Democrats are hesitant to declare their support for impeachment.

He predicted that Democrats will eventually abandon their impeachment push.

""I think they're going to come out and [say]... 'We do not want to put the American public through this type of debacle. However, of course, it's fully warranted,'"" Burns said.

""There's always a rhetorical flourish for everything, which achieves your goals semantically and rhetorically,"" he added.

Wall Street Journal editorial board member William McGurn said he is skeptical of Burns' theory.

""I don't see how... Mrs. Pelosi, once she's taken this step, I don't see how you can do it and I think if you don't impeach the president, it looks like another Mueller report,"" argued McGurn. ""All these promises, 'We're gonna get him. We finally got him on the ropes and we don't do it.' I find it hard to believe the House won't impeach.""

Tom Del Beccaro, former chairman of the California Republican Party, conceded that Pelosi and her fellow Democrats have taken a huge political risk by pursuing impeachment.

""On November 1st [2018] in the Washington Examiner, I predicted that the Democrats would turn to impeachment if they got the House, because having the House isn't enough. You can pass a bill, but if it's not signed, their base was never going to be pleased,"" Del Beccaro said. ""I said they would go to impeachment regardless of the facts. So here we are and what [Burns is] saying is the facts truly don't justify this.""

However, Del Beccaro agreed with McGurn that Democrats will suffer politically if they don't follow through on their threats to impeach.

""The political point is that they have promised their base time and again and their base continues to move left -- [Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] going to Bernie Sanders -- all of this, can they simply lose face again in an election year? This is some of the biggest roll of the dice that I have ever seen.""

McGurn said: ""I also think it's a risk more broadly for Democrats. I sort of think [former president] Bill Clinton came out stronger because the impeachment failed in the Senate. I don't think that was clear at the time... if [Trump's] impeached and not convicted, I think it will look like another Muller report.""

Del Beccaro concluded: ""I think historians 50 years from now will look back on this as a misguided attempt.""

LEGAL EXPERT: PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SUCCESS WILL COUNT AGAINST HIM IN LAWSUIT AGAINST CNN

Former Obama State Department official and adviser to the Obama campaign David Tafuri said that Democrats will go through with impeachment, though it may take them longer than expected.

""I expect the Democrats will deliberate longer than we expect,"" Tafuri said. ""It's going to take longer for them to get there. I think they'll vote in favor of impeachment. Articles will go to a trial in the Senate. It can be hard for him to be removed because 20 Republican senators would have to switch... [but] you never know when you get to a jury what's going to happen. That's the mystery of a court process like this. When it goes to the jury, the jury gets to decide.""

WHAT WILL WE MAKE OF OUR MOMENT?

Periods of political upheaval can be wonderful things. Needed changes once deemed politically impossible suddenly become realities. Old superstitions and their totems can finally be discarded.



But it’s never all good.



The tumult of the first half of the 1970s is instructive. After that period, which included the resignations of the vice president and then president over corruption and abuses of power, Washington ushered in much-needed ethics reforms. Congress cracked down on payola for members and mandated financial disclosure for itself and the other two branches.



But that same era resulted in the birth of the modern political primary system that wreaks increasing damage on the republic cycle after cycle. Getting rid of smoke-filled rooms may have decreased the power of party bosses, but has introduced more demagoguery – both fanatical and fantastical – to our public life.



Like last-call shots of Fireball, microwave burritos and men in skinny jeans, it sounded like a good idea at the time.



As the parties clash this time in Washington, we don’t know what the era to come will bring. Which will be the positive changes to laws and attitudes born from this era of political chaos unseen four decades? Which will be ones that linger like a Fireball hangover?



With this in mind, consider the offering from today’s WaPo: “The Constitution isn’t the cure for President Trump. It is the cause.” by Shira Lurie, a history professor at the University of Toronto who formerly taught at the University of Virginia.



We encourage you to read her piece to get a fuller understanding of the argument, but her basic effort is to caution those involved in the struggle to either oust or constrain President Trump by constitutional means are simultaneously deepening our esteem for our flawed founding charter.



“Democrats can and should seek a constitutional remedy to remove Trump,” she writes. “But we need to confront the idea that a president who lost the popular vote by millions, deceives the public, attacks the press and does not have the confidence of the majority of Americans may not be a distortion of the constitutional order, but a feature.”



We wondered whether to even call attention to the piece lest we be guilty of that version of straw man argument that The Dispatch’s David French has delightfully dubbed “nut picking.” That’s when you find a fringe character from an opposing point of view and drag them forward to suggest that some far-flung idea is really mainstream.



Lurie is not in the political mainstream. In fact, she acknowledges it by expressing concern that Democrats are expressing excessive reverence for the Constitution.



“Worshiping the Constitution as a sacred text is not patriotism, it’s fanaticism,” she warns. “We can continue to pray to it, but it won’t save us. It is high time to address the anti-democratic foundations of American government.”



But we fear that the bipartisan reverence for our founding is actually pretty surficial these days. Leaders in both parties are closer to Lurie than she knows.



When the executive branch shows absolute contempt for the clearly stated powers of the legislative branch in a letter that sounds like it was dictated by Huey Long from a balcony you don’t get that good ol’ separation-of-powers tingle.



When Democratic presidential candidates willy-nilly offer proposals that ignore not only those same separations but doing so using the kind of cheap demagoguery that defies the principles of both the Constitution and the Declaration, one doesn’t feel the gentle breezes of a return to Madisonian democracy.



Our era will produce substantial change for the generations to come. Whatever shape that takes, we would do better to avoid the mistakes of the past and use our era to strengthen, not diminish, the Constitution that has seen us through this and all of our previous crises.

TIME OUT: DEMOCRATIC DUNGAREES

Atlantic: “If you want to sell clothes in America, it helps a lot if buyers think your product is cool. Jeans have a backstory that any marketer would kill for. ‘Denim first became popular in the 1920s and 1930s in tandem with the rise of Hollywood,’ explains Emma McClendon, an associate curator at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, who orchestrated a denim retrospective at the museum in 2015. … Over the years, the cuts and washes changed, but denim’s position as a relatively democratic element of the wardrobes of stylish, influential people didn’t. … In the past, only one or two styles of jeans were “cool” at a given time. … Now denim inventory is as infinite as the internet itself. Fast-fashion retailers update their selections constantly, which means that nearly every type of denim is available simultaneously. Depending on whom you ask, the big thing right now might be mom jeans.”

GRAHAM SET TO SQUEEZE FELLOW GOPERS WITH SHOW VOTE

AP: “GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, a top ally of President Donald Trump, is introducing a resolution condemning the Democratic-controlled House for pursuing a ‘closed door, illegitimate impeachment inquiry.’ Graham announced the move Thursday and says the Senate’s top Republican, Mitch McConnell, is a co-sponsor. Graham plans a Thursday afternoon news conference. The nonbinding resolution gives Senate Republicans a chance to show support for Trump at a moment when Trump is urging his GOP allies to get tougher and fight harder for him as the House impeachment probe gathers momentum. Many Senate Republicans are taking a wait-and-see approach amid the House impeachment inquiry. Rather than commenting on the substance of the probe, they are united in complaining that the House is taking depositions from witnesses behind closed doors.”



Some senators are keeping impeachment thoughts to themselves - Politico: “[Susan Collins] is among a group of senators from both parties who are increasingly citing their role as possible jurors in an impeachment trial. They argue that as impartial jurors, they shouldn't make any foregone conclusion — especially about a scandal that could force Trump out of office. … Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee agrees, saying jurors shouldn’t be ‘running around announcing their decision until they’ve heard the arguments.’ … The reserved nature of Republicans like Alexander, who is retiring, and the moderate Collins suggests some in the president's own party are legitimately open to Democrats' arguments — an ominous sign for Trump… It also has the added side benefit of excusing senators from the noisy, day-to-day chaos of the president’s investigation by Congress.”



Dems prepare to go public with probe - WaPo: “House Democrats are preparing to move their largely private impeachment inquiry onto a more public stage as soon as mid-November and are already grappling with how best to present the complex Ukraine saga to the American people. Over the past three weeks, a parade of current and former Trump administration officials have testified behind closed doors, providing House investigators with a compelling narrative of President Trump’s campaign to extract political favors from Ukrainian officials. … Among the witnesses Democrats hope to question in open session are the acting ambassador to Ukraine, William B. Taylor Jr., and his predecessor, former ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. Both are seasoned diplomats who, in earlier House testimony, effectively conveyed outrage over a White House plan to withhold much-needed military aid from Ukraine…”



Wisconsin sees increase in support for impeachment - Marquette University: “A new Marquette Law School poll of Wisconsin registered voters finds that 46 percent think that there is enough cause now for Congress to hold hearings on impeachment of President Donald Trump, while 49 percent say there is not enough cause and 5 percent say they do not know. In April 2019, 29 percent said there was sufficient reason for impeachment hearings and 65 percent said there was not. The April poll was completed after Attorney General William Barr’s letter describing the Mueller report but before the report was publicly released. Earlier, in January 2019, 33 percent supported and 59 percent opposed hearings.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Loyalty to the Constitution - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano questions President Trump’s relationship to upholding the Constitution: “After a weekend of torrential criticism, Trump announced that he had changed his mind and said he would not host the G-7 meeting at the Miami area resort. Yet, in the process of doing so, he characterized the Emoluments Clause as ‘phony.’ Who knows what he meant by phony? The clause is in the Constitution and it means what it says. Yet, whatever Trump meant by phony, it constituted at least a disparagement of the Constitution he has sworn to uphold and at worst a threat to ignore clauses he can disparage. This is most unusual and potentially dangerous, and it raises the question: Can the president lawfully enforce only the clauses of the Constitution with which he agrees and ignore those with which he disagrees? In a word: No.” More here.



Q POLL: WARREN AHEAD, BUT WORRIES ABOUT ELECTABILITY

Quinnipiac University: “Senator Elizabeth Warren has opened up a lead in the Democratic primary race after being locked in a tight race with former Vice President Joe Biden for several weeks, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. Warren receives 28 percent of the vote among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, while Biden gets 21 percent. Sen. Bernie Sanders gets 15 percent, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg gets 10 percent, Sen. Kamala Harris is at 5 percent and Sen. Amy Klobuchar is at 3 percent. No other candidate tops one percent. … Biden is still viewed as the candidate who has the best chance of winning against Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election… In today's poll, Biden gets 42 percent, but this is down from 48 percent in the October 14 poll… Warren comes in second on this electability question with 20 percent, followed by Sanders at 14 percent.”



Biden really slipping in fundraising pack - Politico: “Joe Biden’s campaign is drawing more support from big-ticket donors than any other candidate in the race — yet he still can’t match his rivals’ cash flow. Biden has raised $20.7 million from contributions of at least $500 — $1.5 million more than his nearest competitor, despite entering the race later than all of them — thanks to the former vice president’s strong connections and goodwill among the traditional donors who have long financed the Democratic Party. … But it’s been nowhere near enough to make Biden the leader of the fundraising pack. In fact, his big-dollar dominance, and his reliance on those donors, is more evidence of how quickly small-dollar donations have become the most important component of political fundraising in a sprawling, fractured Democratic race. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg are all outraising Biden, and stockpiling cash significantly faster than him, on the back of major support from online donors that Biden has been unable to build.”



Tim Ryan bows out - NBC News: “Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, ended his long-shot presidential campaign after months of struggling to find a footing in the crowded Democratic field. Ryan announced his decision to end his campaign in a video to supporters, stating he would run again for his House seat. He isn’t throwing his support behind anyone in the 2020 field at this time, his campaign told NBC. ‘I got into this race in April to really give voice to the forgotten people of our country: the workers who have been left behind, the businesses who have been left behind, the people who need health care or aren’t getting a quality education, or are saddled by tremendous debt,’ Ryan said. 'I'm proud of this campaign because I believe we’ve done that. We’ve given voice to the forgotten communities and the forgotten people in the United States.'""



Moderators announced for November debate - NBC News: “The fifth Democratic presidential primary debate in Georgia will have four moderators, MSNBC announced on Wednesday — and all of them are women. Moderating the Nov. 20 event, which is being co-hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post, will be Rachel Maddow, host of ‘The Rachel Maddow Show’ on MSNBC; Andrea Mitchell, host of ‘Andrea Mitchell Reports’ on MSNBC and NBC News' chief foreign affairs correspondent; Kristen Welker, NBC News' White House correspondent; and Ashley Parker, a White House reporter for The Washington Post. The debate will likely feature a smaller lineup of candidates than the dozen who qualified for October's debate in Ohio — only eight candidates have qualified for the debate stage so far, according to an unofficial NBC News tally. It will also be shorter than the three-hour October debate — it's scheduled to air from 9 to 11 p.m. ET.”



BORIS JOHNSON LAUNCHES BID FOR DECEMBER ELECTION

Fox News: “Boris Johnson will launch an attempt to hold a general election in Britain on December 12 to ‘get Brexit done.’ The British prime minister will attempt to convince members of Parliament to formally back the bid on Monday, but he will need the support of two-thirds of the House of Commons. Britain's next scheduled election is not until 2022. Johnson's move comes after his Brexit bill was finally passed earlier this week, but lawmakers defeated his request to push through the legislation in a three-day timetable, saying it didn't provide enough time for scrutiny. He said he expected the European Union to grant an extension to his October 31 deadline, likely to be to the end of January. The EU is expected to give its verdict on an extension on Friday. The prime minister said the Dec. 12 date will give lawmakers time before the election to scrutinize his Brexit bill. Under his plan, Parliament would remain working until Nov. 6, when campaigning would start.”

AUDIBLE: AMEN

“Back in 2015, his city roiled by unrest, by day the congressman was here in the Capitol working and leading in these hallways of power. But every night he rode the train back home and walked the neighborhoods, bullhorn in hand, encouraging unity and peace. Here’s what he said: ‘Let’s go home. Let’s all go home.’ Now our distinguished colleague truly has gone home, home to his Father’s house.” – Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in his condolences for Rep. Elijah Cummings as he lies in state at the U.S. Capitol Thursday.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Without asking you to necessarily weigh in on the ‘wisdom’ of same (unless of course you want to), I have two ‘technical’ and hypothetical impeachment questions: If a president is impeached and IS convicted in the Senate, is he/she eligible to run for re-election? (Somewhat similar situation to Marion Barry in Washington, D.C.) If a president is impeached but is NOT convicted in the Senate, could the House vote to re-impeach the president the next day (perhaps even ad infinitum) in a political ground hog day?” – Dave Wittnebert, Seneca, S.C.



[Ed. note: Most certainly, Mr. Wittnebert. President Trump could be removed from office and seek the presidency a second time, and he could be acquitted in the Senate and be re-impeached. But you’d have to think either scenario would be vanishingly rare. We talk often about impeachment being a political, not legal proposition. But that applies to its aftermath, too. If Trump becomes such a boat anchor that Senate Republicans feel obliged to cut ties with him, it will be because he is too great a political liability/embarrassment. If he is let off by the Senate, House Democrats will move urgently to pivot away from what will almost certainly be a somewhat embarrassing anti-climax.]



“I'm doing a bit of head scratching over what I see as competing information. By this I mean that I'm seeing President Trump's approval rating on a swift downhill slide and at the same time I'm hearing that the Democrats are hand-wringing over whether they have a candidate that can defeat him in 2020. Who needs to be more concerned?” – Neil Klapthor, Evans, Ga.



[Ed. note: The one who’s trailing a year from today! I kid, I kid… mostly. The past three weeks have been brutal for Trump, partly because of Democrats’ closing ranks and prosecuting their impeachment with vigorous determination. But it’s mostly been self-inflicted. Will the trend continue? Almost certainly not. It may get worse for the incumbent over time if further revelations drive a wedge between Trump and the GOP or it may get worse for Democrats because their own penchant for infighting will re-emerge. I suspect it will probably be quite a bit of both. But there are other considerations, particularly the health of the economy in the first two quarters of 2020. Given how much farther this river runs, it’s probably best to sail with the current for now and enjoy the view. We won’t find out who’s going over Niagara for a while yet.]

A PUMPKIN SPICE FLOAT

WTVC: “Around this time of year, most people take to carving pumpkins. But a farmer in Cleveland, Tennessee took things one step further. Justin Ownby grew a massive pumpkin that weighed 910 pounds… But he was not satisfied merely by its ornamental delights that enhance the season. Ownby's wife Christin Ownby shared video with WTVC that shows Ownby hollowed out the pumpkin, and converted to a buoyant watercraft that he tested on his farm's pond. A second video has someone off camera asking him to do his impression of ‘Washington crossing the Delaware!,’ and Ownby stands up as the pumpkin submerges under the sudden weight. Ownby says Justin used a seed to grow the pumpkin that came from a record-breaking pumpkin grown in Tennessee that weighed more than 1,700 pounds. … Christin Ownby says the pumpkin remains floating in the pond at last check, saying ‘It will make a great snack for the catfish!’”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“When I was growing up, I thought ‘gyp’ was simply a synonym for ‘cheat,’ and used it accordingly. It was only when I was an adult that I learned that gyp was short for gypsy. At which point, I stopped using it. … Why? Simple decency. … It’s a question not of who or how many had their feelings hurt, but of whether you want to associate yourself with a word that, for whatever historical reason having nothing to do with you, carries inherently derogatory connotations.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Oct. 17, 2013.

Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said the 48-hour power outage was to affect nearly 180,000 homes and businesses in portions of 17 counties in the Sierra foothills and north of the San Francisco Bay Area.

The Santa Rosa Fire Department tweeted that shutoffs had started in the city and it was getting multiple reports of outages.

""Public Safety Power Shutoffs have begun in Santa Rosa. We have multiple reports of outages from the Rincon Valley and Oakmont Areas,"" the department wrote.

The utility previously cut off power from Oct. 9-12 to more than 2 million people across the Bay Area to prevent high winds from toppling lines that could then spark deadly wildfires like one that did massive amounts of damage last year.

PG&E BEGINS 2ND WAVE OF CALIFORNIA PLANNED POWER OUTAGES TO HEAD OFF WILDFIRE RISK

The new rolling blackouts have elicited frustration from residents and business owners and have spurred purchases of batteries, generators and other emergency supplies.

""Working this close to the last outage is going to be a true trial by fire,"" said Garrett Sanders, owner of Love Birds Coffee & Tea in the old Gold Rush town of Placerville.

Sanders said he lost around $6,000 in the last outage. He said he planned to brew coffee and stock up on pastries for a sidewalk sale.

He sympathized with the argument that the outages are designed to prevent more devastating wildfires. Some Placerville residents relocated from Paradise, a town leveled by last year's fast-moving Camp Fire.

Not everyone is as understanding, however. Angry customers took things further in the earlier power outage, with a PG&E office in Oroville vandalized with eggs.

Authorities were also investigating an attack in which a PG&E utility truck was shot in Colusa County, and the wife of one utility worked pleaded with the public to not lash out at workers.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a letter to Bill Johnson, PG&E's CEO, the utility has failed to upgrade and maintain its equipment, resulting in the massive blackouts and the inconvenience to customers.

""I believe the unacceptable scope and duration of the previous outage — deliberately forcing 735,000 customers to endure power outages — was the direct result of decades of PG&E prioritizing profit over public safety,"" Newsom wrote

PG&E has denied the blackouts are about saving money in the wake of a string of lawsuits over its role in last year's fires.

While speaking with Fox News, Priebus defended Spicer and pushed back on his critics.

""I think good for him. I think it's fun and for all those people that love to poke fun at Sean ... well, what have they ever done?""

He added that liberals would have to continue seeing Spicer on television whether they liked it or not.

""They're going to have Spicer for weeks on end.""

Priebus and Spicer both worked to get Trump elected in 2016 as they worked alongside each other in the Republican National Committee. Priebus, the party's former chair, indicated that he wouldn't follow his colleague's path to stardom.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., took a shot at South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg for suggesting that he would nominate independent-minded judges like former Justice Anthony Kennedy to the Supreme Court.

Buttigieg has been outspoken about his stance on expanding the Supreme Court in hopes of making it less partisan, but in an interview with Cosmopolitan, he shed some light as to the type of nominee he'd appoint as president.

""My appointments will definitely be people who share my values. But when I’m talking about the structure of the Supreme Court, I’m talking about something deeper,"" Buttigieg said. ""I’m talking about depoliticizing the Supreme Court Because right now, every time there’s a vacancy, there’s this apocalyptic ideological battle and it hurts the court and it hurts the country.""

Buttigieg went on to explain that he wanted justices ""who think for themselves"" and cited Kennedy and former Justice David Souter as examples.

""So I've floated several ideas and deliberately kept some level of open-mindedness about which ones are going to work best. One of them would be to have 15 members, but 5 of them can only be seated if the other 10 unanimously agree,"" Buttigieg continued. ""The idea here is you get more justices who think for themselves. Justices like Justice Kennedy or Justice Souter, and there are many legal scholars who think this could be done without a constitutional amendment under current law.""

The South Bend mayor faced backlash from the progressive left on social media with critics pointing to Kennedy's record on the Supreme Court -- including his votes with the majority on the landmark 2010 Citizens United campaign-finance case and in the ruling upholding the White House's travel restrictions affecting multiple Muslim-majority countries last year.

Sanders, the first 2020 candidate to weigh in on Buttigieg's remarks, was a bit more subtle with his criticism.

""Interesting, I’d like more justices like Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor,"" Sanders tweeted.

JUSTIN HASKINS: ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ PROVES AGAIN SHE HAS NO IDEA WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT

Yet the tragedy of our time is that these Democrats are being betrayed by their own party, by imposters who pretend to be Democrats but are not.

The truth is, freedom-loving Democrats and Republicans stand together against a third group that has infiltrated our national political parties – extreme leftists who openly reject the ideals expressed by the American founders.

Whether they call themselves democratic socialists or “woke” advocates for social justice, these authoritarian leftists have little in common with past leaders of the Democratic Party – people such as Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, along with governors like Ann Richards of Texas.

While Jimmy Carter said “the love of liberty is a common blood that flows in our American veins,” the new authoritarian leftists seek to do everything they can to restrict freedom, not expand it.

For Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a self-described democratic socialist who spent his honeymoon touring the Soviet Union, that means making private health insurance illegal and creating a “national wealth registry” to aid government confiscation of “excessive” wealth.

Of course, many, if not most, real Democrats are horrified by these leftist assaults on long-established American liberties.

For former Rep. Robert “Beto” O’Rourke, D-Texas, it means that all churches, synagogues, mosques and religious organizations that do not publicly accept gay marriage shall lose their tax-exempt status and not be allowed to participate in public life.

“There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone, or any institution, any organization in America that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us,” O’Rourke said at a CNN town hall Oct. 10.

For New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, it means passing a law making it a crime to use the words “illegal alien” in a way that can be construed as “demeaning,” punishable by a fine of up to $250,000.

Indeed, the new authoritarians seem to go out of their way to attack the Bill of Rights, especially freedom of speech, freedom of religion and the right to bear arms.

“I would love to regulate free speech,” Rep Ted Lieu, D-Calif., announced in a jaw-dropping admission on live TV a year ago. “The First Amendment prevents me from doing so.”

Realizing what he had just admitted to, Lieu quickly added that it’s probably better if government not regulate speech but, instead, “outsource” such censorship to big tech monopolies such as YouTube and Facebook. “I would urge these private sector companies to regulate it better themselves,” he said.

In the past, Democrats sought to use the power of the state to check the worst excesses of the free market, to provide a safety net for people in time of need, while simultaneously protecting the fundamental rights and responsibilities outlined in the U.S. Constitution.

In contrast, the imposters now taking over the Democratic Party want to abolish parts of the U.S. Constitution and replace them with something else — an alien ideology that gladly sacrifices basic civil liberties in the pursuit of allegedly higher ideals.

""Leftists are more likely than liberals to argue that economic inequality renders America’s constitutional liberties hollow,"" Peter Beinart wrote in The Atlantic. ""They’re more likely to look abroad — to the Soviet Union or Cuba in past eras, and to Scandinavia today — for alternatives to America’s political and economic models.""

Of course, many, if not most, real Democrats are horrified by these leftist assaults on long-established American liberties.

They are quick to say they are fighting for better wages and affordable health care, not a “Green New Deal” that could cost as much as $93 trillion.

Yet, if they are not careful, their party will soon be led not by pro-union Democrats such as former Vice President Joe Biden or Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, but by extreme leftist ideologues who care more about punishing churches for thought crimes than they do about creating jobs and better schools.

Charlie Chaplin, the iconic actor and at the time a well-known political leftist (some said communist), delivered a speech in San Francisco in 1941 prior to America’s entry into World War II.

As recounted in the biography of her parents – actress Fay Wray and screenwriter Robert Riskin – Victoria Riskin quotes from a letter her father, who heard the speech, sent to her mother: “(Chaplin) plunged into a speech extolling the Russians – their ideology (by saying that if communism produces men of such heroic stature, he’ll take communism, etc.). He resented the organized efforts for the last 20 years to present Russians as ogres both here and in England – and by God, if any man can’t get along on $25,000 a year, he is a cockeyed liar and a traitor to his country.”

NEWT GINGRICH: BYE DEMOCRATIC PARTY – YOU'RE BEING TRANSFORMED INTO AN ANTI-AMERICAN ENGINE OF RADICAL CHANGE

At the latest Democratic presidential debate, the millionaire Sanders and hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer had an exchange that came from a question about Sanders saying billionaires should be taxed out of existence to help close the “wealth gap.”

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

Sanders responded by ticking off his familiar litany of misery – half a million people living on the streets (he didn’t mention that many are in cities and states run by Democrats), the cost of education and student debt (he didn’t mention the many options for receiving an education that would substantially reduce student debt), 87 million uninsured, or underinsured (wasn’t ObamaCare supposed to fix that?), adding, “you also have three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society.”

Sanders called that a “moral outrage,” though on his moral scale, abortion on demand is not a problem.

Charging the rich with not paying their “fair share” in taxes is a distraction from the real issue: government spends too much.

For his part, Steyer sought some moral cover for his wealth, agreeing with Sanders and adding that corporations have “bought this government for the last 40 years.” Don’t those four decades include the Clinton and Obama administrations? Steyer said he would undo every tax cut for rich people and wealthy corporations.

We’ve heard it all before. The left would take from the prosperous and do what? Past welfare and redistribution programs haven’t liberated the poor. If they had, there should be fewer poor people. Wasn’t that the stated goal? Why didn’t it happen? The reason is the government is a bad charity.

What astounds is that younger people who buy into the “wealth gap” nonsense (because that is what they have had drummed into them by teachers and Democratic politicians) have little understanding of economics. There is no fixed amount of money from which all must draw. If there were it would be unfair for some to take (earn?) more than others. Wealth is a bottomless well. No one is destined to live permanently in the lower class.

The reason envy, greed and entitlement continue to surface in most election cycles is that it appeals to human emotions. Charging the rich with not paying their “fair share” in taxes is a distraction from the real issue: government spends too much.

Bernie Sanders’ campaign on Thursday accused Joe Biden of selling out to big donors in an effort to “buy the election” following reports that the former vice president and frontrunner for the Democratic Party’s 2020 presidential nomination would form a super PAC to accept unlimited donations from billionaires and corporate elites to cure his current fundraising woes.

A spokesperson for Biden’s campaign responded Thursday evening, telling Fox News in a statement that, in the eyes of President Trump, “the general election has already begun,” and Democrats must use any means possible within the parameters of current federal elections laws to win back the presidency — even if that includes taking money from corporations and billionaires alike.

TRUMP'S RECORD-BREAKING CASH HAUL REPORTEDLY RATTLING DEMOCRATS

""Joe Biden has spent his campaign promising elite donors that nothing will fundamentally change for them, and he has made clear to fossil fuel and pharmaceutical donors that he will be their ally,” Sanders’ campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement. “As a result, he has had trouble generating significant grassroots support from Americans who are getting crushed by those same big donors — and so his supporters are suddenly begging for help from super PACs, even though they are vehicles for the kind of corporate corruption that Democrats should be fighting to stop.”



""Let’s be clear: super PACs exist for one reason and one reason only: to help billionaires and corporations bankroll a presidential campaign with unlimited amounts of money, in exchange for favors,” he continued. “Every Democratic candidate should forcefully reject any help from super PACs -- and they should tell their supporters and surrogates to stop engaging with super PACs that aim to buy elections and undermine our democracy.”

Biden, who’s trailing his Democratic rivals in fundraising, said when he first announced his candidacy in April that he would not accept money from super PACs. The former U.S. senator from Delaware declared he was committed to driving perceived ""dark money"" from politics.

Before entering the 2020 race, Biden told PBS NewsHour in January 2018 that he was the one who told Sanders not to accept super PAC money, arguing he would lose the trust of the middle class.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN RESPONDS TO BIDEN’S ’60 MINUTES’ INTERVIEW, TAKES SWIPE AT HUNTER

“My positions are a hell of a lot closer to Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders on some of the economic positions,” Biden told PBS’s Judy Woodruff last year. “I mean, I sat with Bernie. I'm the guy that told him you shouldn't accept any money from a super PAC because people can't possibly trust you.”

Within the third quarter, Biden’s campaign raised $15.2 million but was left with just $9 million after expenditures, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign, which welcomes super PAC contributions, and the Republican Party together raised $125 million in that same time period for the president’s re-election, according to the Republican National Committee. Using these funds, Trump's campaign paid for attack ads targeting Biden amid an ongoing Democratic-led House impeachment inquiry against the president.

While Biden’s campaign this week softened its stance on accepting super PAC donations, Sanders boasted his bid for the presidency is 100 percent grassroots funded. Biden’s campaign told Fox News on Thursday that he is still committed to eradicating private donations from federal elections — but until he becomes president, is open to big-donor contributions to defeat Trump.

“As president, Joe Biden will push to remove private money from our federal elections. He will advocate for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United [a 2010 Supreme Cout decision on campaign financing] and end the era of unbridled spending by Super PACs,” Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, told Fox News.

“Until we have these badly needed reforms, we will see more than a billion dollars in spending by Trump and his allies to re-elect this corrupt president,” she continued. “And let’s be clear: Donald Trump has decided the general election has already begun. In this time of crisis in our politics, it is not surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law to bring an end to his disastrous presidency. Nothing changes until we defeat Donald Trump.”"

“Sometimes you have to be reminded about the vision you truly believe in, and where your core values lie,” Omar said. “And for me, I know that there are people that have to switch some things around, and there are people that are just easy to believe in. And I was reminded that Bernie is one of the people.”

Omar officially endorsed Sanders last week, joining fellow ""Squad"" member Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who appeared at a rally with Sanders last weekend.

The independent senator and 2020 presidential primary contender announced on Thursday his plan to legalize marijuana by executive order within the first 100 days of his administration should he win the White House.

Sanders, whose home state of Vermont in 2018 legalized possession of one ounce of pot and let each adult resident grow two plants for personal use, has long been a supporter of decriminalizing marijuana nationwide. He’s argued that the criminalization of the drug has ravaged communities of color and created an unequal incarceration rate.

“Too many lives were ruined due to the disastrous criminalization of marijuana,” Sanders wrote in a tweet announcing his plan.

Along with legalizing marijuana nationwide, Sanders also proposed expunging all past marijuana-related convictions and funneling some of the revenue from the legal marijuana business into communities hardest hit by the so-called War on Drugs.

“When we talk about criminal justice reform and ending institutional racism in America, we are talking about ending the disastrous War on Drugs, which has disproportionately targeted people of color and ruined the lives of millions of Americans,” his campaign said in a statement.

“It is time to admit the criminalization of marijuana was a disaster, especially for communities of color, and allow those most impacted to move forward with their lives. Our job now is to legalize marijuana and vacate and expunge past marijuana convictions, and ensure that revenue from legal marijuana is reinvested in communities hit hardest by the War on Drugs.”

Legalizing marijuana has gone from a once-fringe issue to a mainstream topic of debate as more states have let residents buy and grow pot.

OCASIO-CORTEZ, OMAR, TLAIB TO ENDORSE BERNIE SANDERS

Ten states and the District of Columbia already have legalized recreational marijuana, while there are only nine states in the nation where the drug remains fully illegal. Most states either have decriminalized it or have allowed it to be sold for medical uses.

A recent poll from Gallup found that 66 percent of Americans supported fully legalizing marijuana, almost double the number from 2005 when only 35 percent supported the move.

The sentiment across the country has been reflected among the 2020 Democrats with all supporting at least some form of legalization or decriminalization of the drug.

While Sanders was the first candidate to lay out an extensive plan for legalizing marijuana, fellow candidates and senators such as Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California have supported the Marijuana Justice Act. Introduced by Booker, the legislation would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and expunge existing cannabis-related criminal records.

The only major candidates who haven’t supported full legalization: former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

Biden said he supported decriminalization and rescheduling, criminal-record expungement and increased research access to marijuana, but argued it should be up to states to decide whether to legalize the drug. Klobuchar has said she supported decriminalization and legalization, but so far has not gone into specifics on her stance."

Elizabeth Warren enjoys a widening lead over former Vice President Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination — though another recent survey showed Biden holding the top spot.

Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, grabs the support of 28 percent of Democrats and independent voters who lean toward the Democrats in a survey released Thursday by Quinnipiac University. Biden stands at 21 percent in the poll, with populist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 15 percent.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

In Quinnipiac’s previous survey – conducted prior to the Oct. 15 fourth round Democratic debate – Warren had a slight 30-27 percent edge over Biden. But her advantage was within the poll’s margin of error. Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House bid, was at 11 percent.

Quinnipiac’s new survey showing Warren with a clear lead outside the sampling error stands in stark contrast to a national CNN poll conducted by SSRS released a day earlier that suggested Biden at 34 percent, with Warren a distant second at 19 percent and Sanders at 16 percent. The former vice president’s 15 percentage point lead was his largest since April in CNN polling.

During the spring and summer Biden remained the unrivaled front-runner in the Democratic 2020 battle, but then Warren surged and has been tied with the former vice president in many national and early primary and caucus voting state polls this autumn.

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg grabs 10 percent support in the new Quinnipiac poll, with Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 5 percent and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota at 3 percent. According to Klobuchar’s campaign, their candidate has now reached the polling threshold and qualifies for the next debate, which will be held next month in Georgia.

No other candidate in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential contenders topped 1 percent in the poll.

""Former Vice President Joe Biden slips, Senator Elizabeth Warren steadies, Senator Bernie Sanders gets his groove back, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg breaks back into double digits,"" Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow said in a statement.

The survey indicates Biden is still viewed as the candidate who has the best chance of winning against President Trump in the 2020 election. But his electability has deteriorated, from a high of 56 percent days after he declared his candidacy in late April, to 42 percent now.

Thirty percent of those questioned say Warren has the best policy ideas, topping the rest of the field. And Sanders is viewed as the most honest Democratic White House contender, at 28 percent.

THE LATEST 2020 POLLING FROM FOX NEWS

Among the nearly three-quarters of those polled who said they either watched October’s debate or paid close attention to news stories about it, 26 percent said Warren did the best job, followed by Buttigieg with 17 percent, Biden with 12 percent, Sanders at 11 percent, and Klobuchar at 8 percent. When asked who did the worst job in the recent debate, 15 percent said Biden and 11 percent said Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii.

""Despite coming under attack at the debate, Senator Elizabeth Warren was viewed as doing the best job, followed by South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigeig, which may have helped his standing in the primary,” Snow said. ""Last week's debate didn't help Vice President Joe Biden.”

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted Oct. 17 - 21, with 1,587 self-identified registered voters — including 713 Democratic voters and independents who lean toward the Democratic Party, questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of effort for Democratic primary questions is plus or minus 4.6 percentage points."

The issue centers around whether such a plan, estimated to cost $32-34 trillion over 10 years, can be sufficiently funded without significant tax increases on the middle class.

Warren has been asked for an explanation 17 times on the campaign trail, ""America's Newsroom"" host Sandra Smith noted, including at a debate last week. She has vowed to ""soon"" release a detailed plan and claimed that health care costs for Americans will go down dramatically, blunting any tax hikes.

""It may have to be a mea culpa,"" said Payne, wondering whether Warren will have to commit to a tax hike of some kind.

On the debate stage last week, Warren faced biting criticism from some of her rivals, including Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, who accused her of being dishonest about the plan's costs.

Accusing Warren of being evasive, Buttigieg argued that “your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything— except for this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multitrillion-dollar hole in this Medicare-for-all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.”

“In fact,” Lewis adds, “my family was not allowed on Air Force One because we refused to support Obama/Biden gun control efforts.”

Biden addressed Sandy Hook family members June 15, 2016, CBS News reported, but it was unclear whether all families were represented.

In another post, Lewis reminds his followers of another instance in which Biden got his facts wrong regarding a school shooting.

“I have, a handful of times, a long time ago, and I’ve also encountered a lot of people whose lives have really been shaken by the old war on drugs approach,” Buttigieg told Fox News in Las Vegas.

Nevada legalized marijuana for recreational use in 2017. Several other states have made similar moves, although the drug is still considered illegal on the federal level.

Buttigieg's ambitious proposal has been to “decriminalize all drug possession” while expanding access to addiction treatments and improving drug-abuse and mental-health treatment.

Buttigieg also said legalizing pot would carry numerous business advantages.

“First of all, without legalization, you’re going to continue to see a patchwork of different state laws that create a lot of problems for legitimate businesses like this one,” Buttigieg said outside the Top Notch dispensary in Vegas on a campaign stop.

He added, “We not only need to legalize but we also need to pursue experiments, knowing the racial disparity and lives that have been ruined by sentences over marijuana possession.”

Other 2020 Democrats seemed to be on the same page.

Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke toured an Oakland, Calif., dispensary last month, and called for allocating monthly stipends to people who were previously locked up for low-level marijuana offenses as a form of recompense.

Meantime, other candidates have admitted to using the drug before. California Sen. Kamala Harris, in a radio interview earlier this year, said, “I have, and I inhaled -- I did inhale. It was a long time ago, but yes.”

“I smoked marijuana twice — didn’t quite work for me,” he told Yahoo! News.

Candidates have split over how they would legalize marijuana federally. Buttigieg said it would need to be done through the proper legislative channels, while Sanders has expressed that he would use an executive order to carry it out.

Buttigieg agreed that the stigma surrounding marijuana use should diminish.

He also made a pitch specifically to veterans. “Yeah, so I've met a lot of veterans who rely on cannabis for the treatment of diagnosed or undiagnosed issues, often service-connected issues like post-traumatic stress. And, another benefit of decriminalization is, it could pave the way for this to be supported with” the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Asked by another reporter if he had bought any items in the dispensary, which he compared to an Apple Store in appearance, he said: “I will not. I’m on the clock and it’s gonna be a long day.”"

BIDEN, FACING CASH CRUNCH, FLIPS ON SUPER PAC SPENDING

NYT: “Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign effectively dropped its longstanding opposition to receiving the assistance of super PACs on Thursday, opening the door for wealthy supporters to spend unlimited amounts of money to try and lift him in the Democratic primary. The move represents a stark reversal and an implicit acknowledgment of his weakened position in the contest. He entered October with only $9 million in the bank, a fraction of his leading rivals. … As recently as a month ago, when a possible pro-Biden super PAC surfaced, his campaign denounced the effort. But on Thursday, Kate Bedingfield, his deputy campaign manager, softened that stance… ‘Let’s be clear: Donald Trump has decided that the general election has already begun,’ Ms. Bedingfield said. ‘He and his allies are already spending massive amounts of money on paid television and digital advertising to intervene directly in Democratic primaries with the goal of preventing Joe Biden, the opponent that Trump fears most, from becoming the Democratic nominee.’”



Biden still leads in Warren two-to-one in South Carolina - Fox News: “Joe Biden remains the clear front-runner in the latest poll in South Carolina – which holds the first southern primary in the race for the White House. But the former vice president’s lead is taking a hit as top-tier rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s support soars in the contest the Biden campaign sees as a firewall. Biden – who has longstanding ties in the state – stands at 33 percent among South Carolina voters likely to cast a ballot in the state’s February primary, according to a new poll from Monmouth University. That’s down 6 percentage points from Monmouth’s previous survey in the Palmetto State, which was conducted in July. Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, stands at 16 percent in the survey, a jump of 7 points from July. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is in third in the new poll, at 12 percent.”



Dems nudge debate threshold to 4 percent for December - Politico: “New thresholds announced by the Democratic National Committee for the sixth debate — which will be hosted by POLITICO and PBS on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles — represent only a modest step up from the criteria for the next debate in November. But they could still seriously endanger the participation of all but the top five candidates… To make the December debate, candidates must hit 4 percent support in at least four DNC-approved polls of primary voters nationally or in early-voting states (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina) — or, instead, they can qualify by hitting 6 percent in two approved early-state polls. Candidates must also bring in donations from 200,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 800 donors in 20 states, territories or the District of Columbia.”



Bernie’s small-donor numbers padded by repeat contributions - WSJ: “The February day that Bernie Sanders began his second Democratic presidential campaign, Christine Peloza gave him $27, the amount Mr. Sanders often boasted was the average donation in his first run. Then, she kept giving, in $3 increments, clicking donate up to 20 times a day. By the end of June, Ms. Peloza, a 34-year-old office manager at an elderly care facility in Illinois, had donated more than 850 times to Mr. Sanders… The Sanders campaign laid claim to the majority of these ‘super donors,’ the Journal found, with about 1,000 of them. The other Democrats in the race combined for at least 650 ultra-repeat givers, led by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who had at least 125. And President Trump’s re-election campaign, which began in 2017, has at least 250.”



Gabbard, facing dimming House hopes, drops re-election bid - Reuters: “Tulsi Gabbard, the last House member still in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, said Thursday she would not seek reelection for her Hawaii seat. ‘I believe I can best serve the people of Hawaii and our country as your President and Commander-in-Chief,’ she said in an announcement posted on Twitter. Gabbard’s decision clears the way for Hawaii State Senator Kai Kahele, who announced a primary challenge against her this spring. ‘I wholly respect and appreciate Congresswoman Gabbard’s decision not to pursue re-election for her Congressional seat as she pursues the Presidency,’ Kahele said in a tweet.”



THE RULEBOOK: GUT CHECK

“Let us now pause and ask ourselves whether, in the course of these papers, the proposed Constitution has not been satisfactorily vindicated from the aspersions thrown upon it; and whether it has not been shown to be worthy of the public approbation, and necessary to the public safety and prosperity.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 85



TIME OUT: LASTING LEGACY

WAMU: “There have been several stories recently highlighting the last time a Washington baseball team won a World Series. The answer most given is the Senators in 1924. Now, it’s true that the Senators were Washington’s last major league baseball team to win a World Series. But there was another very successful team to come afterward. The Homestead Grays won three Negro League World Series titles. … Now, there are plenty of reasons why baseball enthusiasts would disagree with this argument. They might say that the Grays were not exclusively a Washington team. They were founded in Pittsburgh in 1912 and didn’t start splitting time until 1940. … Like many Negro League teams, the Homestead Grays did not have a dedicated field. … Washington Senators owner Clark Griffith saw a financial benefit to letting the Grays play some of their games at his stadium in D.C.… Thus, the team became the Washington Homestead Grays.”

IMPEACHMENT WOES FOR SWING STATE GOP SENATORS

NYT: “Senate Republicans facing steep re-election races next year know the impeachment inquiry coursing steadily ahead on the other side of the Capitol will determine President Trump’s political fate. Their growing fear is that it will also determine their own. In a matter of weeks, those few senators have watched helplessly as the investigation by House Democrats has lobbed a grenade into the middle of their campaigns, putting them on the defensive amid a torrent of damaging revelations about the president’s conduct with no clear end in sight. It has tightened the squeeze they were already feeling between a political base that demands unquestioning loyalty to Mr. Trump, and the moderate swing voters who may very well decide their elections. And it is one reason that support for the president in the Republican-led Senate appears to be subtly softening, a phenomenon that some of his own advisers fear that Mr. Trump does not fully appreciate.”



Big bucks for Trump re-elect not trickling down to Senate runs - RCP: “President Donald Trump is raising record amounts of cash for his 2020 reelection. But that fundraising might isn’t spilling over to the most vulnerable Republicans fighting to hold onto their seats in a narrowly divided Senate. During the third quarter, former astronaut Mark Kelly took in $2.5 million more than Republican Sen. Martha McSally in Arizona. In Maine, state House Speaker Sara Gideon bested longtime Republican Sen. Susan Collins by over $1 million. And in Colorado, Cory Gardner, who led Senate Republicans’ campaign arm in 2018, barely outraised former Gov. John Hickenlooper, who had been in the race just five weeks before the quarter ended. The trouble for Republicans extends to states where they’re supposed to be on firmer ground. Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst didn’t crack $1 million and was outraised by the leading Democrat. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis narrowly outraised Democrat Cal Cunningham…”



OBAMA ON CUMMINGS: BEING STRONG MEANS BEING KIND

ABC News: “The funeral for Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings took place in his hometown of Baltimore Friday morning. ‘Elijah Cummings came from good soil,’ former President Barack Obama said in his eulogy. ‘A leader who once said he’d die for his people even as he lived every minute for them. His life validates the things we tell ourselves about what’s possible in this country -- not guaranteed, but possible.’ Obama went on to say that while hearing Cummings’ daughters speak at the funeral, ‘I was thinking I’d want my daughters to know how much I love them, but I’d also want them to know that being a strong man also means being kind, that there’s nothing weak about kindness and compassion. There’s nothing weak about looking out for others. There’s nothing weak about being honorable. You’re not a sucker to have integrity and to treat others with respect.’”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Per your response to a question From the Bleachers in [Thursday’s] Report, Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution provides that conviction post-impeachment can result in permanent disqualification from any federal office. My recollection is that this is an issue apart from mere conviction/removal—an additional punishment the Senate may, but need not confer. Apart from that, I suppose technically anyone can RUN for President, but if subsequent to conviction and with this disqualification applied, s/he would, if somehow elected, be legally barred from actually taking office. Love your Reports, and your appearances on FNC!” – Doug Chamberlain, Hooksett, N.H.



[Ed. note: Quite right you are. The Senate could apply that further sanction. I should have been clear on that point! Thank you for pointing it out.]



“Most batches or degrees do not prepare the recipient to do anything except further education. Taxpayer tuition is for the schools/universities, not students. Maybe ‘free’ tuition for a trade school would benefit the student and the community. I have two graduate degrees and have taught college level courses.” – Jim Fullilove, Shreveport, La.



[Ed. note: America has a most distressing educational problem. College graduation rates continue to rise while high-school graduation rates continue to fall. This is a reflection of a society in which a broad elite – maybe 30 percent of the country – sees increasingly better outcomes, while the remainder is falling farther behind. It strikes me that the important work ought to be done in improving secondary education before we just punt the problem into additional years of universal education.]



“What were you thinking when you included the beloved microwave burrito along with antiquities like Fireball shots or skinny jeans? To this day, I – who travel the roads often for business – can almost always find my comfort food, the microwave burrito, at any hour at any convenience store. It is the perfect culinary treat, containing every food group, … and prepared ‘fresh’ in an aged microwave found buried at the back of the store with pre-set numbered times - as to which you must simply guess. The cheese, beans and other contents are irregularly heated in wonderful patches, and the corners of the flour tortilla without moisture become perfectly crunchy (or just hard). The last salty savory bite from the bottom of the slightly melted plastic wrapper is like the last Oreo in a pack, and it compels you to wonder how much longer to the next highway exit or rest stop, where you might consider getting just one more. Comparing this oasis treat with unproductive party primaries and anti-constitutional, anti-‘democratic republic’ zanies is just wrong.” – Ken Levine, Lionville, Pa.



[Ed. note: Mr. Levine, you are a balm to a weary mind! But what you need, sir, are pepperoni rolls. On your next sojourn southwest, hang a left at Harrisburg down to Interstate 68 and ride down to North Central West Virginia. Buy a large bag – Country Club Bakery, if possible and under no circumstances with cheese – and toss them in your passenger seat. They are the ideal companion for long drives.]

MAYBE TRY FROOT LOOPS AFTER YOUR NEXT COMMUTE

UPI: “Researchers in Virginia said they trained rats to drive tiny cars and learned the activity was a means of stress relief for the rodents. The scientists at the University of Richmond's Lambert Behavioral Neuroscience Laboratory said they trained two groups of rats to operate the ‘rat-operated vehicle,’ or ROV, which works by having the rats push down on a copper bar that propels the tiny car forward. The rats were rewarded with Froot Loops cereal when they drove to the end of the enclosure. Kelly Lambert, head of the laboratory and lead author of the story … said researchers analyzed the rats' droppings and found both groups of rodents had an increase in hormones that control stress responses. … Lambert said the study could have implications for how researchers approach depression and other mental illnesses in humans.”

The event, to be co-hosted by The Washington Post on November 20, marks MSNBC's second debate gig this election cycle.

Maddow will be joined by MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell, NBC News White House correspondent Kristen Welker and Washington Post White House reporter Ashley Parker, an all-woman panel of moderators, the network said.

NBC raised eyebrows for including Maddow, who drew ratings for its cable network for pushing what critics have described as ""conspiracy theories"" during the two-year Russia investigation, as a debate moderator earlier this year as such a position is usually assigned to serious, unbiased journalists.

Maddow's debate performance was widely criticized for keeping much of her focus on the findings of then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report.

MSNBC OPINION HOST RACHEL MADDOW'S DEBATE PRESENCE WAS 'A LOSS FOR JOURNALISM,' CRITICS SAY

""One would think that NBC News, which purports to be a news organization, would go above and beyond to make sure its hosts’ line of questioning was fair and honest, especially given the backlash the network received for its decision to have a far-left pundit moderate a presidential debate,"" BlazeTV White House correspondent Jon Miller told Fox News.

Others slammed the ""conspiracy theorist"" on social media, saying her presence at a presidential debate was a ""disgrace.""

NBC has been under fire in recent weeks in the wake of the reporting from ""Catch and Kill"" author Ronan Farrow, who detailed the network's efforts to kill his Harvey Weinstein story and the alleged yearslong misconduct from its former star anchor Matt Lauer.

NBC NEWS REPORTEDLY RENEWS NOAH OPPENHEIM'S CONTRACT, DRAWING OUTRAGE: 'STATUS QUO HAS BEEN BLESSED'

Last week, a prominent women’s group called on the Democratic National Committee to pull its upcoming debate from MSNBC unless NBC News ""cleans house"" and launches an independent investigation into ""allegations of a culture of sexual abuse"" at the network.

UltraViolet Action, a leading national women’s organization, claimed the Democrats' fifth presidential debate shouldn’t happen if NBC didn't ditch its beleaguered leadership.

""The DNC needs to make it clear that they support survivors of sexual abuse and cancel the upcoming 2020 Democratic presidential primary debate on MSNBC until Comcast and NBC News take clear steps to clean up the toxic culture that exists across their networks,"" UltraViolet co-founder Shaunna Thomas said in a statement.

On Wednesday, a group of activists and sexual assault survivors from the organization held a protest outside NBC News' New York City headquarters.

The group called for NBCUniversal to fire NBC News president Noah Oppenheim, MSNBC president Phil Griffin and ""every other person in leadership that enabled abusers and silenced survivors"" at the Peacock Network.

""It's not just a Matt Lauer problem. It's a company-wide problem, and it's one that Comcast NBC needs to take seriously and demonstrate that they're taking seriously,"" Thomas said outside NBC’s famed 30 Rock.

""Time to fire up your heating system ... but I do hope you've got nat[ural] gas rather than home heating oil because, it's much cheaper,"" he said.

The average U.S. household pays $580 annually to heat their homes using natural gas, explained Varney, contrasting the low number to the $1,501 annual cost that home heating oil would accrue.

VARNEY WARNS 2020 DEMOCRATS AFTER REPORTS SHOW MIDDLE-CLASS INCOMES SPIKING UNDER TRUMP

""Give me that natural gas, please,"" he said.

According to the Department of Energy, the U.S. recently claimed the title as the world's leading natural gas producer.

""The Energy Department is committed to safe development of America’s natural gas resources. Among our efforts, we invest in innovative research projects, explore ways to develop natural gas from methane hydrates and support deployment of natural gas-powered alternative fuel vehicles, which are ideal for high-mileage, centrally fueled fleets that operate within a limited area,"" the DOE said of their efforts.

VARNEY: TRUMP SPEECH IN NATURAL GAS-RICH STATE MAY TURN THE TABLES ON DEMOCRATS

Many climate activists are quick to criticize the controversial energy method, which is obtained through a process known as fracking.

Fracking is the advanced process of extracting natural resources from deep below the earth by pumping thousands of gallons of water, chemicals, and sand into a deep well at extremely high pressure, creating cracks in methane-bearing shale, and allowing the gas to flow to the surface.

According to Varney, the U.S. currently holds the title of the ""King of nat gas fracking,"" as emissions from carbon dioxide have been greatly reduced in recent years.

VARNEY SLAMS 2020 DEMS' CLIMATE CHANGE CONTRADICTIONS

Listing the many benefits of switching to natural gas, Varney said he ""feels sorry"" for those living in states who haven't yet embraced the less expensive gas option, and slammed New York State officials for not allowing pipelines to transport natural gas from neighboring Pennsylvania.

""You have to feel a little sorry for people who live in states run by climate warriors,"" Varney said.

Many 2020 Democratic candidates have been vocal about their opposition to ""nat gas fracking"" as part of their climate change solution, specifically candidate Bernie Sanders, who said ""any proposal to avert the climate crisis must include a full fracking ban on public and private lands.""

Varney issued strong warnings to 2020 Democrats, saying ""voters will not look kindly on a fracking ban... and on expensive heating oil being shoved down their throats.""

""Voters everywhere have been rejecting costly climate dreams,"" he said.

""If there were a free vote and people could say yes or no to cheap energy, I'm pretty sure there will be a very strong yes vote,"" Varney continued.

""President Trump knows that,"" he concluded. ""The Democrats are still dreaming.""

MY PILLOW CEO SLAMS RECESSION 'FALSE NARRATIVE': 'THEY'RE GOING TO DESTROY ONE OF THE BEST ECONOMIES'

O'Grady and a panel of experts broke down some of the biggest proposals coming out of the current field of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates and how the ideas can be financed.

""Let's take Elizabeth Warren. She's promising $40 to $50 trillion in new spending over the next 10 years,"" said Brian Riedl, an economic policy expert and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. ""Let's assume $30 trillion of that can't come from the rich.""

STUART VARNEY ON KEEPING HOME HEATING BILLS DOWN THIS WINTER

""According to the Congressional Budget Office,"" continued Riedl. ""In order to raise $30 trillion, you would need either a payroll tax of 33 percent on top of the current 15 percent payroll tax. You're looking at about a 48 percent total payroll tax.""

""Or you could do a value-added tax, which is essentially a national sales tax, which is the other way Europe funds their welfare states,"" he suggested. ""You would need a 78 percent national sales tax to fund a $30 trillion agenda.""

""Are you saying that the government would take almost half of the income that your employer gives you? They would take that out even before you see that paycheck?"" asked O'Grady.

""That's correct. It would go from 15.3, which it is today, to nearly 50 percent for a payroll tax. That means ... nearly half of your paycheck would be taken out in the payroll tax. And of the remaining half, you're still paying the income tax. And when you go shopping, you're going to be paying sales tax. If there's a VAT tax, you're paying that. The cumulative effect of these taxes would be absolutely enormous,"" said Riedl.

""You can't get the proponents of these policies to talk openly about the taxes they require,"" he said, ""because once the American people find out what they cost, once they find out that Medicare-for-all isn't a free lunch -- support is going to collapse.""

BUTTIGIEG, KLOBUCHAR SLAM WARREN FOR NOT SAYING HOW SHE'LL FINANCES 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

""They do talk about it,"" said Fox Business Network host David Asman, ""but in the most dishonest way, I mean, it's like Liz Warren saying: 'Come on two pennies for a billionaire. What is two pennies?'""

Senator Warren's Democratic colleagues have called her out for not being fully transparent about the costs of the government programs that she is touting.

During the last Democratic presidential debate in Ohio, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar took Warren to task, saying: ""At least [Sen. Bernie Sanders is] being honest here in saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes will go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.”

And the thresholds for the White House contenders to make the debate stage are once again rising.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

The Democratic National Committee on Friday announced that the debate will be held on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs. The DNC said that PBS NewsHour and Politico will co-host the showdown.

The debate will be the first held on the West Coast, and specifically California. The Golden State is playing a larger role this cycle in determining the Democratic presidential nominee. California moved up the date of its primary and will be the largest of the 15 states scheduled to vote on Super Tuesday, which will be held on March 3 of next year.

To make the cut for the Dec. 19 debate, candidates must now receive at least 4 percent support in at least four qualifying national polls or surveys in the early primary and caucus states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina – or hit at least 6 percent in two qualifying polls in the early voting states. Only polls released between Oct. 16 and Dec. 12 will be considered.

The DNC is also upping the fundraising threshold. Candidates will now have to hit campaign contributions from at least 200,000 individual donors – with a minimum of 800 unique contributors in at least 20 states or the District of Columbia.

The candidates have until Dec. 12 – one week before the debate – to hit the fundraising and polling criteria.

SOME 2020 DEMS FUME OVER DNC'S DEBATE CRITERIA

Nine candidates out of the remaining field of roughly 17 Democratic White House contenders say they’ve hit the lower thresholds to make the stage for next month’s fifth-round debate, which will be held Nov. 20 in Georgia. They are former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, businessman and progressive advocate Tom Steyer, and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

Three candidates who reached the October debate stage are at risk of not qualifying for the November showdown. They are Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro of Texas, and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, also of Texas.

The DNC’s qualifying criteria have been repeatedly criticized by many of the middle- and lower-tier candidates for months. Activists also argue that the job of narrowing the field belongs to the voters in the early-voting states rather than with national party leaders.

Pushing back against the criticism, DNC Chairman Tom Perez told Fox News in September that the process has been “eminently fair” and added “we’re going “to continue to be transparent.”"

In a survey released today by Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, Warren maintains a seven-point lead over Joe Biden -- that's the candidate all the people on television assure us will be the Democratic nominee.

Warren is a full 13 points ahead of Bernie Sanders. Now keep in mind that both Warren and Sanders are Northeastern socialists. They're pulling from essentially the same strain of Democratic primary voters. Splitting that vote should dramatically weaken Warren's position in the field, but she is leading anyway. That's how dominant she is.

CHRIS WALLACE: 2020 DEMOCRATS LOOK 'NERVOUS' WHEN BIDEN SPEAKS AT DEBATES

So unless something unforeseen and dramatic happens between now and next spring -- and it could -- but if it doesn't, Elizabeth Warren will be the Democratic nominee. And that, as they say, has implications for all of us. There are her many terrible policy ideas -- Obviously we'll get to those in just a minute, but more immediately, there is Warren herself.

You're going to be seeing a lot of Elizabeth Warren over the next year. She'll be on your television screen nonstop. You will hear her voice rising from your car radio at red lights.

If you live in Iowa, New Hampshire, or South Carolina, you may find her in the flesh, loitering outside your Starbucks or waiting on your doorstep.

Prepare yourself because wherever there is Elizabeth Warren, there is falseness. Fake is who Warren is. She is authentically ersatz.

It turns out that pretending to be an Indian is not the least real thing Warren has ever done. She is always that synthetic, even when she is sitting around the kitchen, as seen in a video she was featured in earlier this year.

Elizabeth Warren: Hold on a sec. I'm going to get me a beer.

Hey, come over, my husband, Bruce, is now in here. You want a beer?

Bruce Mann, Elizabeth Warren's husband: No, I'll pass on the beer for now.

Warren: Let's, I'm going to pull up a stool and sit down.

It's hard to believe that's real. If you could play that again, please.

Warren: Hold on a sec. I'm going to get me a beer.

Hey, my husband, Bruce, is now in here. You want a beer?

Mann: No, I'll pass on the beer for now.

Warren: Let's -- I'm going to pull up a stool and sit down.

""I'll pass on the beer for now,"" says the off-camera figure -- who she says is her husband. It had to be an actor, right? No actual married couple could have an exchange that stilted. They'd have to be reading off cue cards, complete with intentionally bad grammar for that patina of middle-class authenticity.

Wherever there is Elizabeth Warren, there is falseness. Fake is who Warren is.

""I'm going to get me a beer,"" says the Harvard professor. Fetch me my Winston's. I'm hankering for a smoke. You have got to be kidding!

Except Elizabeth Warren isn't kidding. She expects you to believe every word of what she says, which means you're watching someone who will say literally anything. Whatever it takes.

In the primaries on the Democratic side, what it takes is maximum leftward pander. So that's what Warren has delivered this season. There's no issue in which she doesn't have the most radical possible position. And for now, it's working. Quinnipiac confirms that.

But how will Warren's positions on the issues play with the rest of the country in next fall's general election? Let's see.

On immigration, Warren wants to decriminalize all border crossings into this country. If that sounds crazy to you, you are hardly alone. Two-thirds of the country opposes that idea, too.

Warren also says she wants to abolish ICE, that's our federal immigration enforcement agency. How many Americans agree with her on that? Fewer than 25 percent agree with Elizabeth Warren on that.

Under her plan, we'd likely see a huge increase in illegal immigration, of course, and she has told us that every one of those foreign nationals is entitled to completely free health care, courtesy of you. How many Americans approve of that idea? Well, not that many, not surprisingly.

Though more than say they favor race-based reparations. And that's something else that Warren has called for. Sending people tax dollars based on their skin color is a genuinely unpopular idea in this country. But Warren doesn't seem to care.

As she has pointed out before, America is so racist, we deserve it.

Warren: We live in a country now where the president is advancing environmental racism, economic racism, criminal justice, racism, health care racism.

""Health care racism?!"" Hmm. You've got to wonder which bored teaching assistant in what mediocre state university thought up that phrase, ""health care racism"" -- and what it might mean.

Warren didn't bother to define it, of course. In her world, it is self-explanatory. You just add the word racism after any category of public policy, and all the ""woke"" kids nod in unison. ""Oh, health care racism. Yeah, man. It's systemic. This country was built on health care racism."" Of course, it was.

When you're slinging B.S. in such copious volume that even soulless hacks like Chris Matthews and Stephen Colbert wince a little bit when you deliver it, it's a sign. It's not a good sign.

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why we need ""Medicare-for-all."" It's a costly plan to be sure. But it's a plan that Elizabeth Warren -- because she is magic, being infused with the power of her ancestral Cherokee spirit animals -- can pay for without raising taxes on you, or anyone you know, or anyone you will ever meet. She can do that. She swears she can.

Marc Lacey, national editor for the New York Times/Democratic debate moderator: Will you raise taxes on the middle class for pay to pay for it? Yes or no?

Warren: Its costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working, middle-class families, costs will go down.

-----

Warren: Hard-working, middle class families are going to see their costs go down.

Stephen Colbert, host of ""The Late Show"": And all their taxes go up.

Warren: Well, but here's the thing ...

Colbert: But here's the thing, I've listened to these answers a few times before.

George Stephanopoulos, ABC News host: Will middle-class taxes go up? Will private insurance be eliminated?

Warren: What families have to deal with is cost -- total cost. That's what they have to deal with.

----

Warren: How much are your costs going to go down?

Chris Matthews, host of ""Hardball"" on MSNBC: No, no. Different question. How much will your taxes go up?

Warren: No, it's how much are your costs?

Matthews: How --

Warren: It's how much -- it's how much families end up spending.

Matthews: I know that argument, but will you pay more in taxes? But why don't you want to answer that question? Because as Jake said tonight, that's a Republican talking point. It's not a Republican talking point. It's a question.

Warren: It's a question about where people are going to come out economically. Look --

Matthews: No, that's not my question.

Warren: I spent -- I spent ...

Ouch. When you're slinging B.S. in such copious volume that even soulless hacks like Chris Matthews and Stephen Colbert wince a little bit when you deliver it, it's a sign. It's not a good sign.

Can someone like that really get elected president? Hmm. Maybe it's not accidental that at the very moment that Joe Biden's numbers collapse and Elizabeth Warren's numbers rose, Democrats in Washington started talking about Ukraine.

TOMI LAHREN ISN'T SHOCKED BY 'SQUAD'S ENDORSEMENT

""Well, the Democrats got their way,"" said Lahren.

""He said he would be willing to do it at no profit or, if possible, at zero cost to the American taxpayer...but of course, the Democrats and closeted Never Trump RINO's raised a stink and got their way,"" she added.

Last Saturday, Trump announced that his administration will no longer consider his personal resort in Doral, Fla., to host the 2020 G7 summit, and suggested he might consider the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland instead.

""Based on both Media & Democrat Crazed and Irrational Hostility, we will no longer consider Trump National Doral, Miami, as the Host Site for the G-7 in 2020,"" the president tweeted. ""We will begin the search for another site, including the possibility of Camp David, immediately. Thank you!""

The announcement followed earlier tweets in which he said he thought he ""was doing something very good for our Country"" by hosting world leaders at his Florida resort next year.

TOMI LAHREN WARNS YOUNG AMERICANS TO VOTE AGAINST SOCIALISM

“It is big, grand, on hundreds of acres, next to MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, has tremendous ballrooms & meeting rooms, and each delegation would have its own 50 to 70 unit building,"" he tweeted.

The president followed up by saying he had offered to host the summit at no profit to himself to avoid concerns about “emoluments violations.” He said if it were legally permissible, he’d offer to host the summit at no cost to the U.S.

Democratic lawmakers said Friday that past G7 summits have cost ""upwards of $40 million.""

“But, as usual, the Hostile Media & their Democrat Partners went CRAZY!” Trump wrote.

Agreeing with the president, Lahren slammed the Democrats for their ""freak out"" against the initial announcement, but applauded the president for ""folding on this particular battle.""

""Look, the Democrats with their raging Trump Derangement Syndrome are going to freak out and lash out at this president on a minute-by-minute basis regardless, but it was probably wise of President Trump to fold on this particular battle,"" said Lahren.

Lahren took aim at the Democrats' fear that the president would profit off the summit, and explained the sacrifice he and his family have made in his current role.

""To assert President Trump and his family have made money off his presidency is ridiculous,"" said Lahren. ""If anything, they’ve lost money, lost business deals, lost much of the brand presence they had before Donald Trump won the election and forever embittered the crybaby Left,"" she continued.

""And don’t forget the damage the Trump brand has suffered all because he won the election--boycotts, removals, vandalism and more,"" Lahren added.

Doubling down in her criticism, Lahren discussed Trump's background as a business mogul, and accused the Democrats of being ""jealous and bitter of his net worth.""

""In case no one was aware of this prior to the 2016 election victory, Donald Trump is and always has been a businessman. Do the Democrats really expect him to give up all of his assets, earnings and worldly possession simply because they are jealous of his net worth and bitter over his election victory?

""Furthermore, let’s not forget that President Trump donates his presidential salary,"" Lahren continued. ""Heck, socialist cheerleaders, Bernie Sanders and [Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] won’t do it. They won’t put their money where their mouths are.""

""At the end of the day,"" Lahren added, ""winning is what this all stems from. The daily smearing of our president and everything he does for this nation is all because the Democrats and Never Trump RINOs lost.

""They hate him because they ain’t him,"" she concluded.

COULD SENATE REFUSE TO HONOR HOUSE DEMOCRAT-LED 'IRREGULAR' IMPEACHMENT?

On Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive"" Wednesday, Burns said that the ""elephant in the room"" is that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., opted not to ask the full House of Representatives to vote on the question of opening a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump. Instead, Pelosi announced that an impeachment inquiry had begun, breaking precedent regarding these proceedings.

""You don't have to be a rocket scientist or an MIT professor to know that they didn't do a vote because they didn't want to have [Democratic House members] stand up in districts that were against it and have to vote for it,"" said Burns, adding that some moderate Democrats are hesitant to declare their support for impeachment.

He predicted that Democrats will eventually abandon their impeachment push.

""I think they're going to come out and [say]... 'We do not want to put the American public through this type of debacle. However, of course, it's fully warranted,'"" Burns said.

""There's always a rhetorical flourish for everything, which achieves your goals semantically and rhetorically,"" he added.

Wall Street Journal editorial board member William McGurn said he is skeptical of Burns' theory.

""I don't see how... Mrs. Pelosi, once she's taken this step, I don't see how you can do it and I think if you don't impeach the president, it looks like another Mueller report,"" argued McGurn. ""All these promises, 'We're gonna get him. We finally got him on the ropes and we don't do it.' I find it hard to believe the House won't impeach.""

Tom Del Beccaro, former chairman of the California Republican Party, conceded that Pelosi and her fellow Democrats have taken a huge political risk by pursuing impeachment.

""On November 1st [2018] in the Washington Examiner, I predicted that the Democrats would turn to impeachment if they got the House, because having the House isn't enough. You can pass a bill, but if it's not signed, their base was never going to be pleased,"" Del Beccaro said. ""I said they would go to impeachment regardless of the facts. So here we are and what [Burns is] saying is the facts truly don't justify this.""

However, Del Beccaro agreed with McGurn that Democrats will suffer politically if they don't follow through on their threats to impeach.

""The political point is that they have promised their base time and again and their base continues to move left -- [Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] going to Bernie Sanders -- all of this, can they simply lose face again in an election year? This is some of the biggest roll of the dice that I have ever seen.""

McGurn said: ""I also think it's a risk more broadly for Democrats. I sort of think [former president] Bill Clinton came out stronger because the impeachment failed in the Senate. I don't think that was clear at the time... if [Trump's] impeached and not convicted, I think it will look like another Muller report.""

Del Beccaro concluded: ""I think historians 50 years from now will look back on this as a misguided attempt.""

LEGAL EXPERT: PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SUCCESS WILL COUNT AGAINST HIM IN LAWSUIT AGAINST CNN

Former Obama State Department official and adviser to the Obama campaign David Tafuri said that Democrats will go through with impeachment, though it may take them longer than expected.

""I expect the Democrats will deliberate longer than we expect,"" Tafuri said. ""It's going to take longer for them to get there. I think they'll vote in favor of impeachment. Articles will go to a trial in the Senate. It can be hard for him to be removed because 20 Republican senators would have to switch... [but] you never know when you get to a jury what's going to happen. That's the mystery of a court process like this. When it goes to the jury, the jury gets to decide.""

The New York Times has not endorsed a Republican for president since 1956. Prior to the Mueller report, the influential paper published story after story about alleged Russian collusion with the Trump presidential campaign.

Project Veritas, the investigative reporting outfit that uses undercover video, recorded CNN employees complaining about the cable news organization's anti-Trump agenda. On one video, a voice, identified as CNN president and CEO Jeff Zucker, can be heard all but instructing his staffers to focus on impeachment, to the exclusion of what taped staffers say they considered other important news.

""There's a lot of people out here just trying to do what they think is the best of journalistic integrity,"" said one CNN staffer. ""Then you get on the 9 a.m. call and big boss Jeff Zucker f----ing tells you what to do.""

So if viewers assumed the debate moderators' questions wouldn't be tough, they weren't disappointed. Here are just 10 questions that were not asked:

GUTFELD ON THE TRUMP OBSESSION AT THE DEBATE

1. About the Trump tax cuts, Democrats like Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., claim that 83 percent of the benefits would go to ""the top 1 percent, richest people in this country, and the most powerful corporations."" But the Washington Post fact-checker said: ""The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that initially more than 80 percent of taxpayers would get a tax cut, with less than 5 percent getting a tax increase."" Why, then, do you keep restating what The Washington Post said isn't true?

2. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, for years, you've said, ""We are now spending twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country."" And for years, PolitiFact has said that's false. So why do you keep saying it?

3. Many of you support reparations, but former President Obama said, ""Children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime, nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison."" Isn't family breakdown a far bigger problem than a need for reparations?

4. In 1900, government at all three levels -- state, local and federal -- took less than 10 percent of Americans' income. Today, government takes close to 31 percent. How much more income should government take from the American people?

5. In 2017, nearly 40,000 Americans were murdered or committed suicide by firearms, so you've demanded that Congress pass ""commonsense gun control laws"" to save lives. But how many Americans are alive each year because they used firearms in self-defense?

6. Some of you have proposed a ""buyback"" of AR-15s and other ""weapons of war."" In 2018, according to the FBI, there were 297 people killed by rifles -- all rifles, not just AR-15s. But 443 people were killed by hammers, clubs and other blunt objects. And 672 were killed by ""fists, feet and other 'personal weapons.'"" Gun rights advocates argue that these numbers show you have lost perspective. Please comment.

7. You criticize President Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria. But when President Obama withdrew troops from Iraq, Democrats supported the policy -- even though it ran counter to the advice Obama got from his national security team. The withdrawal allowed ISIS to grow and metastasize. Obama sent back about 4,000 troops, and the troop level remains about 5,000. Is it not hypocritical to criticize Trump for doing the same thing that Democrats applauded Obama for?

8. Does President Trump deserve any credit for an economy that's producing rising incomes and record-low unemployment for blacks and Hispanics?

9. Rep. Beto O'Rourke, you say you've benefited from ""white privilege"" and that America is built on ""endemic"" and ""foundational"" racism. On the stage with you are New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, of African descent; Andrew Yang, of Chinese descent; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who is Samoan American; and California Sen. Kamala Harris, whose background is Jamaican and Indian. Why didn't ""endemic"" and ""foundational"" racism prevent these candidates of color from being on the same stage with you, on the same night, competing for the same job?

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

10. About Charlottesville, where a woman was killed by a white nationalist, you claim President Trump said there were good white nationalists and good neo-Nazis on ""both sides."" In fact, at that very same press conference, Trump said, ""I'm not talking about the white nationalists and the neo-Nazis -- because they should be condemned totally."" Why do you keep misquoting the president?

Compared to previous Democratic debates, this recent three-hour long one aired on CNN rated pretty bad. Who knows? A tough question or two might have generated a bit more interest.

Is 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton seriously mulling a third stab for the White House?

Clinton’s own comments and actions in recent weeks sparked the Washington buzz, fueling stories that she could possibly enter her party’s nomination race at this late date amid complaints from some Democratic Party insiders who view the current field of contenders too weak or progressive to take on President Trump next year.

LONGTIME HILLARY CLINTON ADVISER REFUSES TO RULE OUT A CLINTON 2020 BID

Clinton even indirectly took aim at Trump on Friday during the nationally televised memorial service for the late Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, who has vocally clashed with the president.

Comparing Cummings to the prophet Elijah, Clinton said to loud applause that “like that Old Testament prophet, he stood against corrupt leadership of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel.""

Longtime top Clinton adviser Philippe Reines also fueled the flames, saying in interviews this week with Fox News’ Tucker Carlson and Dana Perino that his old boss had not closed the door on a 2020 bid.

He told Carlson Clinton hasn't closed the door to running, saying she would ""think about it long and hard"" if she thought she had the best odds of beating Trump — while still calling the scenario unlikely.

“I think it’s somewhere between highly unlikely and zero but it’s not zero. I don’t know how to be more honest than that,” Reines said Thursday on Fox News' ‘Daily Briefing with Dana Perino.’

“To the extent that I talk to her about the race and just in general what she’s up to, I do think she’s been looking and watching wistfully, which is totally understandable given the race she went through in 2016,” Reines said.

The former first lady, senator from New York and secretary of state, and the first major-party female presidential nominee, has essentially remained in the spotlight ever since losing the 2016 election to Trump — yet winning the national popular vote.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL RACE

But her comments and actions in recent weeks have elevated her relevance in the 2020 campaign to a new level, renewing questions about her role in the race for the White House and sparking some speculation that she still has presidential ambitions despite past claims to the contrary.

The latest episodes include Clinton tweeting “Don’t tempt me” in response to Trump's suggestion about running in 2020; mocking Trump’s interactions with foreign leaders; and arguing without evidence that Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii is a “Russian asset” — a swipe that injected her into the 2020 primary battle, even from the sidelines.

A top aide downplayed the 2020 speculation, however.

“The short of it is that she’s on a book tour and is feeling unconstrained about speaking her mind,” longtime Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told Fox News earlier this week. “It’s easy to over-ascribe a strategy about every word she utters, but it’s as simple as that. She’s out there telling the truth.”

CLINTON MULLING WHITE HOUSE BID, CITING WEAK FIELD, ACCORDING TO REPORTS

But the story went viral on Tuesday, with a New York Times report that Clinton in recent weeks stated she would declare her candidacy if she were certain she would win the race.

The article, headlined “Anxious Democratic Establishment Asks, ‘Is There Anybody Else?’,” noted that about a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered in New York City raised concerns whether former Vice President Joe Biden – a co-front-runner – could stand strong against Trump, and worried about his fundraising struggles and the need to defend his son Hunter Biden over business dealings in Ukraine amid the House impeachment inquiry into the president. Those gathered also said Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders were likely too liberal to win the general election.

An adviser close to the Biden world, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, said the former vice president’s camp is not taking the media reports seriously and they continue to “move ahead.”

And in the crucial first primary state of New Hampshire, a top Democrat says concern with the field and a hunger for another candidate is not a topic of conversation that she's heard.

“I’ve heard nothing about people wishing someone else would get into the race,” said Kathy Sullivan, a longtime Democratic National Committee member and former New Hampshire Democratic party chair.

Sullivan, who backed Clinton in the 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns, told Fox News, “I’m not taking this seriously. I love Hillary Clinton and I think she’d be a fantastic president but there is a lot of really good people running for president right now. I think it’s too late in the day for someone to get into the race. I don’t take it seriously and I don’t think it’s a good idea and we don’t need to have anyone else in the race right now.”

It is getting late in the game, especially in New Hampshire, where Nov. 15 is the last day for a candidate to file to get their name on the first-in-the-nation presidential primary ballot.

And a longtime Democratic veteran of over 10 New Hampshire primaries noted that “we’ve seen this before. It’s not an uncommon Democratic trait to long for someone who is not in the race. It’s like pre-buyer’s remorse. Shopper's remorse.”

WHAT WILL WE MAKE OF OUR MOMENT?

Periods of political upheaval can be wonderful things. Needed changes once deemed politically impossible suddenly become realities. Old superstitions and their totems can finally be discarded.



But it’s never all good.



The tumult of the first half of the 1970s is instructive. After that period, which included the resignations of the vice president and then president over corruption and abuses of power, Washington ushered in much-needed ethics reforms. Congress cracked down on payola for members and mandated financial disclosure for itself and the other two branches.



But that same era resulted in the birth of the modern political primary system that wreaks increasing damage on the republic cycle after cycle. Getting rid of smoke-filled rooms may have decreased the power of party bosses, but has introduced more demagoguery – both fanatical and fantastical – to our public life.



Like last-call shots of Fireball, microwave burritos and men in skinny jeans, it sounded like a good idea at the time.



As the parties clash this time in Washington, we don’t know what the era to come will bring. Which will be the positive changes to laws and attitudes born from this era of political chaos unseen four decades? Which will be ones that linger like a Fireball hangover?



With this in mind, consider the offering from today’s WaPo: “The Constitution isn’t the cure for President Trump. It is the cause.” by Shira Lurie, a history professor at the University of Toronto who formerly taught at the University of Virginia.



We encourage you to read her piece to get a fuller understanding of the argument, but her basic effort is to caution those involved in the struggle to either oust or constrain President Trump by constitutional means are simultaneously deepening our esteem for our flawed founding charter.



“Democrats can and should seek a constitutional remedy to remove Trump,” she writes. “But we need to confront the idea that a president who lost the popular vote by millions, deceives the public, attacks the press and does not have the confidence of the majority of Americans may not be a distortion of the constitutional order, but a feature.”



We wondered whether to even call attention to the piece lest we be guilty of that version of straw man argument that The Dispatch’s David French has delightfully dubbed “nut picking.” That’s when you find a fringe character from an opposing point of view and drag them forward to suggest that some far-flung idea is really mainstream.



Lurie is not in the political mainstream. In fact, she acknowledges it by expressing concern that Democrats are expressing excessive reverence for the Constitution.



“Worshiping the Constitution as a sacred text is not patriotism, it’s fanaticism,” she warns. “We can continue to pray to it, but it won’t save us. It is high time to address the anti-democratic foundations of American government.”



But we fear that the bipartisan reverence for our founding is actually pretty surficial these days. Leaders in both parties are closer to Lurie than she knows.



When the executive branch shows absolute contempt for the clearly stated powers of the legislative branch in a letter that sounds like it was dictated by Huey Long from a balcony you don’t get that good ol’ separation-of-powers tingle.



When Democratic presidential candidates willy-nilly offer proposals that ignore not only those same separations but doing so using the kind of cheap demagoguery that defies the principles of both the Constitution and the Declaration, one doesn’t feel the gentle breezes of a return to Madisonian democracy.



Our era will produce substantial change for the generations to come. Whatever shape that takes, we would do better to avoid the mistakes of the past and use our era to strengthen, not diminish, the Constitution that has seen us through this and all of our previous crises.

TIME OUT: DEMOCRATIC DUNGAREES

Atlantic: “If you want to sell clothes in America, it helps a lot if buyers think your product is cool. Jeans have a backstory that any marketer would kill for. ‘Denim first became popular in the 1920s and 1930s in tandem with the rise of Hollywood,’ explains Emma McClendon, an associate curator at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, who orchestrated a denim retrospective at the museum in 2015. … Over the years, the cuts and washes changed, but denim’s position as a relatively democratic element of the wardrobes of stylish, influential people didn’t. … In the past, only one or two styles of jeans were “cool” at a given time. … Now denim inventory is as infinite as the internet itself. Fast-fashion retailers update their selections constantly, which means that nearly every type of denim is available simultaneously. Depending on whom you ask, the big thing right now might be mom jeans.”

GRAHAM SET TO SQUEEZE FELLOW GOPERS WITH SHOW VOTE

AP: “GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, a top ally of President Donald Trump, is introducing a resolution condemning the Democratic-controlled House for pursuing a ‘closed door, illegitimate impeachment inquiry.’ Graham announced the move Thursday and says the Senate’s top Republican, Mitch McConnell, is a co-sponsor. Graham plans a Thursday afternoon news conference. The nonbinding resolution gives Senate Republicans a chance to show support for Trump at a moment when Trump is urging his GOP allies to get tougher and fight harder for him as the House impeachment probe gathers momentum. Many Senate Republicans are taking a wait-and-see approach amid the House impeachment inquiry. Rather than commenting on the substance of the probe, they are united in complaining that the House is taking depositions from witnesses behind closed doors.”



Some senators are keeping impeachment thoughts to themselves - Politico: “[Susan Collins] is among a group of senators from both parties who are increasingly citing their role as possible jurors in an impeachment trial. They argue that as impartial jurors, they shouldn't make any foregone conclusion — especially about a scandal that could force Trump out of office. … Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee agrees, saying jurors shouldn’t be ‘running around announcing their decision until they’ve heard the arguments.’ … The reserved nature of Republicans like Alexander, who is retiring, and the moderate Collins suggests some in the president's own party are legitimately open to Democrats' arguments — an ominous sign for Trump… It also has the added side benefit of excusing senators from the noisy, day-to-day chaos of the president’s investigation by Congress.”



Dems prepare to go public with probe - WaPo: “House Democrats are preparing to move their largely private impeachment inquiry onto a more public stage as soon as mid-November and are already grappling with how best to present the complex Ukraine saga to the American people. Over the past three weeks, a parade of current and former Trump administration officials have testified behind closed doors, providing House investigators with a compelling narrative of President Trump’s campaign to extract political favors from Ukrainian officials. … Among the witnesses Democrats hope to question in open session are the acting ambassador to Ukraine, William B. Taylor Jr., and his predecessor, former ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. Both are seasoned diplomats who, in earlier House testimony, effectively conveyed outrage over a White House plan to withhold much-needed military aid from Ukraine…”



Wisconsin sees increase in support for impeachment - Marquette University: “A new Marquette Law School poll of Wisconsin registered voters finds that 46 percent think that there is enough cause now for Congress to hold hearings on impeachment of President Donald Trump, while 49 percent say there is not enough cause and 5 percent say they do not know. In April 2019, 29 percent said there was sufficient reason for impeachment hearings and 65 percent said there was not. The April poll was completed after Attorney General William Barr’s letter describing the Mueller report but before the report was publicly released. Earlier, in January 2019, 33 percent supported and 59 percent opposed hearings.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Loyalty to the Constitution - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano questions President Trump’s relationship to upholding the Constitution: “After a weekend of torrential criticism, Trump announced that he had changed his mind and said he would not host the G-7 meeting at the Miami area resort. Yet, in the process of doing so, he characterized the Emoluments Clause as ‘phony.’ Who knows what he meant by phony? The clause is in the Constitution and it means what it says. Yet, whatever Trump meant by phony, it constituted at least a disparagement of the Constitution he has sworn to uphold and at worst a threat to ignore clauses he can disparage. This is most unusual and potentially dangerous, and it raises the question: Can the president lawfully enforce only the clauses of the Constitution with which he agrees and ignore those with which he disagrees? In a word: No.” More here.



Q POLL: WARREN AHEAD, BUT WORRIES ABOUT ELECTABILITY

Quinnipiac University: “Senator Elizabeth Warren has opened up a lead in the Democratic primary race after being locked in a tight race with former Vice President Joe Biden for several weeks, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. Warren receives 28 percent of the vote among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, while Biden gets 21 percent. Sen. Bernie Sanders gets 15 percent, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg gets 10 percent, Sen. Kamala Harris is at 5 percent and Sen. Amy Klobuchar is at 3 percent. No other candidate tops one percent. … Biden is still viewed as the candidate who has the best chance of winning against Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election… In today's poll, Biden gets 42 percent, but this is down from 48 percent in the October 14 poll… Warren comes in second on this electability question with 20 percent, followed by Sanders at 14 percent.”



Biden really slipping in fundraising pack - Politico: “Joe Biden’s campaign is drawing more support from big-ticket donors than any other candidate in the race — yet he still can’t match his rivals’ cash flow. Biden has raised $20.7 million from contributions of at least $500 — $1.5 million more than his nearest competitor, despite entering the race later than all of them — thanks to the former vice president’s strong connections and goodwill among the traditional donors who have long financed the Democratic Party. … But it’s been nowhere near enough to make Biden the leader of the fundraising pack. In fact, his big-dollar dominance, and his reliance on those donors, is more evidence of how quickly small-dollar donations have become the most important component of political fundraising in a sprawling, fractured Democratic race. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg are all outraising Biden, and stockpiling cash significantly faster than him, on the back of major support from online donors that Biden has been unable to build.”



Tim Ryan bows out - NBC News: “Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, ended his long-shot presidential campaign after months of struggling to find a footing in the crowded Democratic field. Ryan announced his decision to end his campaign in a video to supporters, stating he would run again for his House seat. He isn’t throwing his support behind anyone in the 2020 field at this time, his campaign told NBC. ‘I got into this race in April to really give voice to the forgotten people of our country: the workers who have been left behind, the businesses who have been left behind, the people who need health care or aren’t getting a quality education, or are saddled by tremendous debt,’ Ryan said. 'I'm proud of this campaign because I believe we’ve done that. We’ve given voice to the forgotten communities and the forgotten people in the United States.'""



Moderators announced for November debate - NBC News: “The fifth Democratic presidential primary debate in Georgia will have four moderators, MSNBC announced on Wednesday — and all of them are women. Moderating the Nov. 20 event, which is being co-hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post, will be Rachel Maddow, host of ‘The Rachel Maddow Show’ on MSNBC; Andrea Mitchell, host of ‘Andrea Mitchell Reports’ on MSNBC and NBC News' chief foreign affairs correspondent; Kristen Welker, NBC News' White House correspondent; and Ashley Parker, a White House reporter for The Washington Post. The debate will likely feature a smaller lineup of candidates than the dozen who qualified for October's debate in Ohio — only eight candidates have qualified for the debate stage so far, according to an unofficial NBC News tally. It will also be shorter than the three-hour October debate — it's scheduled to air from 9 to 11 p.m. ET.”



BORIS JOHNSON LAUNCHES BID FOR DECEMBER ELECTION

Fox News: “Boris Johnson will launch an attempt to hold a general election in Britain on December 12 to ‘get Brexit done.’ The British prime minister will attempt to convince members of Parliament to formally back the bid on Monday, but he will need the support of two-thirds of the House of Commons. Britain's next scheduled election is not until 2022. Johnson's move comes after his Brexit bill was finally passed earlier this week, but lawmakers defeated his request to push through the legislation in a three-day timetable, saying it didn't provide enough time for scrutiny. He said he expected the European Union to grant an extension to his October 31 deadline, likely to be to the end of January. The EU is expected to give its verdict on an extension on Friday. The prime minister said the Dec. 12 date will give lawmakers time before the election to scrutinize his Brexit bill. Under his plan, Parliament would remain working until Nov. 6, when campaigning would start.”

AUDIBLE: AMEN

“Back in 2015, his city roiled by unrest, by day the congressman was here in the Capitol working and leading in these hallways of power. But every night he rode the train back home and walked the neighborhoods, bullhorn in hand, encouraging unity and peace. Here’s what he said: ‘Let’s go home. Let’s all go home.’ Now our distinguished colleague truly has gone home, home to his Father’s house.” – Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in his condolences for Rep. Elijah Cummings as he lies in state at the U.S. Capitol Thursday.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Without asking you to necessarily weigh in on the ‘wisdom’ of same (unless of course you want to), I have two ‘technical’ and hypothetical impeachment questions: If a president is impeached and IS convicted in the Senate, is he/she eligible to run for re-election? (Somewhat similar situation to Marion Barry in Washington, D.C.) If a president is impeached but is NOT convicted in the Senate, could the House vote to re-impeach the president the next day (perhaps even ad infinitum) in a political ground hog day?” – Dave Wittnebert, Seneca, S.C.



[Ed. note: Most certainly, Mr. Wittnebert. President Trump could be removed from office and seek the presidency a second time, and he could be acquitted in the Senate and be re-impeached. But you’d have to think either scenario would be vanishingly rare. We talk often about impeachment being a political, not legal proposition. But that applies to its aftermath, too. If Trump becomes such a boat anchor that Senate Republicans feel obliged to cut ties with him, it will be because he is too great a political liability/embarrassment. If he is let off by the Senate, House Democrats will move urgently to pivot away from what will almost certainly be a somewhat embarrassing anti-climax.]



“I'm doing a bit of head scratching over what I see as competing information. By this I mean that I'm seeing President Trump's approval rating on a swift downhill slide and at the same time I'm hearing that the Democrats are hand-wringing over whether they have a candidate that can defeat him in 2020. Who needs to be more concerned?” – Neil Klapthor, Evans, Ga.



[Ed. note: The one who’s trailing a year from today! I kid, I kid… mostly. The past three weeks have been brutal for Trump, partly because of Democrats’ closing ranks and prosecuting their impeachment with vigorous determination. But it’s mostly been self-inflicted. Will the trend continue? Almost certainly not. It may get worse for the incumbent over time if further revelations drive a wedge between Trump and the GOP or it may get worse for Democrats because their own penchant for infighting will re-emerge. I suspect it will probably be quite a bit of both. But there are other considerations, particularly the health of the economy in the first two quarters of 2020. Given how much farther this river runs, it’s probably best to sail with the current for now and enjoy the view. We won’t find out who’s going over Niagara for a while yet.]

A PUMPKIN SPICE FLOAT

WTVC: “Around this time of year, most people take to carving pumpkins. But a farmer in Cleveland, Tennessee took things one step further. Justin Ownby grew a massive pumpkin that weighed 910 pounds… But he was not satisfied merely by its ornamental delights that enhance the season. Ownby's wife Christin Ownby shared video with WTVC that shows Ownby hollowed out the pumpkin, and converted to a buoyant watercraft that he tested on his farm's pond. A second video has someone off camera asking him to do his impression of ‘Washington crossing the Delaware!,’ and Ownby stands up as the pumpkin submerges under the sudden weight. Ownby says Justin used a seed to grow the pumpkin that came from a record-breaking pumpkin grown in Tennessee that weighed more than 1,700 pounds. … Christin Ownby says the pumpkin remains floating in the pond at last check, saying ‘It will make a great snack for the catfish!’”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“When I was growing up, I thought ‘gyp’ was simply a synonym for ‘cheat,’ and used it accordingly. It was only when I was an adult that I learned that gyp was short for gypsy. At which point, I stopped using it. … Why? Simple decency. … It’s a question not of who or how many had their feelings hurt, but of whether you want to associate yourself with a word that, for whatever historical reason having nothing to do with you, carries inherently derogatory connotations.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Oct. 17, 2013.

Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said the 48-hour power outage was to affect nearly 180,000 homes and businesses in portions of 17 counties in the Sierra foothills and north of the San Francisco Bay Area.

The Santa Rosa Fire Department tweeted that shutoffs had started in the city and it was getting multiple reports of outages.

""Public Safety Power Shutoffs have begun in Santa Rosa. We have multiple reports of outages from the Rincon Valley and Oakmont Areas,"" the department wrote.

The utility previously cut off power from Oct. 9-12 to more than 2 million people across the Bay Area to prevent high winds from toppling lines that could then spark deadly wildfires like one that did massive amounts of damage last year.

PG&E BEGINS 2ND WAVE OF CALIFORNIA PLANNED POWER OUTAGES TO HEAD OFF WILDFIRE RISK

The new rolling blackouts have elicited frustration from residents and business owners and have spurred purchases of batteries, generators and other emergency supplies.

""Working this close to the last outage is going to be a true trial by fire,"" said Garrett Sanders, owner of Love Birds Coffee & Tea in the old Gold Rush town of Placerville.

Sanders said he lost around $6,000 in the last outage. He said he planned to brew coffee and stock up on pastries for a sidewalk sale.

He sympathized with the argument that the outages are designed to prevent more devastating wildfires. Some Placerville residents relocated from Paradise, a town leveled by last year's fast-moving Camp Fire.

Not everyone is as understanding, however. Angry customers took things further in the earlier power outage, with a PG&E office in Oroville vandalized with eggs.

Authorities were also investigating an attack in which a PG&E utility truck was shot in Colusa County, and the wife of one utility worked pleaded with the public to not lash out at workers.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a letter to Bill Johnson, PG&E's CEO, the utility has failed to upgrade and maintain its equipment, resulting in the massive blackouts and the inconvenience to customers.

""I believe the unacceptable scope and duration of the previous outage — deliberately forcing 735,000 customers to endure power outages — was the direct result of decades of PG&E prioritizing profit over public safety,"" Newsom wrote

PG&E has denied the blackouts are about saving money in the wake of a string of lawsuits over its role in last year's fires.

This should be an enlightening moment for all American women – Democrats, Republicans and independents.

Get ready for the 2024 elections. Former South Carolina Gov. and U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley – or any other woman brave enough to run for president – will be savaged by other women with accusations of betrayal, incompetence and malfeasance.

What has become clear is that if a woman is not in lockstep with Clinton and the establishment Democrats, they will oil her ladder to the final glass ceiling.

The accusation that Gabbard – who represents Hawaii in the U.S. House and has been decorated for her service in the Army National Guard – could be working for a hostile foreign power should not be taken seriously.

So what on Earth has Gabbard done to attract Clinton’s scorn?

Perhaps Gabbard was attacked because while she says she is pro-choice she holds a marginally more nuanced view on abortion than Clinton.

Or perhaps Gabbard was attacked because she openly declares her love for our country, which undermines the leftist narrative that America is inherently evil and should be fundamentally transformed.

I don’t support Gabbard. But her treatment by the Clinton Machine should be called out.

Of course, the leftist media wants in on the fun. They have a long history of unjustly attacking women who disagree with them on issues, while not going after women more sympathetic to their views.

For example, feminist Tina Fey was eager to portray Sarah Palin on “Saturday Night Live” as a mindless puppet of the Republican Party. When Fey said “I can see Russia from my house” – in her role portraying Palin – the media practically treated the line as if Palin had actually said those words (she never did).

There has yet to be a similarly caustic depiction of far-left Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., on “SNL.”

Instead, we have a very public transformation by Clinton into the character Regina George, the female antagonist who torments anyone who doesn’t conform to her standards, brought to life in Fey’s “Mean Girls,” a film whose purpose was to push sisterly bonds of feminism.

Hollywood loves to pile on. After Trump was elected, Madonna chimed in by saying that “it feels like women betrayed us.”

In 2016, Democrats asked women to elect Hillary Clinton as the first woman president. If Clinton supporters were met by any reluctance – including on issues of policy from both their own base or by Republicans – they quoted former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who said: “There’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other.”

However, this sisterly solidarity was ignored in 2018, when feminists offered no assistance to Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn when she successfully campaigned to become the first woman senator from Tennessee.

Rather than support Blackburn, the feminists campaigned for a 74-year-old man dusted off from the shelf of retirement because they couldn’t bring themselves to support a woman with whom they disagreed on important issues.

Voting on a candidate’s policy positions rather than gender is fair enough and makes sense. But why on Earth should Democrats be surprised when women do the exact same thing when voting for a Republican?

What should worry American women isn’t the feigned surprise when Democrats are confronted with the fact that women have a diverse range of thought. What should worry us is the accusation that those of us whose views include supporting President Trump are either disloyal to our sex or unintelligent and incapable of discerning the “truth” and victims of “internalized misogyny.”

Truthfully, doesn’t the view by some women that other women can’t look at the facts and legitimately come to a different conclusion meet the definition of internalized misogyny? This is the natural consequence of dividing people into identity groups, certainly, but it’s also an unmasking of feminist hypocrisy.

I truly believe the first woman president will be a Republican, and she will get elected running on issues and by casting vision for the nation – not by suggesting we all fall in line and say “I’m With Her.”

Bernie Sanders’ campaign on Thursday accused Joe Biden of selling out to big donors in an effort to “buy the election” following reports that the former vice president and frontrunner for the Democratic Party’s 2020 presidential nomination would form a super PAC to accept unlimited donations from billionaires and corporate elites to cure his current fundraising woes.

A spokesperson for Biden’s campaign responded Thursday evening, telling Fox News in a statement that, in the eyes of President Trump, “the general election has already begun,” and Democrats must use any means possible within the parameters of current federal elections laws to win back the presidency — even if that includes taking money from corporations and billionaires alike.

TRUMP'S RECORD-BREAKING CASH HAUL REPORTEDLY RATTLING DEMOCRATS

""Joe Biden has spent his campaign promising elite donors that nothing will fundamentally change for them, and he has made clear to fossil fuel and pharmaceutical donors that he will be their ally,” Sanders’ campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement. “As a result, he has had trouble generating significant grassroots support from Americans who are getting crushed by those same big donors — and so his supporters are suddenly begging for help from super PACs, even though they are vehicles for the kind of corporate corruption that Democrats should be fighting to stop.”



""Let’s be clear: super PACs exist for one reason and one reason only: to help billionaires and corporations bankroll a presidential campaign with unlimited amounts of money, in exchange for favors,” he continued. “Every Democratic candidate should forcefully reject any help from super PACs -- and they should tell their supporters and surrogates to stop engaging with super PACs that aim to buy elections and undermine our democracy.”

Biden, who’s trailing his Democratic rivals in fundraising, said when he first announced his candidacy in April that he would not accept money from super PACs. The former U.S. senator from Delaware declared he was committed to driving perceived ""dark money"" from politics.

Before entering the 2020 race, Biden told PBS NewsHour in January 2018 that he was the one who told Sanders not to accept super PAC money, arguing he would lose the trust of the middle class.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN RESPONDS TO BIDEN’S ’60 MINUTES’ INTERVIEW, TAKES SWIPE AT HUNTER

“My positions are a hell of a lot closer to Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders on some of the economic positions,” Biden told PBS’s Judy Woodruff last year. “I mean, I sat with Bernie. I'm the guy that told him you shouldn't accept any money from a super PAC because people can't possibly trust you.”

Within the third quarter, Biden’s campaign raised $15.2 million but was left with just $9 million after expenditures, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign, which welcomes super PAC contributions, and the Republican Party together raised $125 million in that same time period for the president’s re-election, according to the Republican National Committee. Using these funds, Trump's campaign paid for attack ads targeting Biden amid an ongoing Democratic-led House impeachment inquiry against the president.

While Biden’s campaign this week softened its stance on accepting super PAC donations, Sanders boasted his bid for the presidency is 100 percent grassroots funded. Biden’s campaign told Fox News on Thursday that he is still committed to eradicating private donations from federal elections — but until he becomes president, is open to big-donor contributions to defeat Trump.

“As president, Joe Biden will push to remove private money from our federal elections. He will advocate for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United [a 2010 Supreme Cout decision on campaign financing] and end the era of unbridled spending by Super PACs,” Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, told Fox News.

“Until we have these badly needed reforms, we will see more than a billion dollars in spending by Trump and his allies to re-elect this corrupt president,” she continued. “And let’s be clear: Donald Trump has decided the general election has already begun. In this time of crisis in our politics, it is not surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law to bring an end to his disastrous presidency. Nothing changes until we defeat Donald Trump.”"

But a former Biden aide who is expected to play a major role in the group's effort, who asked for anonymity to speak more freely, emphasized that the formation of the super PAC is “a sign of reality.”

SANDERS SLAMS BIDEN REVERSAL ON SUPER PAC SUPPORT

Then-senator Biden struggled to raise campaign cash during his unsuccessful 1988 and 2008 runs for the Democratic presidential nomination. But after serving eight years as vice president, Biden’s fundraising woes in his third White House bid come as a bit of a surprise.

Biden had just under $9 million in his campaign coffers as of October 1, after spending more money than he raised during the July-September fundraising quarter. That’s far less than his top rivals Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who reported $25.7 million cash on hand, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who reported having a whopping $33.7 million in the bank.

Biden raised $15.2 million during the third quarter – far less than the hauls by Sanders and Warren. And he was also topped for a second straight fundraising period by South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

AMID CAMPAIGN CASH WOES, BIDEN CAMPAIGN SAYS THEY HAVE THE MONEY 'TO RUN OUR RACE'

Sanders and Warren raised much of their money online, using grassroots outreach to bring in small-dollar donations.

“Older voters like Joe's don't necessarily play this online small donor game,” the aide tied to the super PAC explained. “And we have to take reality the way we see it, in terms of our donor base, what they're resources are.”

While many of the top donors who have contributed to Biden have maxed out at this point in the race, the new super PAC gives them another avenue to donate to the former vice president.

A Democratic strategist who worked on Biden’s 2008 campaign and Sanders’s 2016 team said that the former vice president’s decision on Thursday to open the door to super PAC support – reversing an earlier ban on support from outside groups – is anything but a sign of strength for the once unrivaled front-runner in the polls.

“It’s definitely a choice that comes in a moment when his financials aren’t competing with Bernie, Warren and Buttigieg. Giving a wink to outside help may alleviate some of that gap, but it’s done as his opponents are putting up huge grassroots numbers, so it’s hard to say that this doesn’t seem reactionary to that,” noted consultant Julia Barnes, who’s currently not working for any presidential campaign.

Biden is fighting a two-front campaign battle, taking incoming fire from his more progressive rivals running for the nomination while also fielding attacks from President Trump and his Republican allies.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

In explaining the reversal on accepting outside support from super PACs – which under law are allowed to accept unlimited donations but prevented from coordinating or having any contact with the candidates and their campaigns - deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield noted that “we will see more than a billion dollars in spending by Trump and his allies to re-elect this corrupt president. And let's be clear: Donald Trump has decided that the general election has already begun.”

""In this time of crisis in our politics, it is not surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law to bring an end to his disastrous presidency,"" Bedingfield added. ""Nothing changes unless we defeat Donald Trump.""

Democratic consultant and fundraiser Larry Rasky, who worked on Biden's 1988 and 2008 presidential bids, is one of the ringleaders of the soon to be formed super PAC.

“We intend to fight back against the lies and distortions we’re seeing now from Trump, his allies, the Russians, and the Republican Party,” Rasky said on Thursday.

“While other candidates have groups supporting their efforts, no other Democrat has to fight this two-front war. We know Joe Biden is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump – and so does Donald Trump. That is why our friend Joe Biden is the target and why we will have his back,” he emphasized.

Big bucks and dark money in politics has become a major issue in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, with most of the candidates swearing off super PACs.

Sanders, campaigning in Iowa on Friday, told reporters “I do not think a super PAC is healthy for American democracy.”

His campaign was less diplomatic, saying a day earlier that “the former Vice President has been unable to generate grassroots support, and now his campaign is endorsing an effort to buy the primary through a super PAC that can rake in unlimited cash from billionaires and corporations.""

And Warren tweeted on Thursday night that it’s “disappointing that any Democratic candidate would reverse course and endorse the use of unlimited contributions from the wealthy to run against fellow Democrats. A handful of wealthy donors should not be allowed to buy the Democratic nomination. That's not who we are.""

Bedingfield, in explaining the Biden campaign’s reversal on super PACs, spotlighted that as president, Biden will “push to remove private money from our federal elections,” including through a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United to “end the era of unbridled spending by Super PACs.”

For Biden and the other top-tier contenders hoping to face off against Trump in next year’s general election, a huge challenge lays ahead.

YANG SAYS HE WON'T DISSUADE SUPER PAC SUPPORT

“Each of these candidates is facing a possibly billion-dollar challenge in the general election against an incumbent who has been fundraising for reelection since he took his oath of office. That necessitates real choices about how to compete,” Barnes noted. “I think we will see all the front runners decide how to tackle that possibility through their values and their individual capabilities. For Biden, that’s a more conventional, establishment approach rather than harnessing a massive grassroots movement.”

Biden wasn’t the only White House hopeful making news week regarding outside fundraising support. Democratic presidential candidate and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang made headlines when he said he wouldn’t try to dissuade a new super PAC – called the Math PAC – which has vowed to raise and spend at least $1 million in support of Yang’s campaign.

Yang told Fox News and CBS News “I'm not going to try and dissuade them, because we have the rules that we have. After I'm president, I'm very happy to repeal Citizens United and try and do away with super PACs entirely. But given the rules that we have right now, my goal is to compete and to win and so I'm not going to dissuade private citizens from trying to help.”

Warren has been asked for an explanation 17 times on the campaign trail, ""America's Newsroom"" host Sandra Smith noted, including at a debate last week.

On the debate stage last week, Warren faced biting criticism from some of her rivals, including Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, who accused her of being dishonest about the plan's costs.

Accusing Warren of being evasive, Buttigieg argued that “your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything— except for this.

BIDEN, FACING CASH CRUNCH, FLIPS ON SUPER PAC SPENDING

NYT: “Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign effectively dropped its longstanding opposition to receiving the assistance of super PACs on Thursday, opening the door for wealthy supporters to spend unlimited amounts of money to try and lift him in the Democratic primary. The move represents a stark reversal and an implicit acknowledgment of his weakened position in the contest. He entered October with only $9 million in the bank, a fraction of his leading rivals. … As recently as a month ago, when a possible pro-Biden super PAC surfaced, his campaign denounced the effort. But on Thursday, Kate Bedingfield, his deputy campaign manager, softened that stance… ‘Let’s be clear: Donald Trump has decided that the general election has already begun,’ Ms. Bedingfield said. ‘He and his allies are already spending massive amounts of money on paid television and digital advertising to intervene directly in Democratic primaries with the goal of preventing Joe Biden, the opponent that Trump fears most, from becoming the Democratic nominee.’”



Biden still leads in Warren two-to-one in South Carolina - Fox News: “Joe Biden remains the clear front-runner in the latest poll in South Carolina – which holds the first southern primary in the race for the White House. But the former vice president’s lead is taking a hit as top-tier rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s support soars in the contest the Biden campaign sees as a firewall. Biden – who has longstanding ties in the state – stands at 33 percent among South Carolina voters likely to cast a ballot in the state’s February primary, according to a new poll from Monmouth University. That’s down 6 percentage points from Monmouth’s previous survey in the Palmetto State, which was conducted in July. Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, stands at 16 percent in the survey, a jump of 7 points from July. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is in third in the new poll, at 12 percent.”



Dems nudge debate threshold to 4 percent for December - Politico: “New thresholds announced by the Democratic National Committee for the sixth debate — which will be hosted by POLITICO and PBS on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles — represent only a modest step up from the criteria for the next debate in November. But they could still seriously endanger the participation of all but the top five candidates… To make the December debate, candidates must hit 4 percent support in at least four DNC-approved polls of primary voters nationally or in early-voting states (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina) — or, instead, they can qualify by hitting 6 percent in two approved early-state polls. Candidates must also bring in donations from 200,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 800 donors in 20 states, territories or the District of Columbia.”



Bernie’s small-donor numbers padded by repeat contributions - WSJ: “The February day that Bernie Sanders began his second Democratic presidential campaign, Christine Peloza gave him $27, the amount Mr. Sanders often boasted was the average donation in his first run. Then, she kept giving, in $3 increments, clicking donate up to 20 times a day. By the end of June, Ms. Peloza, a 34-year-old office manager at an elderly care facility in Illinois, had donated more than 850 times to Mr. Sanders… The Sanders campaign laid claim to the majority of these ‘super donors,’ the Journal found, with about 1,000 of them. The other Democrats in the race combined for at least 650 ultra-repeat givers, led by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who had at least 125. And President Trump’s re-election campaign, which began in 2017, has at least 250.”



Gabbard, facing dimming House hopes, drops re-election bid - Reuters: “Tulsi Gabbard, the last House member still in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, said Thursday she would not seek reelection for her Hawaii seat. ‘I believe I can best serve the people of Hawaii and our country as your President and Commander-in-Chief,’ she said in an announcement posted on Twitter. Gabbard’s decision clears the way for Hawaii State Senator Kai Kahele, who announced a primary challenge against her this spring. ‘I wholly respect and appreciate Congresswoman Gabbard’s decision not to pursue re-election for her Congressional seat as she pursues the Presidency,’ Kahele said in a tweet.”



THE RULEBOOK: GUT CHECK

“Let us now pause and ask ourselves whether, in the course of these papers, the proposed Constitution has not been satisfactorily vindicated from the aspersions thrown upon it; and whether it has not been shown to be worthy of the public approbation, and necessary to the public safety and prosperity.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 85



TIME OUT: LASTING LEGACY

WAMU: “There have been several stories recently highlighting the last time a Washington baseball team won a World Series. The answer most given is the Senators in 1924. Now, it’s true that the Senators were Washington’s last major league baseball team to win a World Series. But there was another very successful team to come afterward. The Homestead Grays won three Negro League World Series titles. … Now, there are plenty of reasons why baseball enthusiasts would disagree with this argument. They might say that the Grays were not exclusively a Washington team. They were founded in Pittsburgh in 1912 and didn’t start splitting time until 1940. … Like many Negro League teams, the Homestead Grays did not have a dedicated field. … Washington Senators owner Clark Griffith saw a financial benefit to letting the Grays play some of their games at his stadium in D.C.… Thus, the team became the Washington Homestead Grays.”

IMPEACHMENT WOES FOR SWING STATE GOP SENATORS

NYT: “Senate Republicans facing steep re-election races next year know the impeachment inquiry coursing steadily ahead on the other side of the Capitol will determine President Trump’s political fate. Their growing fear is that it will also determine their own. In a matter of weeks, those few senators have watched helplessly as the investigation by House Democrats has lobbed a grenade into the middle of their campaigns, putting them on the defensive amid a torrent of damaging revelations about the president’s conduct with no clear end in sight. It has tightened the squeeze they were already feeling between a political base that demands unquestioning loyalty to Mr. Trump, and the moderate swing voters who may very well decide their elections. And it is one reason that support for the president in the Republican-led Senate appears to be subtly softening, a phenomenon that some of his own advisers fear that Mr. Trump does not fully appreciate.”



Big bucks for Trump re-elect not trickling down to Senate runs - RCP: “President Donald Trump is raising record amounts of cash for his 2020 reelection. But that fundraising might isn’t spilling over to the most vulnerable Republicans fighting to hold onto their seats in a narrowly divided Senate. During the third quarter, former astronaut Mark Kelly took in $2.5 million more than Republican Sen. Martha McSally in Arizona. In Maine, state House Speaker Sara Gideon bested longtime Republican Sen. Susan Collins by over $1 million. And in Colorado, Cory Gardner, who led Senate Republicans’ campaign arm in 2018, barely outraised former Gov. John Hickenlooper, who had been in the race just five weeks before the quarter ended. The trouble for Republicans extends to states where they’re supposed to be on firmer ground. Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst didn’t crack $1 million and was outraised by the leading Democrat. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis narrowly outraised Democrat Cal Cunningham…”



OBAMA ON CUMMINGS: BEING STRONG MEANS BEING KIND

ABC News: “The funeral for Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings took place in his hometown of Baltimore Friday morning. ‘Elijah Cummings came from good soil,’ former President Barack Obama said in his eulogy. ‘A leader who once said he’d die for his people even as he lived every minute for them. His life validates the things we tell ourselves about what’s possible in this country -- not guaranteed, but possible.’ Obama went on to say that while hearing Cummings’ daughters speak at the funeral, ‘I was thinking I’d want my daughters to know how much I love them, but I’d also want them to know that being a strong man also means being kind, that there’s nothing weak about kindness and compassion. There’s nothing weak about looking out for others. There’s nothing weak about being honorable. You’re not a sucker to have integrity and to treat others with respect.’”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Per your response to a question From the Bleachers in [Thursday’s] Report, Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution provides that conviction post-impeachment can result in permanent disqualification from any federal office. My recollection is that this is an issue apart from mere conviction/removal—an additional punishment the Senate may, but need not confer. Apart from that, I suppose technically anyone can RUN for President, but if subsequent to conviction and with this disqualification applied, s/he would, if somehow elected, be legally barred from actually taking office. Love your Reports, and your appearances on FNC!” – Doug Chamberlain, Hooksett, N.H.



[Ed. note: Quite right you are. The Senate could apply that further sanction. I should have been clear on that point! Thank you for pointing it out.]



“Most batches or degrees do not prepare the recipient to do anything except further education. Taxpayer tuition is for the schools/universities, not students. Maybe ‘free’ tuition for a trade school would benefit the student and the community. I have two graduate degrees and have taught college level courses.” – Jim Fullilove, Shreveport, La.



[Ed. note: America has a most distressing educational problem. College graduation rates continue to rise while high-school graduation rates continue to fall. This is a reflection of a society in which a broad elite – maybe 30 percent of the country – sees increasingly better outcomes, while the remainder is falling farther behind. It strikes me that the important work ought to be done in improving secondary education before we just punt the problem into additional years of universal education.]



“What were you thinking when you included the beloved microwave burrito along with antiquities like Fireball shots or skinny jeans? To this day, I – who travel the roads often for business – can almost always find my comfort food, the microwave burrito, at any hour at any convenience store. It is the perfect culinary treat, containing every food group, … and prepared ‘fresh’ in an aged microwave found buried at the back of the store with pre-set numbered times - as to which you must simply guess. The cheese, beans and other contents are irregularly heated in wonderful patches, and the corners of the flour tortilla without moisture become perfectly crunchy (or just hard). The last salty savory bite from the bottom of the slightly melted plastic wrapper is like the last Oreo in a pack, and it compels you to wonder how much longer to the next highway exit or rest stop, where you might consider getting just one more. Comparing this oasis treat with unproductive party primaries and anti-constitutional, anti-‘democratic republic’ zanies is just wrong.” – Ken Levine, Lionville, Pa.



[Ed. note: Mr. Levine, you are a balm to a weary mind! But what you need, sir, are pepperoni rolls. On your next sojourn southwest, hang a left at Harrisburg down to Interstate 68 and ride down to North Central West Virginia. Buy a large bag – Country Club Bakery, if possible and under no circumstances with cheese – and toss them in your passenger seat. They are the ideal companion for long drives.]

MAYBE TRY FROOT LOOPS AFTER YOUR NEXT COMMUTE

UPI: “Researchers in Virginia said they trained rats to drive tiny cars and learned the activity was a means of stress relief for the rodents. The scientists at the University of Richmond's Lambert Behavioral Neuroscience Laboratory said they trained two groups of rats to operate the ‘rat-operated vehicle,’ or ROV, which works by having the rats push down on a copper bar that propels the tiny car forward. The rats were rewarded with Froot Loops cereal when they drove to the end of the enclosure. Kelly Lambert, head of the laboratory and lead author of the story … said researchers analyzed the rats' droppings and found both groups of rodents had an increase in hormones that control stress responses. … Lambert said the study could have implications for how researchers approach depression and other mental illnesses in humans.”

And the thresholds for the White House contenders to make the debate stage are once again rising.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

The Democratic National Committee on Friday announced that the debate will be held on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs. The DNC said that PBS NewsHour and Politico will co-host the showdown.

The debate will be the first held on the West Coast, and specifically California. The Golden State is playing a larger role this cycle in determining the Democratic presidential nominee. California moved up the date of its primary and will be the largest of the 15 states scheduled to vote on Super Tuesday, which will be held on March 3 of next year.

To make the cut for the Dec. 19 debate, candidates must now receive at least 4 percent support in at least four qualifying national polls or surveys in the early primary and caucus states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina – or hit at least 6 percent in two qualifying polls in the early voting states. Only polls released between Oct. 16 and Dec. 12 will be considered.

The DNC is also upping the fundraising threshold. Candidates will now have to hit campaign contributions from at least 200,000 individual donors – with a minimum of 800 unique contributors in at least 20 states or the District of Columbia.

The candidates have until Dec. 12 – one week before the debate – to hit the fundraising and polling criteria.

SOME 2020 DEMS FUME OVER DNC'S DEBATE CRITERIA

Nine candidates out of the remaining field of roughly 17 Democratic White House contenders say they’ve hit the lower thresholds to make the stage for next month’s fifth-round debate, which will be held Nov. 20 in Georgia. They are former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, businessman and progressive advocate Tom Steyer, and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

Three candidates who reached the October debate stage are at risk of not qualifying for the November showdown. They are Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro of Texas, and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, also of Texas.

The DNC’s qualifying criteria have been repeatedly criticized by many of the middle- and lower-tier candidates for months. Activists also argue that the job of narrowing the field belongs to the voters in the early-voting states rather than with national party leaders.

Pushing back against the criticism, DNC Chairman Tom Perez told Fox News in September that the process has been “eminently fair” and added “we’re going “to continue to be transparent.”"

There are new opportunities for some second-tier candidates – especially South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

Both Buttigieg and Klobuchar used this month’s televised debate to hone their appeal to the moderate wing of the Democratic Party – directly by attacking Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s liberal policy proposals (especially “Medicare-for-all”) and implicitly by being younger than former Vice President Joe Biden.

Going into the debate, the emerging conventional wisdom appeared to be that – for all the energy of over 20 starting candidates – the race was quickly turning into a two-person contest between Warren and Biden.

FORMER HILLARY ADVISER REFUSES TO RULE OUT HILLARY RUNNING IN 2020 -- IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE RIGHT

Warren was running a pitch-perfect effort and consolidating the support of the liberal wing of the party, which seeks fundamental change in the U.S. economic system.

Biden was riding a tide of polling that suggested he would be the strongest general election candidate. He was appealing to a party electorate whose anger at President Trump motivates many of them to care primarily about who has the best chance of achieving their top objective: defeating Trump.

But now folks are realizing the historical truism of the nominating process: It starts in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – and results there can often depart from national polling and have an impact on subsequent contests.

The first three contests rely more on in-state retail politics than on national support, and the one-state nature of each contest enables more-focused media campaigns.

The truism comes out in the polling. In the RealClear Politics averages, Buttigieg currently garners roughly twice as much support in Iowa and New Hampshire as he does nationally.

By contrast, Biden does slightly worse in those states than he’s doing nationally, while the other two leading candidates – Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont – run basically in line with their national performance.

The most recent USA Today Poll showed the leading “candidate” – at 29 percent – is “Undecided,” scoring over 10 points ahead of supposed front-runners Biden and Warren.

Other lower-tier candidates may also benefit from the one-state focus of the first three contests.

Klobuchar, from neighboring Minnesota, is mounting a full-court press in Iowa, vowing to visit all 99 counties. She is shuttling between there and New Hampshire.

But it’s not just Midwestern moderates Buttigieg and Klobuchar who are making strong bids in the early states.

Even novelty candidates – like Andrew Yang, who cleverly uses social media to lead his #YangGang, and self-funding billionaire Tom Steyer – are able to make a push in the smaller early states.

Steyer, though he has yet to articulate a real rationale for his candidacy, is funding enormous media buys in the early states – and as a result is registering 2 or 3 percent in polling there, while barely garnering 1 percent support nationally.

But in a wide-open, in-state race, it is even possible that some of the third-tier, but more traditional candidates – such as Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California and Michael Bennet of Colorado, or Montana Gov. Steve Bullock – might figure out a way to break through or reanimate their fading campaigns.

Still, the three currently leading candidates – Biden, Warren and Sanders – retain the best chance of winning the nomination, even though the race has opened up, and they’re facing clear headwinds.

Warren has run into challenges from two sources. She’d been hoping that Sanders – currently third and, since May, consistently running at around 16 percent in national polls – would fade and enable her to consolidate the support of the left wing of the party, but that hasn’t happened.

Despite recent punditry saying Sanders was losing ground, he reported raising the most money of any candidate in the last reporting period, put in a solid debate performance not long after a heart attack, and won the support of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.

The endorsements may not affect the bulk of the Democratic electorate, but show that Sanders still has a solid appeal to a significant segment of the left-wing of the Democratic Party.

While Warren can turn that lemon into lemonade by saying she’s more moderate than Republicans like to portray her, she ran into other challenges in the debate. She wasn’t able to articulate a good response to questions about whether “Medicare-for-all” will result in higher taxes.

Face it: “Medicare-for-all” will require tax increases, but one can argue that middle-class Americans will pay less with government-funded health insurance than they pay today separately in both taxes and for private health insurance premiums.

Similarly, Biden has run into headwinds despite a political environment that appears tailor-made for him. With an impeachment inquiry surrounding claims that President Trump sought to extort Ukraine to provide dirt against Biden, it ought to be easy for Biden to make the case that he’s the Democrat Trump fears the most.

It also ought to be easy for Biden to inoculate himself against questions of whether he helped his son get a high-paid position on the board of a Ukrainian company, but it hasn’t been. Instead, Biden seems to have trouble getting those questions behind him. Every time I watch Biden, I think: Presidents Reagan, Clinton, or Bush would’ve had enough political jiu-jitsu to turn this Ukraine story into a winner. Why can’t you?

My sense is that the troubles for Warren and Biden are not over. If the two continue to face challenges in consolidating their separate wings of the party, other candidates may soon claim their place in the spotlight, and could catapult themselves into a leading position.

Indeed, there are calls, especially from donors and uncommitted consultants, for others to join the race.

These new candidates include: former first lady Michelle Obama, who evinces zero interest in running; former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has said he might consider running if Biden falters; and presumably former senator, secretary of state and Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry.

Even one of 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s top aides has publicly said that Clinton should think about entering the race.

My own bet is that Clinton, in particular, is unlikely to run, but quite clearly is enjoying her role on Twitter as an ongoing Trump troll, giving her personal vindication.

Bottom line: the most important numbers to watch will be the polling emerging from the three early states. Those will indicate how the race is evolving.

The polling numbers – which span both before and after the most recent debate – show why one should look primarily at the results of the early states, rather than try to just use national numbers to consider how the nomination contest is shaping up.

The state polls suggest that the Democratic race remains open. None of the top candidates appears to be consolidating support – but they’re not fading, either.

The opportunity for significant changes in the character of the race remain.

In a survey released today by Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, Warren maintains a seven-point lead over Joe Biden -- that's the candidate all the people on television assure us will be the Democratic nominee.

Warren is a full 13 points ahead of Bernie Sanders. Now keep in mind that both Warren and Sanders are Northeastern socialists. They're pulling from essentially the same strain of Democratic primary voters. Splitting that vote should dramatically weaken Warren's position in the field, but she is leading anyway. That's how dominant she is.

CHRIS WALLACE: 2020 DEMOCRATS LOOK 'NERVOUS' WHEN BIDEN SPEAKS AT DEBATES

So unless something unforeseen and dramatic happens between now and next spring -- and it could -- but if it doesn't, Elizabeth Warren will be the Democratic nominee. And that, as they say, has implications for all of us. There are her many terrible policy ideas -- Obviously we'll get to those in just a minute, but more immediately, there is Warren herself.

You're going to be seeing a lot of Elizabeth Warren over the next year. She'll be on your television screen nonstop. You will hear her voice rising from your car radio at red lights.

If you live in Iowa, New Hampshire, or South Carolina, you may find her in the flesh, loitering outside your Starbucks or waiting on your doorstep.

Prepare yourself because wherever there is Elizabeth Warren, there is falseness. Fake is who Warren is. She is authentically ersatz.

It turns out that pretending to be an Indian is not the least real thing Warren has ever done. She is always that synthetic, even when she is sitting around the kitchen, as seen in a video she was featured in earlier this year.

Elizabeth Warren: Hold on a sec. I'm going to get me a beer.

Hey, come over, my husband, Bruce, is now in here. You want a beer?

Bruce Mann, Elizabeth Warren's husband: No, I'll pass on the beer for now.

Warren: Let's, I'm going to pull up a stool and sit down.

It's hard to believe that's real. If you could play that again, please.

Warren: Hold on a sec. I'm going to get me a beer.

Hey, my husband, Bruce, is now in here. You want a beer?

Mann: No, I'll pass on the beer for now.

Warren: Let's -- I'm going to pull up a stool and sit down.

""I'll pass on the beer for now,"" says the off-camera figure -- who she says is her husband. It had to be an actor, right? No actual married couple could have an exchange that stilted. They'd have to be reading off cue cards, complete with intentionally bad grammar for that patina of middle-class authenticity.

Wherever there is Elizabeth Warren, there is falseness. Fake is who Warren is.

""I'm going to get me a beer,"" says the Harvard professor. Fetch me my Winston's. I'm hankering for a smoke. You have got to be kidding!

Except Elizabeth Warren isn't kidding. She expects you to believe every word of what she says, which means you're watching someone who will say literally anything. Whatever it takes.

In the primaries on the Democratic side, what it takes is maximum leftward pander. So that's what Warren has delivered this season. There's no issue in which she doesn't have the most radical possible position. And for now, it's working. Quinnipiac confirms that.

But how will Warren's positions on the issues play with the rest of the country in next fall's general election? Let's see.

On immigration, Warren wants to decriminalize all border crossings into this country. If that sounds crazy to you, you are hardly alone. Two-thirds of the country opposes that idea, too.

Warren also says she wants to abolish ICE, that's our federal immigration enforcement agency. How many Americans agree with her on that? Fewer than 25 percent agree with Elizabeth Warren on that.

Under her plan, we'd likely see a huge increase in illegal immigration, of course, and she has told us that every one of those foreign nationals is entitled to completely free health care, courtesy of you. How many Americans approve of that idea? Well, not that many, not surprisingly.

Though more than say they favor race-based reparations. And that's something else that Warren has called for. Sending people tax dollars based on their skin color is a genuinely unpopular idea in this country. But Warren doesn't seem to care.

As she has pointed out before, America is so racist, we deserve it.

Warren: We live in a country now where the president is advancing environmental racism, economic racism, criminal justice, racism, health care racism.

""Health care racism?!"" Hmm. You've got to wonder which bored teaching assistant in what mediocre state university thought up that phrase, ""health care racism"" -- and what it might mean.

Warren didn't bother to define it, of course. In her world, it is self-explanatory. You just add the word racism after any category of public policy, and all the ""woke"" kids nod in unison. ""Oh, health care racism. Yeah, man. It's systemic. This country was built on health care racism."" Of course, it was.

When you're slinging B.S. in such copious volume that even soulless hacks like Chris Matthews and Stephen Colbert wince a little bit when you deliver it, it's a sign. It's not a good sign.

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why we need ""Medicare-for-all."" It's a costly plan to be sure. But it's a plan that Elizabeth Warren -- because she is magic, being infused with the power of her ancestral Cherokee spirit animals -- can pay for without raising taxes on you, or anyone you know, or anyone you will ever meet. She can do that. She swears she can.

Marc Lacey, national editor for the New York Times/Democratic debate moderator: Will you raise taxes on the middle class for pay to pay for it? Yes or no?

Warren: Its costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working, middle-class families, costs will go down.

-----

Warren: Hard-working, middle class families are going to see their costs go down.

Stephen Colbert, host of ""The Late Show"": And all their taxes go up.

Warren: Well, but here's the thing ...

Colbert: But here's the thing, I've listened to these answers a few times before.

----

George Stephanopoulos, ABC News host: Will middle-class taxes go up? Will private insurance be eliminated?

Warren: What families have to deal with is cost -- total cost. That's what they have to deal with.

----

Warren: How much are your costs going to go down?

Chris Matthews, host of ""Hardball"" on MSNBC: No, no. Different question. How much will your taxes go up?

Warren: No, it's how much are your costs?

Matthews: How --

Warren: It's how much -- it's how much families end up spending.

Matthews: I know that argument, but will you pay more in taxes? But why don't you want to answer that question? Because as Jake said tonight, that's a Republican talking point. It's not a Republican talking point. It's a question.

Warren: It's a question about where people are going to come out economically. Look --

Matthews: No, that's not my question.

Warren: I spent -- I spent ...

Ouch. When you're slinging B.S. in such copious volume that even soulless hacks like Chris Matthews and Stephen Colbert wince a little bit when you deliver it, it's a sign. It's not a good sign.

The New York Times has not endorsed a Republican for president since 1956. Prior to the Mueller report, the influential paper published story after story about alleged Russian collusion with the Trump presidential campaign.

Project Veritas, the investigative reporting outfit that uses undercover video, recorded CNN employees complaining about the cable news organization's anti-Trump agenda. On one video, a voice, identified as CNN president and CEO Jeff Zucker, can be heard all but instructing his staffers to focus on impeachment, to the exclusion of what taped staffers say they considered other important news.

""There's a lot of people out here just trying to do what they think is the best of journalistic integrity,"" said one CNN staffer. ""Then you get on the 9 a.m. call and big boss Jeff Zucker f----ing tells you what to do.""

So if viewers assumed the debate moderators' questions wouldn't be tough, they weren't disappointed. Here are just 10 questions that were not asked:

GUTFELD ON THE TRUMP OBSESSION AT THE DEBATE

1. About the Trump tax cuts, Democrats like Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., claim that 83 percent of the benefits would go to ""the top 1 percent, richest people in this country, and the most powerful corporations."" But the Washington Post fact-checker said: ""The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that initially more than 80 percent of taxpayers would get a tax cut, with less than 5 percent getting a tax increase."" Why, then, do you keep restating what The Washington Post said isn't true?

2. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, for years, you've said, ""We are now spending twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country."" And for years, PolitiFact has said that's false. So why do you keep saying it?

3. Many of you support reparations, but former President Obama said, ""Children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime, nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison."" Isn't family breakdown a far bigger problem than a need for reparations?

4. In 1900, government at all three levels -- state, local and federal -- took less than 10 percent of Americans' income. Today, government takes close to 31 percent. How much more income should government take from the American people?

5. In 2017, nearly 40,000 Americans were murdered or committed suicide by firearms, so you've demanded that Congress pass ""commonsense gun control laws"" to save lives. But how many Americans are alive each year because they used firearms in self-defense?

6. Some of you have proposed a ""buyback"" of AR-15s and other ""weapons of war."" In 2018, according to the FBI, there were 297 people killed by rifles -- all rifles, not just AR-15s. But 443 people were killed by hammers, clubs and other blunt objects. And 672 were killed by ""fists, feet and other 'personal weapons.'"" Gun rights advocates argue that these numbers show you have lost perspective. Please comment.

7. You criticize President Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria. But when President Obama withdrew troops from Iraq, Democrats supported the policy -- even though it ran counter to the advice Obama got from his national security team. The withdrawal allowed ISIS to grow and metastasize. Obama sent back about 4,000 troops, and the troop level remains about 5,000. Is it not hypocritical to criticize Trump for doing the same thing that Democrats applauded Obama for?

8. Does President Trump deserve any credit for an economy that's producing rising incomes and record-low unemployment for blacks and Hispanics?

9. Rep. Beto O'Rourke, you say you've benefited from ""white privilege"" and that America is built on ""endemic"" and ""foundational"" racism. On the stage with you are New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, of African descent; Andrew Yang, of Chinese descent; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who is Samoan American; and California Sen. Kamala Harris, whose background is Jamaican and Indian. Why didn't ""endemic"" and ""foundational"" racism prevent these candidates of color from being on the same stage with you, on the same night, competing for the same job?

10. About Charlottesville, where a woman was killed by a white nationalist, you claim President Trump said there were good white nationalists and good neo-Nazis on ""both sides."" In fact, at that very same press conference, Trump said, ""I'm not talking about the white nationalists and the neo-Nazis -- because they should be condemned totally."" Why do you keep misquoting the president?

Compared to previous Democratic debates, this recent three-hour long one aired on CNN rated pretty bad. Who knows? A tough question or two might have generated a bit more interest.

Is 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton seriously mulling a third stab for the White House?

Clinton’s own comments and actions in recent weeks sparked the Washington buzz, fueling stories that she could possibly enter her party’s nomination race at this late date amid complaints from some Democratic Party insiders who view the current field of contenders too weak or progressive to take on President Trump next year.

LONGTIME HILLARY CLINTON ADVISER REFUSES TO RULE OUT A CLINTON 2020 BID

Clinton even indirectly took aim at Trump on Friday during the nationally televised memorial service for the late Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, who has vocally clashed with the president.

Comparing Cummings to the prophet Elijah, Clinton said to loud applause that “like that Old Testament prophet, he stood against corrupt leadership of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel.""

Longtime top Clinton adviser Philippe Reines also fueled the flames, saying in interviews this week with Fox News’ Tucker Carlson and Dana Perino that his old boss had not closed the door on a 2020 bid.

He told Carlson Clinton hasn't closed the door to running, saying she would ""think about it long and hard"" if she thought she had the best odds of beating Trump — while still calling the scenario unlikely.

“I think it’s somewhere between highly unlikely and zero but it’s not zero. I don’t know how to be more honest than that,” Reines said Thursday on Fox News' ‘Daily Briefing with Dana Perino.’

“To the extent that I talk to her about the race and just in general what she’s up to, I do think she’s been looking and watching wistfully, which is totally understandable given the race she went through in 2016,” Reines said.

The former first lady, senator from New York and secretary of state, and the first major-party female presidential nominee, has essentially remained in the spotlight ever since losing the 2016 election to Trump — yet winning the national popular vote.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL RACE

But her comments and actions in recent weeks have elevated her relevance in the 2020 campaign to a new level, renewing questions about her role in the race for the White House and sparking some speculation that she still has presidential ambitions despite past claims to the contrary.

The latest episodes include Clinton tweeting “Don’t tempt me” in response to Trump's suggestion about running in 2020; mocking Trump’s interactions with foreign leaders; and arguing without evidence that Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii is a “Russian asset” — a swipe that injected her into the 2020 primary battle, even from the sidelines.

A top aide downplayed the 2020 speculation, however.

“The short of it is that she’s on a book tour and is feeling unconstrained about speaking her mind,” longtime Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told Fox News earlier this week. “It’s easy to over-ascribe a strategy about every word she utters, but it’s as simple as that. She’s out there telling the truth.”

CLINTON MULLING WHITE HOUSE BID, CITING WEAK FIELD, ACCORDING TO REPORTS

But the story went viral on Tuesday, with a New York Times report that Clinton in recent weeks stated she would declare her candidacy if she were certain she would win the race.

The article, headlined “Anxious Democratic Establishment Asks, ‘Is There Anybody Else?’,” noted that about a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered in New York City raised concerns whether former Vice President Joe Biden – a co-front-runner – could stand strong against Trump, and worried about his fundraising struggles and the need to defend his son Hunter Biden over business dealings in Ukraine amid the House impeachment inquiry into the president. Those gathered also said Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders were likely too liberal to win the general election.

An adviser close to the Biden world, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, said the former vice president’s camp is not taking the media reports seriously and they continue to “move ahead.”

And in the crucial first primary state of New Hampshire, a top Democrat says concern with the field and a hunger for another candidate is not a topic of conversation that she's heard.

“I’ve heard nothing about people wishing someone else would get into the race,” said Kathy Sullivan, a longtime Democratic National Committee member and former New Hampshire Democratic party chair.

Sullivan, who backed Clinton in the 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns, told Fox News, “I’m not taking this seriously. I love Hillary Clinton and I think she’d be a fantastic president but there is a lot of really good people running for president right now. I think it’s too late in the day for someone to get into the race. I don’t take it seriously and I don’t think it’s a good idea and we don’t need to have anyone else in the race right now.”

It is getting late in the game, especially in New Hampshire, where Nov. 15 is the last day for a candidate to file to get their name on the first-in-the-nation presidential primary ballot.

And a longtime Democratic veteran of over 10 New Hampshire primaries noted that “we’ve seen this before. It’s not an uncommon Democratic trait to long for someone who is not in the race. It’s like pre-buyer’s remorse. Shopper's remorse.”

“Why so much anonymity? If they actually have a valid case, you’d think they could put their name to it,” Devine told ""The Daily Briefing with Dana Perino"" on Friday.

“If you work for a president, if you feel so strongly that their policies are against your principles, then you should quit and then you can write your book and you can do it publicly; not anonymously,” Devine said.

Devine's comments come as the anonymous White House official behind the explosive ""resistance"" op-ed in The New York Times last year returned to the spotlight after it was announced the unknown author will release a book billed as an ""unprecedented behind-the-scenes portrait of the Trump presidency.""

ANONYMOUS OFFICIAL BEHIND INFAMOUS NYT OP-ED TO RELEASE BOOK ON TRUMP WHITE HOUSE

The book, titled “A Warning,” comes roughly a year after the senior official laid out their initial scathing attack on the administration.

According to the publisher, the book will be released Nov. 19 and is said to pick up where the controversial op-ed left off.

""This explosive book offers a shocking, firsthand account of President Trump and his record,"" the publisher said on Tuesday.

Javelin's Matt Latimer and Keith Urbahn, both of whom represented former FBI Director James Comey and his 2018 book, ""A Higher Loyalty,"" are working with the author, whose identity is unknown to the public.

WH OFFICIAL PENS ANONYMOUS NY TIMES OP-ED CALLING TRUMP 'ANTI-DEMOCRATIC,' 'PETTY AND INEFFECTIVE'

The anonymous author's initial op-ed prompted intense media coverage and vehement denunciations from the White House.

Then-White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders blasted the author's cowardice and called on them to resign.

It's unclear whether the official is still in the administration, but the book's release was the latest indication that Trump faced concerted opposition from within his own ranks.

This should be an enlightening moment for all American women – Democrats, Republicans and independents.

We have seen it before. Republican women like former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, presidential primary candidates Carly Fiorina and Rep. Michele Bachmann, and Trump White House officials Sarah Sanders and Kellyanne Conway have been targeted by other women for shocking attacks.

LESLIE MARSHALL: HILLARY CLINTON-TULSI GABBARD FEUD IS A GIFT TO TRUMP – IT NEEDS TO END NOW

But now we see the contagion has spread. If Clinton – a woman who has been a first lady, senator, secretary of state, and presidential nominee – can viciously attack a woman of the same political party who has followed her lead and is running for president, we know no one is safe.

Get ready for the 2024 elections. Former South Carolina Gov. and U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley – or any other woman brave enough to run for president – will be savaged by other women with accusations of betrayal, incompetence and malfeasance.

What has become clear is that if a woman is not in lockstep with Clinton and the establishment Democrats, they will oil her ladder to the final glass ceiling.

The accusation that Gabbard – who represents Hawaii in the U.S. House and has been decorated for her service in the Army National Guard – could be working for a hostile foreign power should not be taken seriously.

So what on Earth has Gabbard done to attract Clinton’s scorn?

Perhaps Gabbard was attacked because while she says she is pro-choice she holds a marginally more nuanced view on abortion than Clinton.

Or perhaps Gabbard was attacked because she openly declares her love for our country, which undermines the leftist narrative that America is inherently evil and should be fundamentally transformed.

I don’t support Gabbard. But her treatment by the Clinton Machine should be called out.

Of course, the leftist media wants in on the fun. They have a long history of unjustly attacking women who disagree with them on issues, while not going after women more sympathetic to their views.

For example, feminist Tina Fey was eager to portray Sarah Palin on “Saturday Night Live” as a mindless puppet of the Republican Party. When Fey said “I can see Russia from my house” – in her role portraying Palin – the media practically treated the line as if Palin had actually said those words (she never did).

There has yet to be a similarly caustic depiction of far-left Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., on “SNL.”

Instead, we have a very public transformation by Clinton into the character Regina George, the female antagonist who torments anyone who doesn’t conform to her standards, brought to life in Fey’s “Mean Girls,” a film whose purpose was to push sisterly bonds of feminism.

Hollywood loves to pile on. After Trump was elected, Madonna chimed in by saying that “it feels like women betrayed us.”

In 2016, Democrats asked women to elect Hillary Clinton as the first woman president. If Clinton supporters were met by any reluctance – including on issues of policy from both their own base or by Republicans – they quoted former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who said: “There’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other.”

However, this sisterly solidarity was ignored in 2018, when feminists offered no assistance to Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn when she successfully campaigned to become the first woman senator from Tennessee.

Rather than support Blackburn, the feminists campaigned for a 74-year-old man dusted off from the shelf of retirement because they couldn’t bring themselves to support a woman with whom they disagreed on important issues.

Voting on a candidate’s policy positions rather than gender is fair enough and makes sense. But why on Earth should Democrats be surprised when women do the exact same thing when voting for a Republican?

What should worry American women isn’t the feigned surprise when Democrats are confronted with the fact that women have a diverse range of thought. What should worry us is the accusation that those of us whose views include supporting President Trump are either disloyal to our sex or unintelligent and incapable of discerning the “truth” and victims of “internalized misogyny.”

Truthfully, doesn’t the view by some women that other women can’t look at the facts and legitimately come to a different conclusion meet the definition of internalized misogyny? This is the natural consequence of dividing people into identity groups, certainly, but it’s also an unmasking of feminist hypocrisy.

I truly believe the first woman president will be a Republican, and she will get elected running on issues and by casting vision for the nation – not by suggesting we all fall in line and say “I’m With Her.”

SANDERS SLAMS BIDEN REVERSAL ON SUPER PAC SUPPORT

Then-senator Biden struggled to raise campaign cash during his unsuccessful 1988 and 2008 runs for the Democratic presidential nomination. But after serving eight years as vice president, Biden’s fundraising woes in his third White House bid come as a bit of a surprise.

Biden had just under $9 million in his campaign coffers as of October 1, after spending more money than he raised during the July-September fundraising quarter. That’s far less than his top rivals Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who reported $25.7 million cash on hand, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who reported having a whopping $33.7 million in the bank.

Biden raised $15.2 million during the third quarter – far less than the hauls by Sanders and Warren. And he was also topped for a second straight fundraising period by South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

AMID CAMPAIGN CASH WOES, BIDEN CAMPAIGN SAYS THEY HAVE THE MONEY 'TO RUN OUR RACE'

Sanders and Warren raised much of their money online, using grassroots outreach to bring in small-dollar donations.

“Older voters like Joe's don't necessarily play this online small donor game,” the aide tied to the super PAC explained. “And we have to take reality the way we see it, in terms of our donor base, what they're resources are.”

While many of the top donors who have contributed to Biden have maxed out at this point in the race, the new super PAC gives them another avenue to donate to the former vice president.

A Democratic strategist who worked on Biden’s 2008 campaign and Sanders’s 2016 team said that the former vice president’s decision on Thursday to open the door to super PAC support – reversing an earlier ban on support from outside groups – is anything but a sign of strength for the once unrivaled front-runner in the polls.

“It’s definitely a choice that comes in a moment when his financials aren’t competing with Bernie, Warren and Buttigieg. Giving a wink to outside help may alleviate some of that gap, but it’s done as his opponents are putting up huge grassroots numbers, so it’s hard to say that this doesn’t seem reactionary to that,” noted consultant Julia Barnes, who’s currently not working for any presidential campaign.

Biden is fighting a two-front campaign battle, taking incoming fire from his more progressive rivals running for the nomination while also fielding attacks from President Trump and his Republican allies.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

In explaining the reversal on accepting outside support from super PACs – which under law are allowed to accept unlimited donations but prevented from coordinating or having any contact with the candidates and their campaigns - deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield noted that “we will see more than a billion dollars in spending by Trump and his allies to re-elect this corrupt president. And let's be clear: Donald Trump has decided that the general election has already begun.”

""In this time of crisis in our politics, it is not surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law to bring an end to his disastrous presidency,"" Bedingfield added. ""Nothing changes unless we defeat Donald Trump.""

Democratic consultant and fundraiser Larry Rasky, who worked on Biden's 1988 and 2008 presidential bids, is one of the ringleaders of the soon to be formed super PAC.

“We intend to fight back against the lies and distortions we’re seeing now from Trump, his allies, the Russians, and the Republican Party,” Rasky said on Thursday.

“While other candidates have groups supporting their efforts, no other Democrat has to fight this two-front war. We know Joe Biden is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump – and so does Donald Trump. That is why our friend Joe Biden is the target and why we will have his back,” he emphasized.

Big bucks and dark money in politics has become a major issue in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, with most of the candidates swearing off super PACs.

Sanders, campaigning in Iowa on Friday, told reporters “I do not think a super PAC is healthy for American democracy.”

His campaign was less diplomatic, saying a day earlier that “the former Vice President has been unable to generate grassroots support, and now his campaign is endorsing an effort to buy the primary through a super PAC that can rake in unlimited cash from billionaires and corporations.""

And Warren tweeted on Thursday night that it’s “disappointing that any Democratic candidate would reverse course and endorse the use of unlimited contributions from the wealthy to run against fellow Democrats. A handful of wealthy donors should not be allowed to buy the Democratic nomination. That's not who we are.""

Bedingfield, in explaining the Biden campaign’s reversal on super PACs, spotlighted that as president, Biden will “push to remove private money from our federal elections,” including through a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United to “end the era of unbridled spending by Super PACs.”

For Biden and the other top-tier contenders hoping to face off against Trump in next year’s general election, a huge challenge lays ahead.

YANG SAYS HE WON'T DISSUADE SUPER PAC SUPPORT

“Each of these candidates is facing a possibly billion-dollar challenge in the general election against an incumbent who has been fundraising for reelection since he took his oath of office. That necessitates real choices about how to compete,” Barnes noted. “I think we will see all the front runners decide how to tackle that possibility through their values and their individual capabilities. For Biden, that’s a more conventional, establishment approach rather than harnessing a massive grassroots movement.”

Biden wasn’t the only White House hopeful making news week regarding outside fundraising support. Democratic presidential candidate and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang made headlines when he said he wouldn’t try to dissuade a new super PAC – called the Math PAC – which has vowed to raise and spend at least $1 million in support of Yang’s campaign.

Yang told Fox News and CBS News “I'm not going to try and dissuade them, because we have the rules that we have. After I'm president, I'm very happy to repeal Citizens United and try and do away with super PACs entirely. But given the rules that we have right now, my goal is to compete and to win and so I'm not going to dissuade private citizens from trying to help.”

Elizabeth Warren promised to release her plan to pay for ""Medicare-for-all.""

Throughout her campaign, Warren has come under fire for refusing to say whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to fund her health care plan. Many of her fellow Democrats — including ""Medicare-for-all"" architect Bernie Sanders — have made clear that the plan would require tax hikes for everyone.

But Warren isn't just dodging the tax question. Like all ""Medicare-for-all"" supporters, she's misleading the public about the damage her plan would do to the finances and health of every American.

ARNON MISHKIN: DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL RACE HEATING UP – BIDEN, WARREN AREN'T ONLY CANDIDATES WHO COULD WIN

Even ""Medicare-for-all"" supporters acknowledge it would be pricey. A new report from the left-leaning Urban Institute predicts the plan would cost $34 trillion over its first decade. Sanders has said that it could cost up to $40 trillion over 10 years.

That's more than the cost of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security combined.

Warren claims she can finance ""Medicare-for-all"" by taxing the rich. But aggressively taxing wealthy individuals and corporations would only generate enough revenue to cover 40 percent of the cost of ""Medicare-for-all,"" according to a new study by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

That's why Sanders has floated a number of new taxes on almost every single American, including a 4 percent tax on each household and a 7.5 percent payroll tax. Sanders claims Americans would pay less for health care under ""Medicare-for-all"" than they currently do, even taking into account their higher tax burden. Warren has promised something similar — that ""Medicare-for-all"" would ""lower costs for middle-class families.""

According to an analysis by an Emory University professor, 70 percent of working, privately insured Americans would pay more for health insurance under a single-payer, ""Medicare-for-all"" system than they do today.

But the evidence suggests otherwise. According to an analysis by Emory University professor Kenneth E. Thorpe, 70 percent of working, privately insured Americans would pay more for health insurance under a single-payer, ""Medicare-for-all"" system than they do today.

They'd face even higher taxes if ""Medicare-for-all"" wound up costing more than projected. It wouldn't be the first time budget experts underestimated the cost of a government insurance program. In 1967, the House Ways and Means Committee predicted that the newly created Medicare program would cost around $12 billion by 1990.

Medicare spending actually reached $110 billion in 1990.

""Medicare-for-all"" advocates claim that the focus on its cost to the federal government is disingenuous. We're already spending well over $3 trillion a year on health care. The Warren/Sanders plan would relieve individuals and employers of that spending — and re-apportion it to the federal government.

Sanders and his allies like to cite a study from the libertarian Mercatus Center, which assumes that ""Medicare-for-all"" will adopt the existing Medicare program's low payment rates — and thus save the country $2 trillion over a decade.

Of course, extending Medicare's payment schedule across the entire health care system would reduce payments to doctors and hospitals by 40 percent, relative to private insurance. And it would raise demand for care by 11 percent.

In other words, ""Medicare-for-all"" posits that doctors and hospitals will have no qualms about treating more patients for less money.

It's more likely that doctors and hospitals will respond to lower payment rates by reducing the supply of care they're willing to deliver. Americans would find themselves in the same position as patients in the United Kingdom's government-run National Health Service, where more than 4 million are currently waiting for care.

Those Britons pay an awful lot to wait in line. The average household in the United Kingdom pays over £5,000 in taxes each year just for health insurance. That's an increase of 75 percent since 2000. And it's likely to rise further. Two British think tanks predict that each British household will have to pay an additional £2,000 per year to keep the NHS running as the population ages.

The American people are unlikely to reward politicians who raise their taxes by thousands of dollars — and then tell them to get in line for health care. Perhaps that's why Warren has been uncharacteristically mum on her plan for paying for ""Medicare-for-all.""

There are new opportunities for some second-tier candidates – especially South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

Both Buttigieg and Klobuchar used this month’s televised debate to hone their appeal to the moderate wing of the Democratic Party – directly by attacking Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s liberal policy proposals (especially “Medicare-for-all”) and implicitly by being younger than former Vice President Joe Biden.

Going into the debate, the emerging conventional wisdom appeared to be that – for all the energy of over 20 starting candidates – the race was quickly turning into a two-person contest between Warren and Biden.

FORMER HILLARY ADVISER REFUSES TO RULE OUT HILLARY RUNNING IN 2020 -- IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE RIGHT

Warren was running a pitch-perfect effort and consolidating the support of the liberal wing of the party, which seeks fundamental change in the U.S. economic system.

Biden was riding a tide of polling that suggested he would be the strongest general election candidate. He was appealing to a party electorate whose anger at President Trump motivates many of them to care primarily about who has the best chance of achieving their top objective: defeating Trump.

But now folks are realizing the historical truism of the nominating process: It starts in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – and results there can often depart from national polling and have an impact on subsequent contests.

The first three contests rely more on in-state retail politics than on national support, and the one-state nature of each contest enables more-focused media campaigns.

The truism comes out in the polling. In the RealClear Politics averages, Buttigieg currently garners roughly twice as much support in Iowa and New Hampshire as he does nationally.

By contrast, Biden does slightly worse in those states than he’s doing nationally, while the other two leading candidates – Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont – run basically in line with their national performance.

The most recent USA Today Poll showed the leading “candidate” – at 29 percent – is “Undecided,” scoring over 10 points ahead of supposed front-runners Biden and Warren.

Other lower-tier candidates may also benefit from the one-state focus of the first three contests.

Klobuchar, from neighboring Minnesota, is mounting a full-court press in Iowa, vowing to visit all 99 counties. She is shuttling between there and New Hampshire.

But it’s not just Midwestern moderates Buttigieg and Klobuchar who are making strong bids in the early states.

Even novelty candidates – like Andrew Yang, who cleverly uses social media to lead his #YangGang, and self-funding billionaire Tom Steyer – are able to make a push in the smaller early states.

Steyer, though he has yet to articulate a real rationale for his candidacy, is funding enormous media buys in the early states – and as a result is registering 2 or 3 percent in polling there, while barely garnering 1 percent support nationally.

But in a wide-open, in-state race, it is even possible that some of the third-tier, but more traditional candidates – such as Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California and Michael Bennet of Colorado, or Montana Gov. Steve Bullock – might figure out a way to break through or reanimate their fading campaigns.

Still, the three currently leading candidates – Biden, Warren and Sanders – retain the best chance of winning the nomination, even though the race has opened up, and they’re facing clear headwinds.

Warren has run into challenges from two sources. She’d been hoping that Sanders – currently third and, since May, consistently running at around 16 percent in national polls – would fade and enable her to consolidate the support of the left wing of the party, but that hasn’t happened.

Despite recent punditry saying Sanders was losing ground, he reported raising the most money of any candidate in the last reporting period, put in a solid debate performance not long after a heart attack, and won the support of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.

The endorsements may not affect the bulk of the Democratic electorate, but show that Sanders still has a solid appeal to a significant segment of the left-wing of the Democratic Party.

While Warren can turn that lemon into lemonade by saying she’s more moderate than Republicans like to portray her, she ran into other challenges in the debate. She wasn’t able to articulate a good response to questions about whether “Medicare-for-all” will result in higher taxes.

Face it: “Medicare-for-all” will require tax increases, but one can argue that middle-class Americans will pay less with government-funded health insurance than they pay today separately in both taxes and for private health insurance premiums.

Similarly, Biden has run into headwinds despite a political environment that appears tailor-made for him. With an impeachment inquiry surrounding claims that President Trump sought to extort Ukraine to provide dirt against Biden, it ought to be easy for Biden to make the case that he’s the Democrat Trump fears the most.

It also ought to be easy for Biden to inoculate himself against questions of whether he helped his son get a high-paid position on the board of a Ukrainian company, but it hasn’t been. Instead, Biden seems to have trouble getting those questions behind him. Every time I watch Biden, I think: Presidents Reagan, Clinton, or Bush would’ve had enough political jiu-jitsu to turn this Ukraine story into a winner. Why can’t you?

My sense is that the troubles for Warren and Biden are not over. If the two continue to face challenges in consolidating their separate wings of the party, other candidates may soon claim their place in the spotlight, and could catapult themselves into a leading position.

Indeed, there are calls, especially from donors and uncommitted consultants, for others to join the race.

These new candidates include: former first lady Michelle Obama, who evinces zero interest in running; former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has said he might consider running if Biden falters; and presumably former senator, secretary of state and Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry.

Even one of 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s top aides has publicly said that Clinton should think about entering the race.

My own bet is that Clinton, in particular, is unlikely to run, but quite clearly is enjoying her role on Twitter as an ongoing Trump troll, giving her personal vindication.

Bottom line: the most important numbers to watch will be the polling emerging from the three early states. Those will indicate how the race is evolving.

The polling numbers – which span both before and after the most recent debate – show why one should look primarily at the results of the early states, rather than try to just use national numbers to consider how the nomination contest is shaping up.

The state polls suggest that the Democratic race remains open. None of the top candidates appears to be consolidating support – but they’re not fading, either.

The opportunity for significant changes in the character of the race remain.

Relax, there’s at most a little more than five years left in the media’s obsessive quest to impeach Trump. This too shall pass.

First we had journalists hyping an entirely anonymous book by the same author of the entirely anonymous anti-Trump op-ed published by The New York Times in September 2018.

Anti-Trump journalists swallowed this one like a handful of M&Ms handed out to trick-or-treaters.

ANONYMOUS OFFICIAL BEHIND INFAMOUS NYT OP-ED TO RELEASE BOOK ON TRUMP WHITE HOUSE

Are the charges in the op-ed true? Is the book accurate? With the writer hiding his or her identity like someone in the witness protection program, there’s no way of knowing and no way of challenging the writer’s claims.

Then things got even weirder.

“CBS This Morning” journalist Nikole Killion apparently time-traveled to promote her fantasy ticket for the 2020 election. She actually pressed Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., about whether he would pick fellow socialist media magnet Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., as his vice presidential running mate if he becomes the Democratic nominee to run against Trump.

There’s just one problem with this fantasy. The Constitution says the president and vice president must be at least 35 years old, and that means Ocasio-Cortez won’t be old enough to be elected to one of those offices until the 2024 election.

Time travel was all the rage. Politico's senior White House reporter Darren Samuelsohn must have been watching “Avengers: Endgame” for story tips. He took his readers on a time-travel trip to the scariest future he could imagine — in a Politico Magazine story headlined “What If Trump Wins?”

Oh, no, Mr. Bill. Not that!

Samuelsohn actually called his article a trip into “the POLITICO Time Machine.”

As the reporter envisioned it, Trump defeats Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in a close Electoral College battle, after losing the popular vote. “But this mixed verdict has done nothing but further entrench the battle lines of a civil war that has become more than just a metaphor,” Samuelsohn writes ominously.

The fantasy went on to predict that “people have been killed.” Trump orders “troops onto the streets of Washington” and helps secure the 2024 nomination for first daughter Ivanka Trump.

Yes, this hallucination ran on the pages of an alleged news organization and was written by a senior White House reporter. And in case it wasn’t clear enough, the message was: support Trump and you get civil war and tyranny.

Politico, D-D.C., has never been subtle.

But wait, there’s more pre-Halloween hijinks by Trump haters masquerading as journalists.

MSNBC “Morning Joe” host Joe Scarborough decided that just as people wouldn’t admit they supported Trump the first time, “people will be reluctant to admit publicly that they can’t put up with him anymore.” Despite a whole world of liberal media that would sing their praises.

Scarborough based the entire premise that “actually the fear and loathing is rising” on one conversation he had with a man in Florida. So, Florida Man is deciding the world view of an entire TV show.

Of course, this is the same Joe who also claimed a few days ago that Trump had committed massive crimes and it’s “all about failed casinos.” According to Scarborough, Trump “is owned by [Russian President Vladimir] Putin because he’s been laundering money, Russian money for the last 20, 30 years.”

The easiest way to tell Scarborough is lying is he still claims he’s “a conservative.”

Harvard student journalists attacked for practicing journalism

College is where many student journalists learn the basics of their craft — asking knowledgeable people “who, what, where, when, why and how” about the stories they cover – and seeking comment from more than one side.

Harvard Crimson staffers certainly got a lesson in how this works last week. They learned that Harvard leftists are biased idiots every single day.

And what’s worse, the leftists expect their college newspaper to reflect that worldview, such as it is.

The Harvard Crimson has a storied history going back 146 years. But history isn’t the paper’s problem. It has a problem with current events and the unwillingness of campus leftists to accept them.

Harvard leftists held a pro-immigration rally to protest the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE). The Crimson covered the event but had the audacity to ask ICE for a comment, which it didn’t provide.

The lefties were outraged by … journalism. The far-left group that organized the initial protest, Act on a Dream, even launched a petition to stop the Crimson from ever doing journalism again. The petition whined about the paper’s “cultural insensitivity” and demanded the staff “apologize for the harm they inflicted.”

The protesters were upset because they claimed the paper informed on them to The Man. What’s funny is that the paper went out of its way to not do that, waiting until the event was over to ask for the comment it never got.

The paper is standing up to protesters — for now. At least this should provide the student journalists a clear lesson for the future. Leftists demand and usually receive fealty from most professional journalists. So the student journalists might stand up now, but they’ll be expected to bend the knee later on.

The one group it’s OK to hate

There’s one group journalists love to hate: old white guys who are Republicans or conservatives, or maybe both.

That racial double standard was on full display last week when journalists screamed about Trump using the word “lynch” but forgot they hadn’t been bothered by it when Biden and other Democrats used the term during the Clinton impeachment.

But the “neutral” news media really worked itself into an uproar when roughly two dozen Republicans entered a House closed-door impeachment hearing this past week without authorization.

MSNBC’s Donny Deutsch blasted the Republicans to the “Morning Joe” audience. He called them ""those white guys, those middle-aged, boring, nerdy-looking white guys.” (Donny apparently has no mirrors in his home or office.) Picture an outlet mocking the race of congressmen when Democrats staged an anti-gun sit-in on the House floor in 2016.

CNN went even further. Commentator Keith Boykin said the action by Republican House members was reminiscent of the KKK. “This looked like a Klan group assembled outside a jail trying to get the sheriff to let them in so they could deliver justice to somebody who was inside,” he told anchor Jake Tapper. For his part, Tapper responded with the mildest of critiques. “Respectfully, I think the Klan metaphor was a little strong,” he said.

Ya think?

The only bright spot came on CBS when “Late Show” host Stephen Colbert mocked the race of the Republicans as well. Because, at least he was funny. He described the scene, saying, “That is a large herd of white men. By the way, a herd of white men is called a ‘A J. Crew.’ A ‘J. Crew’ of white men.”

In 2019, it’s OK to make fun of people’s race as long as they’re on the right.

The first image, released by the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) in Garching, Germany, combined X-ray images of a neighboring galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud, along with a pair of interacting clusters of galaxies at a distance of about 800 million light-years.

“These first images from our telescope show the true beauty of the hidden universe,” said Peter Predehl, principal investigator of eROSITA, in a statement. “To meet our science goals we needed enough sensitivity to detect the most distant clusters of galaxies in the universe over the whole sky, and resolve them spatially. These first light images show that we can do exactly that, but we can go a lot further.”

HOW TO SPOT A WORMHOLE

According to the MPE, each telescope is equipped with state-of-the-art CCD cameras with superb spectral and timing resolution. “The potential for new discoveries is immense. Now we can start reaping the fruits of more than 10 years of work,” added Predehl.

Another eROSITA image of the A3391/3395 system of clusters of galaxies shows the different processes that lead to the formation of so-called gigantic structures in the universe, according to scientists.

The clusters, which look like large nebulae in the images, actually span tens of millions of light-years across, and contain thousands of galaxies each.

“X-rays give us a unique view of the Universe, hidden in visible light,” said Kirpal Nandra, director of high-energy astrophysics at MPE. “Looking at an apparently normal star, in X-rays we might see an orbiting white dwarf or neutron star in the process of devouring its companion. Visible light shows the structure of a galaxy traced by its stars, but the X-rays are dominated by supermassive black holes growing at their centers.""

Nandra continued: ""And where we see clusters of galaxies with optical telescopes, X-rays reveal the huge reservoirs of gas filling the space between them and tracing out the dark matter structure of the Universe. With its performance demonstrated, we now know that eROSITA will lead to a breakthrough in our understanding of the evolution of the energetic Universe.""

The eROSITA was launched on July 13 as part of the Russian-German Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) space mission and has now entered its target orbit 100 days after launch."

* On a related note, the Kansas City Star ran a rather brutal editorial on Friday, directed at the Republican cabinet secretary: “If Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is running to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, then he should quit his rather important day job and do that. Or if, as he told The Star and The Wichita Eagle in a testy, credulity-straining interview on Thursday, he isn’t even thinking about it, then he should by all means focus on U.S. diplomacy – remember diplomacy? – and stop hanging out here every chance he gets.”

Sanders then summed up by saying that while he would be cautious, people should still do their best to defend their individual rights and keep police officers in line.

“So to answer your question, I would be very cautious if you were my son in terms of dealing with that police officer. But I would also defend my rights, and know my rights, and make sure -- if possible -- that police officer’s camera is on or goes on.”

Sanders’ answer was very different from the one former Vice President Joe Biden gave when a female student asked a similar question at the same event.

“If you were my daughter, you’d be a Caucasian girl and you wouldn’t be pulled over,” Biden said. “But here’s the deal. Here’s the deal, what I tell you is that’s what’s wrong. That is what’s wrong. There is institutional racism that still exists.”"

Elizabeth Warren promised to release her plan to pay for ""Medicare-for-all.""

Throughout her campaign, Warren has come under fire for refusing to say whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to fund her health care plan. Many of her fellow Democrats — including ""Medicare-for-all"" architect Bernie Sanders — have made clear that the plan would require tax hikes for everyone.

But Warren isn't just dodging the tax question. Like all ""Medicare-for-all"" supporters, she's misleading the public about the damage her plan would do to the finances and health of every American.

ARNON MISHKIN: DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL RACE HEATING UP – BIDEN, WARREN AREN'T ONLY CANDIDATES WHO COULD WIN

Even ""Medicare-for-all"" supporters acknowledge it would be pricey. A new report from the left-leaning Urban Institute predicts the plan would cost $34 trillion over its first decade. Sanders has said that it could cost up to $40 trillion over 10 years.

That's more than the cost of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security combined.

Warren claims she can finance ""Medicare-for-all"" by taxing the rich. But aggressively taxing wealthy individuals and corporations would only generate enough revenue to cover 40 percent of the cost of ""Medicare-for-all,"" according to a new study by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

That's why Sanders has floated a number of new taxes on almost every single American, including a 4 percent tax on each household and a 7.5 percent payroll tax. Sanders claims Americans would pay less for health care under ""Medicare-for-all"" than they currently do, even taking into account their higher tax burden. Warren has promised something similar — that ""Medicare-for-all"" would ""lower costs for middle-class families.""

According to an analysis by an Emory University professor, 70 percent of working, privately insured Americans would pay more for health insurance under a single-payer, ""Medicare-for-all"" system than they do today.

But the evidence suggests otherwise. According to an analysis by Emory University professor Kenneth E. Thorpe, 70 percent of working, privately insured Americans would pay more for health insurance under a single-payer, ""Medicare-for-all"" system than they do today.

They'd face even higher taxes if ""Medicare-for-all"" wound up costing more than projected. It wouldn't be the first time budget experts underestimated the cost of a government insurance program. In 1967, the House Ways and Means Committee predicted that the newly created Medicare program would cost around $12 billion by 1990.

Medicare spending actually reached $110 billion in 1990.

""Medicare-for-all"" advocates claim that the focus on its cost to the federal government is disingenuous. We're already spending well over $3 trillion a year on health care. The Warren/Sanders plan would relieve individuals and employers of that spending — and re-apportion it to the federal government.

Sanders and his allies like to cite a study from the libertarian Mercatus Center, which assumes that ""Medicare-for-all"" will adopt the existing Medicare program's low payment rates — and thus save the country $2 trillion over a decade.

Of course, extending Medicare's payment schedule across the entire health care system would reduce payments to doctors and hospitals by 40 percent, relative to private insurance. And it would raise demand for care by 11 percent.

In other words, ""Medicare-for-all"" posits that doctors and hospitals will have no qualms about treating more patients for less money.

It's more likely that doctors and hospitals will respond to lower payment rates by reducing the supply of care they're willing to deliver. Americans would find themselves in the same position as patients in the United Kingdom's government-run National Health Service, where more than 4 million are currently waiting for care.

Those Britons pay an awful lot to wait in line. The average household in the United Kingdom pays over £5,000 in taxes each year just for health insurance. That's an increase of 75 percent since 2000. And it's likely to rise further. Two British think tanks predict that each British household will have to pay an additional £2,000 per year to keep the NHS running as the population ages.

The American people are unlikely to reward politicians who raise their taxes by thousands of dollars — and then tell them to get in line for health care. Perhaps that's why Warren has been uncharacteristically mum on her plan for paying for ""Medicare-for-all.""

WALDEN CALLS QUITS AS GOP RETIREMENT RIPTIDE CONTINUES

Politico: “Rep. Greg Walden, the top Republican on the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, will retire at the end of this Congress, the veteran lawmaker announced Monday. The 62-year-old Walden, who was first elected in 1998, said he was confident he'd win reelection but decided instead to end his congressional career in Jan. 2021. ‘Based on recent polling, strong fundraising, and the backing of my wife and family, I am confident I could earn the support of 2nd District voters for another term.’ … ‘But I also know that for me, the time has come to pursue new challenges and opportunities.’ … The Oregon congressman is the 17th House Republican to announce their retirement this cycle, a sign of how difficult it will be for the GOP to win back the majority in what’s already shaping up as a tough 2020 election.”



California congresswoman resigns amid sex scandal - WaPo: “Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.) on Sunday announced her resignation from Congress amid an ethics inquiry into allegations that she had an intimate relationship with a congressional staff member in her office. ‘It is with a broken heart that today I announce my resignation from Congress,’ Hill wrote in a statement. ‘This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, but I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community, and our country.’ Hill’s spokeswoman said that the resignation is not immediate and that Hill is still deciding on when she will leave office. … Last week, the House Ethics Committee opened an investigation into allegations that Hill was romantically involved with her legislative director, Graham Kelly, a relationship that would violate House ethics rules. … Hill’s announcement comes ahead of an early filing deadline for the seat — Dec. 6. Democrats argued Sunday night that they would win the open seat next year in a district that Hillary Clinton won by six percentage points in 2016.”

Smithsonian: “Dogs have helped law enforcement and search-and-rescue crews discover human remains for decades. But recently, a new group has enlisted the help of canines and their olfactory superpowers: archaeologists. In a recent paper in the Journal of Archeological Method and Theory, Vedrana Glavaš, an archaeologist at the University of Zadar in Croatia, and Andrea Pintar, a cadaver dog handler, describe how dogs trained to find human remains helped them track down gravesites dating to around 700 B.C. For The Guardian, Joshua Rapp Learn reports that the team tested the dogs at a hilltop fort called Drvišica along Croatia’s Adriatic coast. … To test the dogs, Glavaš had them sniff around an area where they she had excavated three grave sites the year before. … Two dogs, working independently, easily located all three spots. … The study is a proof of concept that dogs could be used more extensively in archaeology as a non-destructive method of finding human burials…”

BIDEN SAYS HE ASKED OBAMA TO WITHHOLD ENDORSEMENT

NY Post: “Joe Biden claimed in a new interview that he asked Barack Obama not to endorse his run for president — and called President Trump an ‘idiot’ for saying Russian election interference is a ‘hoax.’ The former vice president appeared on ‘60 Minutes’ Sunday where he was asked by anchor Norah O’Donnell if Obama, who he served with for eight years in the White House, offered to throw his full support behind the campaign. ‘No, we didn’t even get there,’ Biden responded. ‘I asked him not to. He said, ‘OK’ ‘I think it’s better — I think he thinks it’s better for me.’ But if he ends up as the 2020 Democratic nominee, Biden, 76, said he had ‘no doubt” that Obama would ‘be out on the campaign trail for me.’”



Olivia Nuzzi: Biden’s zombie campaign - NY Mag: “The looming presence of the last guy, Jim, is especially important for optics. Jim is tall and official-looking. He greets the world chest-first, his hands resting in a dignified clasp, his expression even, his mouth unmoving. Most people assume that he’s a Secret Service agent. Which he was. But ex-VPs don’t get security for life the way ex-presidents do. Most people don’t know that, not even the politically savvy types who attend these sorts of things. And that’s all for the best, because Jim … is a necessary component of the vibe they’re trying to generate here, the Big Presidential Energy, if you will, that powers this production. And it is a production. This is true even when the event is small, which it often is, because the stakes never are — Joe Biden speaking off the cuff is something the entire campaign seems focused on preventing at all costs. … For political reporters, marveling every day at just how well this isn’t going, watching Biden can feel like being at the rodeo. You’re there because on some level you know you might see someone get killed.”



Climb gets steeper for bottom-tier in December debate - FiveThirtyEight: “For many Democratic presidential candidates, making the debates hasn’t been all that difficult. After all, 12 candidates made the stage in October, and nine have already qualified for the November debate. But on Friday, the Democratic National Committee released its strictest qualifying criteria yet, raising both the polling and donor thresholds for the December debate. And it looks like the new rules could be a thorn in the side of many candidates who have, up until now, qualified for recent debates. … But with over a month to still qualify, it’s likely at least two more candidates will make the cut. Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris each only need one more poll to qualify. After that, however, the likelihood that the other candidates qualify becomes, well, debatable.”



Tyler Perry debate host? - Atlanta Journal-Constitution: “We’re being told that the contract has yet to be signed, but plans are for the fifth debate of Democratic presidential candidates to be held on Nov. 20 at Tyler Perry Studios on the grounds of what once was Fort McPherson. … The newly opened $250 million studio is the only major film studio in the nation owned by an African American. The debate is certain to point to a crowning achievement for a once-struggling playwright who, more than 20 years ago, had been kicked out of his apartment and was living out of a car. That’s a message sure to be celebrated by Democrats who will be depending on a strong turn-out by African-Americans, who made up 60% of primary voters in 2018, in the 2020 election season.”



Rashida Tlaib backs Sanders at Detroit rally - Fox News: “Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., became the latest of her fellow ‘Squad’ members to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for president, joining him at a Detroit rally. ‘We deserve someone who writes the damn bills,’ she said, noting Sanders is a man of the people, as Detroit Free Press reported. ‘We deserve Bernie Sanders.’ Tlaib noted that Sanders is a transformative leader who offers solutions not beholden to corporations or the mediocre ideologies of the status quo. … Winning the OK of the ‘Squad’ members has been viewed as crucial in attracting young voters, as the top three Democrats in the polls are all senior citizens — Sanders is 78, former Vice President Joe Biden is 76 and Warren is 70 years old.”



SENATE REPUBLICANS GETTING ANTSY

WaPo: “In hushed conversations over the past week, GOP senators lamented that the fast-expanding probe is fraying their party, which remains completely in Trump’s grip. They voiced exasperation at the expectation that they defend the president against the troublesome picture that has been painted, with neither convincing arguments from the White House nor confidence that something worse won’t soon be discovered. ‘It feels like a horror movie,’ said one veteran Republican senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly describe the consensus.”



Ex-Bolton aide wants court to decide whether Trump can keep him quiet - Fox News: “Charles Kupperman, a former deputy to ex-National Security Adviser John Bolton, is looking to the courts to resolve a new standoff in the impeachment inquiry, as Democrats threaten him with contempt for defying a subpoena at the direction of the White House. The subpoena had ordered Kupperman to appear for a deposition Monday morning. He did not. In response to a tough letter from House Democratic leaders, Kupperman's attorney Charles Cooper suggested his client is willing to comply with their requests eventually — provided a judge tells him to do so.”



Enten: Impeachment unpopular in key swing states - CNN: “A look at the national polls indicate that impeaching and removing Trump from office is at, a minimum, a plurality position. … Indeed, take an examination of the battleground states that Democrats almost certainly need to make inroads into in 2020. The New York Times and Siena College, 2018's most accurate pollster, took a poll of voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Arizona. These were closest states in the country that cast their electoral votes for Trump in 2016. Just 43% of voters in these six states want to impeach and remove from office at this point. The majority, 53%, do not. This means that the margin for not impeaching and removing Trump in these states (+10 points) is running well ahead of Trump's margin in these states of about 1.5 points. Put another way, impeaching and removing Trump from office in these states is not a popular position.”



BEVIN BLUNDERS WITH DARE TO RIVAL

AP: “Entering the final days of Kentucky’s bitter race for governor, Republican incumbent Matt Bevin exposed himself to a new attack by flatly denying his recorded claim that suicides happen nightly in casinos. Telling a debate audience Saturday night that the truth matters, Bevin challenged his opponent to produce a tape proving his denial wrong. Democrat Andy Beshear offered up the audiotape Sunday. The televised exchange turned Bevin’s summer radio interview on WKDZ into a talking point for Democrats heading into the last full week of campaigning in the close gubernatorial contest. In the interview, Bevin claimed, without offering evidence, that suicides occur on a nightly basis in casinos. The exchange highlighted the rancor between the two rivals, which intensified when Beshear, as the state’s attorney general, repeatedly sued the governor for several of his policy and executive decisions.”

MONDAYS, CINDER, MONDAYS

WTTG: “A morbidly obese cat in Washington is under strict orders to shed some pounds -- and she's not happy about it. The extra-fluffy feline, named Cinder, was put on a water treadmill at a veterinarian's office in Bellingham. But instead of walking on all fours, the fat cat sat in the corner and used just one paw on the treadmill -- all the while meowing in frustration. Cinder, who also goes by the nickname ‘Cinder Block,’ had been surrendered to Northshore Veterinary Hospital by her previous owners. … The animal hospital said they decided to use an underwater treadmill for Cinder because she has arthritis in multiple joints and is carrying an extra 10 pounds of body weight. They started with a low water level to get her used to the feeling and are gradually raising it the more she uses it. Staff said she is still getting acclimated to using the treadmill.”

The former vice president – who was the unrivaled front-runner from even before he announced his candidacy in late April – is now tied with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at the top of many national and early voting state polls.

BIDEN SUPER PAC REVERSAL COMES AMID FUNDRAISING STRUGGLE

Biden said he still considers himself the leader in the race for the nomination, emphasizing, “I know I'm the front-runner. Find me a national poll with a notable — a couple exceptions (sic). But look, this is a marathon.""

Yet Biden has been underperforming when it comes to another key metric — fundraising. He raised just $15.2 million during the July-September quarter, far behind top-tier rivals Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. And as of Oct. 1, he had just $9 million cash-on-hand, far behind Sanders – who had nearly $34 million in the bank – and Warren, who had $26 million in her campaign coffers.

Asked by CBS' Nora O’Donnell how he can compete against that, the former vice president answered, ""I just flat beat them,” as he laughed.

“We're on a course to do extremely well,” he insisted. “I’m not worried about being able to fund this campaign. I really am not, truly.""

Biden was also pressed on the lack of endorsement from Obama, his boss for eight years in the White House.

""I want to earn this on my own,"" he stressed.

But asked if the former president offered to back him, Biden said, “No, we didn't even get there. I asked him not to. He said, ‘OK.’”

Biden added: “I think it's better — I think he thinks it's better for me. I have no doubt when I'm the nominee he'll be out on the campaign trail for me.""

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

The former vice president took aim at Trump over the president’s repeated comments that Russian interference in U.S. elections is a hoax.

""He's an idiot, in terms of sayin' that. Everybody knows this. Everybody knows it. Nobody doubts it,” Biden highlighted.

And asked how he would respond to Trump’s accusation that “Joe Biden and his son are stone-cold corrupt,” Biden said, “Let's see how straight you are, OK old buddy? I put out 21 years of mine. So show us your tax returns ... what are you hidin'? You want to deal with corruption? Start to act like it. Release your tax returns or shut up.""

As the president faces an impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives and as support for impeaching and removing the president increases, Trump and his allies have repeatedly tried to put the spotlight on the Bidens. Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – who had been widely accused by both Democrats and Republicans of overlooking corruption in his own office – was later dismissed.

Pressed by O’Donnell on whether he considered the optics of his son working for the Ukrainian company during his years in the White House, Biden contended that Hunter was already on the board when he took office.

Biden has said repeatedly that the only thing he asked his son about regarding sitting on the board of the company was, ""I hope you know what you're doing.""

Asked what he meant by that, Biden answered, “What I meant by that is I hope you've thought this through.”

""I hope you know exactly what you're doing here. That's all I meant. Nothing more than that, because I've never discussed my business or their business, my sons' or daughter's. And I've never discussed them because they know where I have to do my job and that's it and they have to make their own judgments,” he explained.

And Biden took aim at Trump’s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who serve as top advisers in the administration.

Biden vowed that he if gets “elected president, my children are not going to have offices in the White House. My children are not going to sit in on Cabinet meetings. ... It's just simply improper because you should make it clear to the American public that everything you're doing is for them. For them. And the idea that you’re going to have his children his — son-in-law, etcetera, engaged in the day-to-day operation of things they know nothing about.”

TRUMP CAMPAIGN RETURNS FIRE AFTER BIDEN '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW

Trump’s reelection campaign defended Ivanka and Jared and took aim at Hunter Biden, saying, “Hunter Biden would never have an office in the White House because he’s proven that his only qualification is being the son of Joe Biden.”"

The Supreme Court ruled in the case of Janus v. AFSCME that unions could not extract what’s called an “agency fee” from non-members who happened to work in the same place a union had “exclusive representation” rights. But one group argues that in saying it was unconstitutional to force people to fund labor unions’ speech with their own money, the high court also indicated that the legitimacy of “exclusive representation” itself could be up for debate.

""The issue with regard to exclusive representation was not presented to the court in the Janus case, but the court three separate times expressed grave concerns about the constitutionality of those provisions,"" said Robert Alt, chief executive of the Buckeye Institute, a free-market think tank. He says that the move by Justice Samual Alito in crafting the Janus opinion was an ""invitation for litigants"" to bring cases challenging exclusive representation.

SUPREME COURT REJECTS CASE OF CHRISTIAN TEEN FORCED TO WRITE ISLAMIC CONVERSION PRAYER

“We took that hint and have brought multiple cases in order to raise that question up to the Supreme Court,"" he told Fox News.

Alt and the Buckeye Institute are representing Jonathan Reisman -- an economics professor at the University of Maine who was for years active as a grievance officer with his local union -- in Reisman v. Associated Faculty of the University of Maine, a case challenging state-mandated exclusive representation schemes as unconstitutional.

Reisman lost his case in the First Circuit Court of Appeals earlier this month, but Alt said his institute intends to file a petition in early January asking the Supreme Court to hear it.

Over time, Reisman grew frustrated by the local union's association with two larger labor organizations whose political speech he didn't embrace: the Maine Education Association and the National Education Association.

While Reisman says in a profile on the Buckeye Institute's website that he was happy the Supreme Court ruled in Janus he would not have to fund union activities, he argues that is not enough. Maine has a law requiring any workplace in which 50 percent of the employees vote to be represented by a union to allow that group “exclusive representation” of all employees in that bargaining unit. This means Reisman cannot negotiate the terms of his employment for himself – the union speaks for him.

PHILADELPHIA'S 'SANCTUARY CITY' DA KRASNER AMONG PEOPLE FLOATED BY LIBERAL GROUP FOR SUPREME COURT

“The union still has the ability to be my exclusive representative,” Reisman said in a video. “And I’m still associated with the positions that they take. That really is the problem.”

As an example, Reisman wrote in an op-ed for The Portland Press Herald in 2018: ""Most recently, the NEA issued a ‘social justice’ grant to a now-retired University of Southern Maine professor, which was used to fund a trip to Washington promoted as a protest of the Brett Kavanaugh nomination, in violation of University of Maine System political advocacy and academic policies.""

JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS CITES 'DIFFERENT SETS OF RULES' FOR CRITICIZING HIM BECAUSE HE'S A CONSERVATIVE

The Buckeye Institute also represents teachers in two similar cases – a professor in Minnesota and a Spanish teacher in Ohio. Those cases are pending in lower courts.

The AFUM, the MEA and the NEA didn't respond to requests for comment.

It's unclear whether the Supreme Court will take up the Reisman case, let alone whether Reisman will prevail if it does. The top court often allows legal disputes to play out in the lower courts for years before stepping in.

But the case aims to strike a blow to the model of organized labor, since exclusive representation for employees makes a union more powerful than it otherwise might be, even if it's not collecting agency fees from nonmembers.

The New Jersey chapter of AFSCME explained how exclusive representation benefits unions in an FAQ on its website after the Janus ruling.

BERNIE SANDERS HITS PETE BUTTIGIEG FOR SUGGESTING SUPREME COURT NOMS SHOULD BE LIKE JUSTICE KENNEDY

""Exclusivity is how we stay out of a race to the bottom. When the union represents everyone in the unit, employers can’t pit worker against worker or union against union,"" it says. ""However, anti-union organizations and some unions that represent few public-sector workers have suggested that ending exclusivity would be a relief to public sector unions. They fail to understand that if non-members can be treated differently from members the employer could give non-members a better deal in the short run to entice members out of the union.""

The First Circuit, for its part, ruled earlier this month that exclusive representation does not violate public-sector workers' First Amendment rights because the union is the designated agent for the bargaining unit as a whole rather than each individual.

""Exclusive bargaining representation by a democratically selected union does not, without more, violate the right of free association on the part of dissenting non-union members of the bargaining unit,"" the court said, quoting itself in a different case from 2016.

The Buckeye Institute is not the only group testing the legal limits of Janus. A class-action suit filed in Illinois federal court earlier this year seeks to retroactively apply the ruling to force unions to pay back the dues it collected from non-members without their consent.

Alt says these and other cases that involve compelled speech have a strong chance of succeeding with the current composition of the Supreme Court.

""The Supreme Court has taken a renewed interest in the question of compelled speech,"" he told Fox News. ""It really turns on this issue of, is it permissible … for a state by state law to appoint a group to functionally lobby on behalf of an individual against their will? And I think the answer to that question is abundantly clear. There’s no way that is permissible under the First Amendment."""

Relax, there’s at most a little more than five years left in the media’s obsessive quest to impeach Trump. This too shall pass.

First we had journalists hyping an entirely anonymous book by the same author of the entirely anonymous anti-Trump op-ed published by The New York Times in September 2018.

Anti-Trump journalists swallowed this one like a handful of M&Ms handed out to trick-or-treaters.

ANONYMOUS OFFICIAL BEHIND INFAMOUS NYT OP-ED TO RELEASE BOOK ON TRUMP WHITE HOUSE

Are the charges in the op-ed true? Is the book accurate? With the writer hiding his or her identity like someone in the witness protection program, there’s no way of knowing and no way of challenging the writer’s claims.

Then things got even weirder.

“CBS This Morning” journalist Nikole Killion apparently time-traveled to promote her fantasy ticket for the 2020 election. She actually pressed Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., about whether he would pick fellow socialist media magnet Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., as his vice presidential running mate if he becomes the Democratic nominee to run against Trump.

There’s just one problem with this fantasy. The Constitution says the president and vice president must be at least 35 years old, and that means Ocasio-Cortez won’t be old enough to be elected to one of those offices until the 2024 election.

Time travel was all the rage. Politico's senior White House reporter Darren Samuelsohn must have been watching “Avengers: Endgame” for story tips. He took his readers on a time-travel trip to the scariest future he could imagine — in a Politico Magazine story headlined “What If Trump Wins?”

Oh, no, Mr. Bill. Not that!

Samuelsohn actually called his article a trip into “the POLITICO Time Machine.”

As the reporter envisioned it, Trump defeats Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in a close Electoral College battle, after losing the popular vote. “But this mixed verdict has done nothing but further entrench the battle lines of a civil war that has become more than just a metaphor,” Samuelsohn writes ominously.

The fantasy went on to predict that “people have been killed.” Trump orders “troops onto the streets of Washington” and helps secure the 2024 nomination for first daughter Ivanka Trump.

Yes, this hallucination ran on the pages of an alleged news organization and was written by a senior White House reporter. And in case it wasn’t clear enough, the message was: support Trump and you get civil war and tyranny.

Politico, D-D.C., has never been subtle.

But wait, there’s more pre-Halloween hijinks by Trump haters masquerading as journalists.

MSNBC “Morning Joe” host Joe Scarborough decided that just as people wouldn’t admit they supported Trump the first time, “people will be reluctant to admit publicly that they can’t put up with him anymore.” Despite a whole world of liberal media that would sing their praises.

Scarborough based the entire premise that “actually the fear and loathing is rising” on one conversation he had with a man in Florida. So, Florida Man is deciding the world view of an entire TV show.

Of course, this is the same Joe who also claimed a few days ago that Trump had committed massive crimes and it’s “all about failed casinos.” According to Scarborough, Trump “is owned by [Russian President Vladimir] Putin because he’s been laundering money, Russian money for the last 20, 30 years.”

The easiest way to tell Scarborough is lying is he still claims he’s “a conservative.”

Harvard student journalists attacked for practicing journalism

College is where many student journalists learn the basics of their craft — asking knowledgeable people “who, what, where, when, why and how” about the stories they cover – and seeking comment from more than one side.

Harvard Crimson staffers certainly got a lesson in how this works last week. They learned that Harvard leftists are biased idiots every single day.

And what’s worse, the leftists expect their college newspaper to reflect that worldview, such as it is.

The Harvard Crimson has a storied history going back 146 years. But history isn’t the paper’s problem. It has a problem with current events and the unwillingness of campus leftists to accept them.

Harvard leftists held a pro-immigration rally to protest the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE). The Crimson covered the event but had the audacity to ask ICE for a comment, which it didn’t provide.

The lefties were outraged by … journalism. The far-left group that organized the initial protest, Act on a Dream, even launched a petition to stop the Crimson from ever doing journalism again. The petition whined about the paper’s “cultural insensitivity” and demanded the staff “apologize for the harm they inflicted.”

The protesters were upset because they claimed the paper informed on them to The Man. What’s funny is that the paper went out of its way to not do that, waiting until the event was over to ask for the comment it never got.

The paper is standing up to protesters — for now. At least this should provide the student journalists a clear lesson for the future. Leftists demand and usually receive fealty from most professional journalists. So the student journalists might stand up now, but they’ll be expected to bend the knee later on.

The one group it’s OK to hate

There’s one group journalists love to hate: old white guys who are Republicans or conservatives, or maybe both.

That racial double standard was on full display last week when journalists screamed about Trump using the word “lynch” but forgot they hadn’t been bothered by it when Biden and other Democrats used the term during the Clinton impeachment.

But the “neutral” news media really worked itself into an uproar when roughly two dozen Republicans entered a House closed-door impeachment hearing this past week without authorization.

MSNBC’s Donny Deutsch blasted the Republicans to the “Morning Joe” audience. He called them ""those white guys, those middle-aged, boring, nerdy-looking white guys.” (Donny apparently has no mirrors in his home or office.) Picture an outlet mocking the race of congressmen when Democrats staged an anti-gun sit-in on the House floor in 2016.

CNN went even further. Commentator Keith Boykin said the action by Republican House members was reminiscent of the KKK. “This looked like a Klan group assembled outside a jail trying to get the sheriff to let them in so they could deliver justice to somebody who was inside,” he told anchor Jake Tapper. For his part, Tapper responded with the mildest of critiques. “Respectfully, I think the Klan metaphor was a little strong,” he said.

Ya think?

The only bright spot came on CBS when “Late Show” host Stephen Colbert mocked the race of the Republicans as well. Because, at least he was funny. He described the scene, saying, “That is a large herd of white men. By the way, a herd of white men is called a ‘A J. Crew.’ A ‘J. Crew’ of white men.”

In 2019, it’s OK to make fun of people’s race as long as they’re on the right.

The first image, released by the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) in Garching, Germany, combined X-ray images of a neighboring galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud, along with a pair of interacting clusters of galaxies at a distance of about 800 million light-years.

“These first images from our telescope show the true beauty of the hidden universe,” said Peter Predehl, principal investigator of eROSITA, in a statement. “To meet our science goals we needed enough sensitivity to detect the most distant clusters of galaxies in the universe over the whole sky, and resolve them spatially. These first light images show that we can do exactly that, but we can go a lot further.”

HOW TO SPOT A WORMHOLE

According to the MPE, each telescope is equipped with state-of-the-art CCD cameras with superb spectral and timing resolution. “The potential for new discoveries is immense. Now we can start reaping the fruits of more than 10 years of work,” added Predehl.

Another eROSITA image of the A3391/3395 system of clusters of galaxies shows the different processes that lead to the formation of so-called gigantic structures in the universe, according to scientists.

The clusters, which look like large nebulae in the images, actually span tens of millions of light-years across, and contain thousands of galaxies each.

“X-rays give us a unique view of the Universe, hidden in visible light,” said Kirpal Nandra, director of high-energy astrophysics at MPE. “Looking at an apparently normal star, in X-rays we might see an orbiting white dwarf or neutron star in the process of devouring its companion. Visible light shows the structure of a galaxy traced by its stars, but the X-rays are dominated by supermassive black holes growing at their centers.""

Nandra continued: ""And where we see clusters of galaxies with optical telescopes, X-rays reveal the huge reservoirs of gas filling the space between them and tracing out the dark matter structure of the Universe. With its performance demonstrated, we now know that eROSITA will lead to a breakthrough in our understanding of the evolution of the energetic Universe.""

The eROSITA was launched on July 13 as part of the Russian-German Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) space mission and has now entered its target orbit 100 days after launch."

* Yesterday, Donald Trump’s re-election campaign launched a fundraising campaign based on the demise of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the founder and leader of ISIS.

* Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) has thrown her support behind Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) presidential campaign. She’s the fifth sitting U.S. House member to endorse the Vermont senator’s candidacy. Overall, Sanders now ranks fifth in the 2020 field for House endorsements, trailing Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Elizabeth Warren.

* On a related note, on Election Day 2020, Bernie Sanders will be 79 years old, though the Washington Post reports that the independent lawmaker wants that to be seen as an asset for his presidential campaign.

* As a member of Congress, Mike Pompeo (R-Kansas) was occasionally derided as “the Koch Brothers’ Congressman.” Now that he’s Donald Trump’s secretary of State, eyeing a possible U.S. Senate race in 2020, Pompeo reportedly discussed the race with billionaire Charles Koch late last week.

* On a related note, the Kansas City Star ran a rather brutal editorial on Friday, directed at the Republican cabinet secretary: “If Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is running to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, then he should quit his rather important day job and do that. Or if, as he told The Star and The Wichita Eagle in a testy, credulity-straining interview on Thursday, he isn’t even thinking about it, then he should by all means focus on U.S. diplomacy – remember diplomacy? – and stop hanging out here every chance he gets.”

* As the number of college students casting ballots grows, Republican officials in a variety of states are taking new steps to make it harder for these young voters to participate.

* Maine’s Democratic U.S. Senate primary field narrowed a bit late last week, with retired Air Force Gen. Jon Treacy dropping out of the race, citing subpar fundraising. Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon appears to be the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination.

* And former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, taking on Donald Trump in a GOP primary, was asked last week whom he’d support in a Biden-vs-Trump race. “Could I vote for a Democrat? Hell yes,” Weld replied. “If it’s Trump against Joe Biden, I’m with Biden in a heartbeat.”"

Tlaib noted that Sanders is a transformative leader who offers solutions not beholden to corporations or the mediocre ideologies of the status quo.

""We need a new vision for American and that's what our campaign is about,"" Sanders said. ""The most important and significant opposition we face … is the limitation to our imaginations.”

Sanders also took the time to praise Tlaib for her role in representing the party’s progressive wing.

""What Rashida has been doing in less than one year is become a national figure, not just in standing up against the vulgarity and ugliness of Donald Trump, but she has taken on in a very forceful way, the greed and corruption of the economic establishment and stood up to the political establishment as well,"" he said.

Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Ilhan Omar., D-Minn., expressed their support for Sanders last week. Ocasio-Cortez recently appeared alongside Sanders at a major rally in Queens, N.Y., that reportedly drew more than 20,000 people. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., is the only ""Squad"" member who has yet to make an endorsement.

“I would do my best to identify who that police officer is. In a polite way, ask him or her for their name. I would respect what they are doing so that you don’t get shot in the back of the head,” the Democratic presidential candidate said. “But I would also be very mindful of the fact that as a nation we have got to hold police officers accountable for the actions that they commit.”

Sanders then summed up by saying that while he would be cautious, people should still do their best to defend their individual rights and keep police officers in line.

“So to answer your question, I would be very cautious if you were my son in terms of dealing with that police officer. But I would also defend my rights, and know my rights, and make sure -- if possible -- that police officer’s camera is on or goes on.”

Sanders’ answer was very different from the one former Vice President Joe Biden gave when a female student asked a similar question at the same event.

Biden, once the unrivaled front-runner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination in most national polling and many early primary and caucus state surveys, now stands at 15 percent support among likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire, according to a new University of New Hampshire poll conducted for CNN.

That's a drop of 9 percentage points since the previous UNH/CNN survey, which was conducted in July.

WARREN OPENS UP 7-POINT EDGE OVER BIDEN IN NATIONAL POLL

Asked about the new poll, Biden told MSNBC on Tuesday that “polls, as you know, are up and down.”

The former vice president stated that he still planned on performing well in New Hampshire and the other early-voting states of Iowa, Nevada and South Carolina.

The survey indicates Sen. Bernie Sanders stands at 21 percent support, with progressive rival Elizabeth Warren at 18 percent. There’s no front-runner in the new poll, as Sanders’ 3 point edge over Warren is within the survey’s sampling error for likely Democratic primary voters. Both Sanders and Warren – who hail from the neighboring states of Vermont and Massachusetts, respectively – stood at 19 percent in the July survey, trailing Biden.

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg – at 10 percent – is the only other candidate in the still-large field of Democratic White House hopefuls to crack double digits. His numbers are unchanged from the summer survey.

The new poll was conducted Oct. 21-27, entirely after the fourth round Democratic presidential nomination debate.

The survey indicates Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang are tied at 5 percent support, with each gaining support from the summer survey. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and billionaire businessman and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer are each at 3 percent. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas register at 2 percent, with everyone else at 1 percent or less.

New Hampshire presidential primary voters are traditionally late deciders, which is reflected in the survey. With three-and-a-half months to go until the February contest, only 23 percent said they’ve definitely decided on which candidate they’ll support. Just over one in five said they’re leaning toward a candidate, with a whopping 57 percent saying they remain undecided.

Biden – who returns to New Hampshire at the end of next week to formally file to place his name on the primary ballot – still leads when it comes to electability. Thirty-six percent of those questioned say he has the best chance of any Democratic White House hopeful of beating President Trump in next year’s general election. But that’s down from 45 percent in July. And in the new survey, the former vice president grabs just 20 percent support among his core groups — voters 50 and older, and self-described moderates and conservatives.

POLL SUGGESTS MICHELLE OBAMA WOULD BE FRONT-RUNNER IN NH IF SHE ENTERED THE WHITE HOUSE RACE

Warren doubled her electability number, from 9 percent in July to 18 percent now. And Sanders widened his lead over Warren as the most progressive candidate in the field — from 40-23 percent in July to 47-18 percent now.

Buttigieg saw his favorable rating rise from 48 percent in July to 55 percent now. Klobuchar saw her favorability soar from 24 percent in the summer to 40 percent now. And Yang’s favorable rating skyrocketed as well, from 17 percent to 36 percent.

In the Republican presidential primary, Trump remains the overwhelming front-runner, with 86 percent support among likely GOP primary voters in New Hampshire.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Even though he’s visited the Granite State nearly every week since launching his long-shot primary challenge in April, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld stood at just 5 percent. But he’s ahead of the two other Republican presidential primary long shots. Both former South Carolina governor and congressman Mark Sanford and former conservative radio talk show host and one-term congressman from Illinois Joe Walsh are each at just 1 percent in the poll.

The UNH/CNN poll was conducted using live telephone operators, who questioned 574 likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire. The margin of error for Democratic primary questions is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points. Four-hundred-and-sixty-one likely GOP primary voters were also questioned, with a sampling error of plus or minus 4.6 percentage points."

The report, published by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, examines a variety of potential ways to raise the estimated $30 trillion over 10 years necessary to fund ""Medicare-for-all,"" including a 32 percent payroll tax, a 25 percent income surtax and a 42 percent value-added tax. These methods could all raise $30 trillion, the report says, but there is no way for the federal government to bring in that much money simply by taxing rich people.

""There is not enough annual income available among higher earners to finance the full cost of 'Medicare-for-All,'"" it says. ""On a static basis, even increasing the top two income tax rates (applying to individuals making over $204,000 per year and couples making over $408,000 per year) to 100 percent would not raise $30 trillion over a decade.""

An accompanying chart lists the tax-the-rich funding option as ""IMPOSSIBLE.""

HOUSE REPUBLICANS RELEASE PLAN IN BID TO FULFILL TRUMP PROMISE AS 'PARTY OF HEALTH CARE'

The role of middle-class taxes in funding ""Medicare-for-all"" has become a point of contention in the Democratic primary, and it showed at the most recent debate in Ohio. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren tiptoed around questions from the moderators about whether or not middle-class taxes would increase under her ""Medicare-for-all"" health care plan. Warren chose to focus on net costs instead.

""I will not sign a bill into law that does not cut costs for middle-class families,"" she said.

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who endorses a public option plan rather than Warren's single-payer ""Medicare-for-all,"" accused her of being evasive.

""Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything — except for this,"" he said. ""No plan has been laid out to explain how a multitrillion-dollar hole in this Medicare-for-all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who is fond of reminding Democratic contenders endorsing ""Medicare-for-all"" that he ""wrote the damn bill,"" was more open than Warren about his plans to finance the $30 trillion health care plan.

ELIZABETH WARREN'S CAMPAIGN IS AT A 'MAKE-OR-BREAK' MOMENT, SAYS CHARLES PAYNE

""It is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up,"" he said, “for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.”

A 32 percent payroll tax increase would bring the rate to 47 percent on most wage income, according to the CRFB report. A 25 percent income surtax would force the lowest federal income tax rates to 35 percent and compel the top earners to pay 62 percent of their income.

The options for financing ""Medicare-for-all"" without increasing taxes are similarly immoderate. The CRFB says the federal government would need to cut ""non-health federal spending by 80 percent"" in order to pay for ""Medicare-for-all"" without increasing taxes. This would require cutting Social Security benefits from approximately $18,000 to about $3,600 each year and cutting troop numbers from 1.3 million to 270,000.

If a Warren or a Sanders administration decided to finance ""Medicare-for-all"" simply on debt, consequences could be dire, according to the report.

BUTTIGIEG, KLOBUCHAR SLAM WARREN FOR NOT SAYING HOW SHE'LL FINANCE 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL'

""Deficit-financing 'Medicare-for-All' would be far more damaging to the economy,"" the report says. ""Assuming that such a massive increase in the debt would not roil financial markets or lead to high inflation, we estimate that a 108 percent of GDP increase in the federal debt would shrink the size of the economy by roughly 5 percent in 2030 – the equivalent of a $4,500 reduction in per-person income – and far more in the following years.""

The CFRB report also points out lawmakers could combine several of the above-listed options to reduce the impact any one option might have. As an example for one way a bill could get to $30 trillion in revenue over 10 years, the report suggests, ""a 16 percent employer-side payroll tax with a public premium averaging $8,000 per household ($3,000 per person), $5 trillion of taxes on high earners and corporations, and $1 trillion of spending cuts.""

The report also acknowledges the best way to finance ""Medicare-for-all"" might be to make the plan less ambitious than progressive leaders like Sanders and Warren have proposed.

""While the financing options above are quite large in magnitude, they could be reduced significantly by reducing the cost of 'Medicare-for-All' itself,"" the report says. ""These cost reductions could be achieved in part by reforming or reducing provider payments, improving care coordination, and identifying policies to reduce excessive utilization of care.""

WALDEN CALLS QUITS AS GOP RETIREMENT RIPTIDE CONTINUES

Politico: “Rep. Greg Walden, the top Republican on the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, will retire at the end of this Congress, the veteran lawmaker announced Monday. The 62-year-old Walden, who was first elected in 1998, said he was confident he'd win reelection but decided instead to end his congressional career in Jan. 2021. ‘Based on recent polling, strong fundraising, and the backing of my wife and family, I am confident I could earn the support of 2nd District voters for another term.’ … ‘But I also know that for me, the time has come to pursue new challenges and opportunities.’ … The Oregon congressman is the 17th House Republican to announce their retirement this cycle, a sign of how difficult it will be for the GOP to win back the majority in what’s already shaping up as a tough 2020 election.”



California congresswoman resigns amid sex scandal - WaPo: “Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.) on Sunday announced her resignation from Congress amid an ethics inquiry into allegations that she had an intimate relationship with a congressional staff member in her office. ‘It is with a broken heart that today I announce my resignation from Congress,’ Hill wrote in a statement. ‘This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, but I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community, and our country.’ Hill’s spokeswoman said that the resignation is not immediate and that Hill is still deciding on when she will leave office. … Last week, the House Ethics Committee opened an investigation into allegations that Hill was romantically involved with her legislative director, Graham Kelly, a relationship that would violate House ethics rules. … Hill’s announcement comes ahead of an early filing deadline for the seat — Dec. 6. Democrats argued Sunday night that they would win the open seat next year in a district that Hillary Clinton won by six percentage points in 2016.”



THE RULEBOOK: YEP. YEP, YEP, YEP

“It has until lately been a received and uncontradicted opinion that the prosperity of the people of America depended on their continuing firmly united, and the wishes, prayers, and efforts of our best and wisest citizens have been constantly directed to that object.” – John Jay, Federalist No. 2



TIME OUT: GIVE A DOG A BONE

Smithsonian: “Dogs have helped law enforcement and search-and-rescue crews discover human remains for decades. But recently, a new group has enlisted the help of canines and their olfactory superpowers: archaeologists. In a recent paper in the Journal of Archeological Method and Theory, Vedrana Glavaš, an archaeologist at the University of Zadar in Croatia, and Andrea Pintar, a cadaver dog handler, describe how dogs trained to find human remains helped them track down gravesites dating to around 700 B.C. For The Guardian, Joshua Rapp Learn reports that the team tested the dogs at a hilltop fort called Drvišica along Croatia’s Adriatic coast. … To test the dogs, Glavaš had them sniff around an area where they she had excavated three grave sites the year before. … Two dogs, working independently, easily located all three spots. … The study is a proof of concept that dogs could be used more extensively in archaeology as a non-destructive method of finding human burials…”

BIDEN SAYS HE ASKED OBAMA TO WITHHOLD ENDORSEMENT

NY Post: “Joe Biden claimed in a new interview that he asked Barack Obama not to endorse his run for president — and called President Trump an ‘idiot’ for saying Russian election interference is a ‘hoax.’ The former vice president appeared on ‘60 Minutes’ Sunday where he was asked by anchor Norah O’Donnell if Obama, who he served with for eight years in the White House, offered to throw his full support behind the campaign. ‘No, we didn’t even get there,’ Biden responded. ‘I asked him not to. He said, ‘OK’ ‘I think it’s better — I think he thinks it’s better for me.’ But if he ends up as the 2020 Democratic nominee, Biden, 76, said he had ‘no doubt” that Obama would ‘be out on the campaign trail for me.’”



Olivia Nuzzi: Biden’s zombie campaign - NY Mag: “The looming presence of the last guy, Jim, is especially important for optics. Jim is tall and official-looking. He greets the world chest-first, his hands resting in a dignified clasp, his expression even, his mouth unmoving. Most people assume that he’s a Secret Service agent. Which he was. But ex-VPs don’t get security for life the way ex-presidents do. Most people don’t know that, not even the politically savvy types who attend these sorts of things. And that’s all for the best, because Jim … is a necessary component of the vibe they’re trying to generate here, the Big Presidential Energy, if you will, that powers this production. And it is a production. This is true even when the event is small, which it often is, because the stakes never are — Joe Biden speaking off the cuff is something the entire campaign seems focused on preventing at all costs. … For political reporters, marveling every day at just how well this isn’t going, watching Biden can feel like being at the rodeo. You’re there because on some level you know you might see someone get killed.”



Climb gets steeper for bottom-tier in December debate - FiveThirtyEight: “For many Democratic presidential candidates, making the debates hasn’t been all that difficult. After all, 12 candidates made the stage in October, and nine have already qualified for the November debate. But on Friday, the Democratic National Committee released its strictest qualifying criteria yet, raising both the polling and donor thresholds for the December debate. And it looks like the new rules could be a thorn in the side of many candidates who have, up until now, qualified for recent debates. … But with over a month to still qualify, it’s likely at least two more candidates will make the cut. Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris each only need one more poll to qualify. After that, however, the likelihood that the other candidates qualify becomes, well, debatable.”



Tyler Perry debate host? - Atlanta Journal-Constitution: “We’re being told that the contract has yet to be signed, but plans are for the fifth debate of Democratic presidential candidates to be held on Nov. 20 at Tyler Perry Studios on the grounds of what once was Fort McPherson. … The newly opened $250 million studio is the only major film studio in the nation owned by an African American. The debate is certain to point to a crowning achievement for a once-struggling playwright who, more than 20 years ago, had been kicked out of his apartment and was living out of a car. That’s a message sure to be celebrated by Democrats who will be depending on a strong turn-out by African-Americans, who made up 60% of primary voters in 2018, in the 2020 election season.”



Rashida Tlaib backs Sanders at Detroit rally - Fox News: “Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., became the latest of her fellow ‘Squad’ members to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for president, joining him at a Detroit rally. ‘We deserve someone who writes the damn bills,’ she said, noting Sanders is a man of the people, as Detroit Free Press reported. ‘We deserve Bernie Sanders.’ Tlaib noted that Sanders is a transformative leader who offers solutions not beholden to corporations or the mediocre ideologies of the status quo. … Winning the OK of the ‘Squad’ members has been viewed as crucial in attracting young voters, as the top three Democrats in the polls are all senior citizens — Sanders is 78, former Vice President Joe Biden is 76 and Warren is 70 years old.”



SENATE REPUBLICANS GETTING ANTSY

WaPo: “In hushed conversations over the past week, GOP senators lamented that the fast-expanding probe is fraying their party, which remains completely in Trump’s grip. They voiced exasperation at the expectation that they defend the president against the troublesome picture that has been painted, with neither convincing arguments from the White House nor confidence that something worse won’t soon be discovered. ‘It feels like a horror movie,’ said one veteran Republican senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly describe the consensus.”



Ex-Bolton aide wants court to decide whether Trump can keep him quiet - Fox News: “Charles Kupperman, a former deputy to ex-National Security Adviser John Bolton, is looking to the courts to resolve a new standoff in the impeachment inquiry, as Democrats threaten him with contempt for defying a subpoena at the direction of the White House. The subpoena had ordered Kupperman to appear for a deposition Monday morning. He did not. In response to a tough letter from House Democratic leaders, Kupperman's attorney Charles Cooper suggested his client is willing to comply with their requests eventually — provided a judge tells him to do so.”



Enten: Impeachment unpopular in key swing states - CNN: “A look at the national polls indicate that impeaching and removing Trump from office is at, a minimum, a plurality position. … Indeed, take an examination of the battleground states that Democrats almost certainly need to make inroads into in 2020. The New York Times and Siena College, 2018's most accurate pollster, took a poll of voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Arizona. These were closest states in the country that cast their electoral votes for Trump in 2016. Just 43% of voters in these six states want to impeach and remove from office at this point. The majority, 53%, do not. This means that the margin for not impeaching and removing Trump in these states (+10 points) is running well ahead of Trump's margin in these states of about 1.5 points. Put another way, impeaching and removing Trump from office in these states is not a popular position.”



BEVIN BLUNDERS WITH DARE TO RIVAL

AP: “Entering the final days of Kentucky’s bitter race for governor, Republican incumbent Matt Bevin exposed himself to a new attack by flatly denying his recorded claim that suicides happen nightly in casinos. Telling a debate audience Saturday night that the truth matters, Bevin challenged his opponent to produce a tape proving his denial wrong. Democrat Andy Beshear offered up the audiotape Sunday. The televised exchange turned Bevin’s summer radio interview on WKDZ into a talking point for Democrats heading into the last full week of campaigning in the close gubernatorial contest. In the interview, Bevin claimed, without offering evidence, that suicides occur on a nightly basis in casinos. The exchange highlighted the rancor between the two rivals, which intensified when Beshear, as the state’s attorney general, repeatedly sued the governor for several of his policy and executive decisions.”

MONDAYS, CINDER, MONDAYS

WTTG: “A morbidly obese cat in Washington is under strict orders to shed some pounds -- and she's not happy about it. The extra-fluffy feline, named Cinder, was put on a water treadmill at a veterinarian's office in Bellingham. But instead of walking on all fours, the fat cat sat in the corner and used just one paw on the treadmill -- all the while meowing in frustration. Cinder, who also goes by the nickname ‘Cinder Block,’ had been surrendered to Northshore Veterinary Hospital by her previous owners. … The animal hospital said they decided to use an underwater treadmill for Cinder because she has arthritis in multiple joints and is carrying an extra 10 pounds of body weight. They started with a low water level to get her used to the feeling and are gradually raising it the more she uses it. Staff said she is still getting acclimated to using the treadmill.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“First, have the Trumpites not been telling us for six months that no collusion ever happened? And now they say: Sure it happened. So what? Everyone does it. What's left of your credibility when you make such a casual about-face?” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on July 13, 2017.

The former vice president – who was the unrivaled front-runner from even before he announced his candidacy in late April – is now tied with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at the top of many national and early voting state polls.

BIDEN SUPER PAC REVERSAL COMES AMID FUNDRAISING STRUGGLE

Biden said he still considers himself the leader in the race for the nomination, emphasizing, “I know I'm the front-runner. Find me a national poll with a notable — a couple exceptions (sic). But look, this is a marathon.""

Yet Biden has been underperforming when it comes to another key metric — fundraising. He raised just $15.2 million during the July-September quarter, far behind top-tier rivals Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. And as of Oct. 1, he had just $9 million cash-on-hand, far behind Sanders – who had nearly $34 million in the bank – and Warren, who had $26 million in her campaign coffers.

Asked by CBS' Nora O’Donnell how he can compete against that, the former vice president answered, ""I just flat beat them,” as he laughed.

“We're on a course to do extremely well,” he insisted. “I’m not worried about being able to fund this campaign. I really am not, truly.""

Biden was also pressed on the lack of endorsement from Obama, his boss for eight years in the White House.

""I want to earn this on my own,"" he stressed.

But asked if the former president offered to back him, Biden said, “No, we didn't even get there. I asked him not to. He said, ‘OK.’”

Biden added: “I think it's better — I think he thinks it's better for me. I have no doubt when I'm the nominee he'll be out on the campaign trail for me.""

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

The former vice president took aim at Trump over the president’s repeated comments that Russian interference in U.S. elections is a hoax.

""He's an idiot, in terms of sayin' that. Everybody knows this. Everybody knows it. Nobody doubts it,” Biden highlighted.

And asked how he would respond to Trump’s accusation that “Joe Biden and his son are stone-cold corrupt,” Biden said, “Let's see how straight you are, OK old buddy? I put out 21 years of mine. So show us your tax returns ... what are you hidin'? You want to deal with corruption? Start to act like it. Release your tax returns or shut up.""

As the president faces an impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives and as support for impeaching and removing the president increases, Trump and his allies have repeatedly tried to put the spotlight on the Bidens. Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – who had been widely accused by both Democrats and Republicans of overlooking corruption in his own office – was later dismissed.

Pressed by O’Donnell on whether he considered the optics of his son working for the Ukrainian company during his years in the White House, Biden contended that Hunter was already on the board when he took office.

Biden has said repeatedly that the only thing he asked his son about regarding sitting on the board of the company was, ""I hope you know what you're doing.""

Asked what he meant by that, Biden answered, “What I meant by that is I hope you've thought this through.”

""I hope you know exactly what you're doing here. That's all I meant. Nothing more than that, because I've never discussed my business or their business, my sons' or daughter's. And I've never discussed them because they know where I have to do my job and that's it and they have to make their own judgments,” he explained.

And Biden took aim at Trump’s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who serve as top advisers in the administration.

Biden vowed that he if gets “elected president, my children are not going to have offices in the White House. My children are not going to sit in on Cabinet meetings. ... It's just simply improper because you should make it clear to the American public that everything you're doing is for them. For them. And the idea that you’re going to have his children his — son-in-law, etcetera, engaged in the day-to-day operation of things they know nothing about.”

TRUMP CAMPAIGN RETURNS FIRE AFTER BIDEN '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW

Trump’s reelection campaign defended Ivanka and Jared and took aim at Hunter Biden, saying, “Hunter Biden would never have an office in the White House because he’s proven that his only qualification is being the son of Joe Biden.”"

DEMS PONDER LATE ENTRY: WHITE KNIGHT OR DON QUIXOTE?

How late is too late?



That’s the question some anxious Democrats are asking as they look beyond the existing field of 2020 candidates for potential nominees to face President Trump.



In the week since a NYT report about Democratic donors looking for new candidates to enter the race was published, there’s been quite a bit of huffing and puffing over the possibility. It’s a fun Washington parlor game, no doubt. But is it anything more than that?



From a practical perspective, it’s probably already too late for all but the most famous, best-liked political figures in the nation to build a campaign that could compete. And that’s a very short list indeed – one that, by our thinking, currently comprises just one person: Michelle Obama.



But what if someone other than the former first lady wanted to launch a bid at this late date?



Names mentioned for a late launch include former Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former Attorney General Eric Holder, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown and former Vice President Al Gore. Candidates like those would certainly make a splash upon entry, but it’s hard to imagine that any of those microwaved leftovers would be more than yet another second-tier contender in a crowded field.



This is already a group in which well-known sitting senators are struggling to get to 3 percent of the vote after months of campaigning and millions of dollars spent. It just doesn’t stand to reason that the aforementioned – especially those only begrudgingly accepted by Democrats in the past – would be doing much better.



As Nate Silver points out, while some Democratic elites may be unsatisfied with their choices, the party as a whole is quite happy with what’s on offer. Polls show very high levels of satisfaction among Democratic voters. And the only place to start would be in attacking the frontrunner, Joe Biden, a move that would only further alienate voters.



Maybe the party insiders are right that the field is actually weak, but if voters don’t agree, a late entrant looks like Don Quixote, not a white knight. And if a candidate like that did want to run, it’s not just the constraints of politics that would be challenging, but the electoral calendar itself.



Democrats have frontloaded their primary schedule for this cycle in hopes of a swift decision. That means that the filing deadlines for key contests are now just weeks away, including New Hampshire on Nov. 15.



More ominously for potential late entrants, Democrats will allocate more than a third of all delegates on Super Tuesday in the first week of March, which means major filing deadlines are fast approaching. The biggest prize of them all, California, requires candidates to file by Nov. 26 for its Super Tuesday contests, with other delegate-rich states like Texas and Massachusetts following soon thereafter.



It may not technically be too late for a candidate with deep pockets and a well-known name to launch a candidacy, but it will be soon. And practically speaking, it’s probably already past time given the demands of fundraising and organizing.



If Democrats do end up with a split decision and a contested convention this summer, it’s possible that delegates could turn to a party elder not already on the ballot. But barring a meltdown in Milwaukee, Democrats will almost certainly have to choose from among those already running.



The musings of donors at dinner parties will more likely slip from memory more quickly than their last bottle of Beaujolais.



SOUTH CAROLINA PRIEST REFUSED BIDEN COMMUNION

Florence [S.C.] Morning News: “Former Vice President Joe Biden, a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 presidential race, was denied Holy Communion on Sunday morning at a Florence church. Father Robert E. Morey of Saint Anthony Catholic Church confirmed Monday afternoon that he had denied the presidential candidate Holy Communion because of his stance on abortion. Biden, a lifelong Catholic, had attended the church’s 9 a.m. Mass. … ‘Sadly, this past Sunday, I had to refuse Holy Communion to former Vice President Joe Biden,’ Morey told the Morning News via email. … Morey said that as a priest, it is his responsibility to minister to those souls entrusted to his care and that he must do so in even the most difficult situations. ‘I will keep Mr. Biden in my prayers,’ Morey added.”



The storm of Biden media coverage seems to have passed - FiveThirtyEight: “When news about President Trump’s call to Ukraine first broke in late September, it seemed like former Vice President Joe Biden would be inextricably linked to the story. Biden was mentioned in more cable news clips and online news stories that week than every other 2020 Democratic candidate combined, according to data from the TV News Archive, which chops up cable news across the three networks we monitor — CNN, MSNBC and Fox News — into 15-second clips and Media Cloud, a database of online news. That week, Biden was mentioned in 74 percent of cable news clips, while Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the next most-mentioned candidate, was only in 16 percent of clips. In the past two weeks, however, as the initial flood of impeachment coverage has ebbed, so has the extra attention for Biden.”



Bernie gains ground in New Hampshire - CNN: “Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (21%) and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (18%) are in a close race among likely voters in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation Democratic presidential primary, according to a new CNN poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire. Former Vice President Joe Biden stands a shade behind at 15%, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg rounds out the field of four who reach double-digits with 10%. Behind that group, three candidates land at 5% in the poll -- Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and businessman Andrew Yang. California Sen. Kamala Harris, who stood at 9% in a July New Hampshire poll, now holds just 3% support.”



Harris blames her ethnicity, gender for poor performance - National Review: “Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris described electability as the ‘elephant in the room’ of her campaign and pondered whether America is ready for a woman of color to be commander in chief. ‘Essentially, is America ready for a woman and a woman of color to be president of the United States?’ Harris said in an interview with Axios on HBO. ‘There is a lack of ability or a difficulty in imagining that someone whom we have never seen can do a job that has been done 45 times by someone who is not that person.’ The same conversation happened when Barack Obama ran for president, the California senator added. Harris has been especially vocal about both racial justice and women’s rights during her 2020 campaign.”



Harrop: Amy, what’cha wanna do? - Real Clear Politics: “A new piece in The Economist, ‘Amy Klobuchar for sanity,’ urges Democrats to give the senator ‘a look.’ It portrays her as an exemplar of Midwest pragmatism who could become a moderate alternative to Joe Biden. Mayor Pete's ace is his fine intellect and military service in Afghanistan. … His support for extending health coverage to undocumented immigrants has political strategists slapping their heads. Democrats don't like talking about this, but Buttigieg's outwardly gay identity, as well as his tender age of 37, could work against him in a national election. That leaves Klobuchar as one of the more plausible Democrats to beat Trump. Her momentum follows a frontal assault on Elizabeth Warren's ‘Medicare for All’ plan during the debate. Klobuchar called it a ‘pipe dream’ that would require a significant tax increase on the middle class.”



THE RULEBOOK: TRICKLE DOWN

“Civil power, properly organized and exerted, is capable of diffusing its force to a very great extent; and can, in a manner, reproduce itself in every part of a great empire by a judicious arrangement of subordinate institutions.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 13



TIME OUT: UNDER PONTIUS PILATE

NatGeo: “Pontius Pilate is a man many Jews and Christians love to hate. For Christians, the Roman governor of Judaea played a central role in the execution of Jesus around A.D. 30, while for Jews he was a callous ruler who set the stage for the rebellion that led to the destruction of Jerusalem four decades later. But a new discovery suggests that Pilate also spent a good deal of time and money embellishing the famous city that drew Jewish pilgrims as well as visitors from around the Roman Empire. Archaeologists tunneling beneath a Palestinian neighborhood just south of Jerusalem’s walls are uncovering a monumental stepped street that led to the foot of the Temple Mount, the sacred platform that once held the Jewish Temple and now is home to some of Islam’s holiest sites. The impressive walkway stretched more than a third of a mile, was 26 feet wide, and required some ten thousand tons of limestone slabs.”

ARMY COLONEL CORROBORATES QUID PRO QUO CLAIMS

WaPo: “National Security Council Ukraine expert Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman’s testimony in the House impeachment probe Tuesday is shedding new light on how Trump administration officials pressured Ukrainian leaders into investigations that could benefit the president, corroborating other witnesses with a firsthand account of the alleged attempt at a quid pro quo. Vindman’s prepared remarks directly challenge the testimony of U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, who defended the president’s actions and told House investigators that no one had raised concerns about them. Sondland told the top American diplomat in Ukraine, Ambassador William B. Taylor Jr., in September text messages saying [Donald] Trump had not engaged in a quid pro quo; those text messages were provided to investigators by former special U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker earlier this month.”



House to vote Thursday on impeachment procedures - Fox News: “House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday the House will vote this week on a resolution to formalize -- and establish the parameters -- of the Trump impeachment inquiry. In a letter sent to Democratic House lawmakers, Pelosi, D-Calif., said the resolution ‘affirms the ongoing, existing investigation’ and ‘establishes the procedure’ for future investigative steps. ‘We are taking this step to eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstructing the House of Representatives,’ Pelosi said. Fox News has learned the vote will take place Thursday on the House floor. It is not an actual article of impeachment, but rather a resolution that sets process ground rules. … The White House argued Monday that the move proves Democrats have been conducting an ‘unauthorized’ inquiry.”



Pelosi looks to keep pressure on GOP with vote - The Atlantic: “The House will be on recess next week, and Democratic members will have to address the impeachment inquiry when they meet with their constituents. For lawmakers in swing districts, the fear of having to take a vote on impeachment—which drove Pelosi’s initial decision not to have one—may have given way to anxiety that the GOP’s accusation of railroading has been resonating with the public. And for most of the party, a vote shouldn’t be difficult: All but a handful of House Democrats have already come out in favor of an impeachment inquiry… Polls have shown a significant bump in support for impeachment since Pelosi announced the start of the inquiry, and it’s less of a vulnerability for Democrats. The pressure will now be on Republicans: Will those like Representatives Francis Rooney of Florida, Will Hurd of Texas, and Mark Amodei of Nevada, who have voiced concerns about Trump’s actions, back the formal opening of an inquiry?”



SESSIONS SAID TO BE CONSIDERING SENATE RETURN BID

Politico: “Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions is strongly considering jumping into the race for his old Senate seat in Alabama, according to multiple Republican sources familiar with the matter. Sessions would scramble the already crowded field of Republicans seeking to take on Democratic Sen. Doug Jones, who won a 2017 special election to fill the remainder of Sessions' term and is widely viewed as the most vulnerable senator on the ballot next year. … Sessions, 72, must decide within days whether to run: Candidates have until Nov. 8 to qualify for the ballot. Five Republicans are already in the race: Rep. Bradley Byrne, former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville, Secretary of State John Merrill, state Rep. Arnold Mooney and Roy Moore, the former state Supreme Court judge who lost the special election in 2017 amid allegations of sexual misconduct.”



North Carolina to toss GOP-drawn House map - The [Raleigh, N.C.] News & Observer: “North Carolina’s 2020 congressional elections must happen under new maps, a panel of judges ruled Monday evening, saying that the current Republican-drawn maps are unfair to many voters. The legislature must now redraw the state’s 13 U.S. House districts. The judges — two Democrats and one Republican from different parts of North Carolina — wrote that the maps show signs of ‘extreme partisan gerrymandering’ which ‘is contrary to the fundamental right of North Carolina citizens to have elections conducted freely and honestly to ascertain, fairly and truthfully, the will of the people.’ Monday’s ruling, a preliminary injunction, said the state may not hold any elections for Congress using the current maps passed in 2016. … The judges ruled that if there aren’t new maps in time for the primary elections on March 3 then they could delay all or some of the primaries until later in 2020.”

DIRTY BIRDS

Anchorage [Alaska] Daily News: “Alaska’s ravens and crows are shiny black pranksters… Rock-dropping black birds — maybe ravens, maybe crows — are accused of smashing out glass in a half-dozen vehicles parked at Soldotna’s Central Peninsula Hospital last week. Keith Randall, the hospital’s security manager, heard about the spate of broken windshields, rear windows and sunroofs and figured he was dealing with a vandalism problem. Randall quickly realized he was. But it wasn’t humans doing the damage. The evidence pointed to black birds… Off-duty nurse Cathy McDaniel was killing time in her pickup … when she heard a giant boom… McDaniel saw a rock. She saw her shattered sunroof. She tossed the rock on the ground -- and saw a black bird fly down, pick it up, and fly off with it. … The hospital posted a Facebook story about the rock-wielding birds. Several commenters shared stories of their own encounters with ravens.”

The Supreme Court ruled in the case of Janus v. AFSCME that unions could not extract what’s called an “agency fee” from non-members who happened to work in the same place a union had “exclusive representation” rights. But one group argues that in saying it was unconstitutional to force people to fund labor unions’ speech with their own money, the high court also indicated that the legitimacy of “exclusive representation” itself could be up for debate.

""The issue with regard to exclusive representation was not presented to the court in the Janus case, but the court three separate times expressed grave concerns about the constitutionality of those provisions,"" said Robert Alt, chief executive of the Buckeye Institute, a free-market think tank. He says that the move by Justice Samual Alito in crafting the Janus opinion was an ""invitation for litigants"" to bring cases challenging exclusive representation.

SUPREME COURT REJECTS CASE OF CHRISTIAN TEEN FORCED TO WRITE ISLAMIC CONVERSION PRAYER

“We took that hint and have brought multiple cases in order to raise that question up to the Supreme Court,"" he told Fox News.

Alt and the Buckeye Institute are representing Jonathan Reisman -- an economics professor at the University of Maine who was for years active as a grievance officer with his local union -- in Reisman v. Associated Faculty of the University of Maine, a case challenging state-mandated exclusive representation schemes as unconstitutional.

Reisman lost his case in the First Circuit Court of Appeals earlier this month, but Alt said his institute intends to file a petition in early January asking the Supreme Court to hear it.

Over time, Reisman grew frustrated by the local union's association with two larger labor organizations whose political speech he didn't embrace: the Maine Education Association and the National Education Association.

While Reisman says in a profile on the Buckeye Institute's website that he was happy the Supreme Court ruled in Janus he would not have to fund union activities, he argues that is not enough. Maine has a law requiring any workplace in which 50 percent of the employees vote to be represented by a union to allow that group “exclusive representation” of all employees in that bargaining unit. This means Reisman cannot negotiate the terms of his employment for himself – the union speaks for him.

“The union still has the ability to be my exclusive representative,” Reisman said in a video. “And I’m still associated with the positions that they take. That really is the problem.”

As an example, Reisman wrote in an op-ed for The Portland Press Herald in 2018: ""Most recently, the NEA issued a ‘social justice’ grant to a now-retired University of Southern Maine professor, which was used to fund a trip to Washington promoted as a protest of the Brett Kavanaugh nomination, in violation of University of Maine System political advocacy and academic policies.""

The Buckeye Institute also represents teachers in two similar cases – a professor in Minnesota and a Spanish teacher in Ohio. Those cases are pending in lower courts.

The AFUM, the MEA and the NEA didn't respond to requests for comment.

It's unclear whether the Supreme Court will take up the Reisman case, let alone whether Reisman will prevail if it does. The top court often allows legal disputes to play out in the lower courts for years before stepping in.

But the case aims to strike a blow to the model of organized labor, since exclusive representation for employees makes a union more powerful than it otherwise might be, even if it's not collecting agency fees from nonmembers.

The New Jersey chapter of AFSCME explained how exclusive representation benefits unions in an FAQ on its website after the Janus ruling.

""Exclusivity is how we stay out of a race to the bottom. When the union represents everyone in the unit, employers can’t pit worker against worker or union against union,"" it says. ""However, anti-union organizations and some unions that represent few public-sector workers have suggested that ending exclusivity would be a relief to public sector unions. They fail to understand that if non-members can be treated differently from members the employer could give non-members a better deal in the short run to entice members out of the union.""

The First Circuit, for its part, ruled earlier this month that exclusive representation does not violate public-sector workers' First Amendment rights because the union is the designated agent for the bargaining unit as a whole rather than each individual.

""Exclusive bargaining representation by a democratically selected union does not, without more, violate the right of free association on the part of dissenting non-union members of the bargaining unit,"" the court said, quoting itself in a different case from 2016.

It really turns on this issue of is it permissible … for a state by state law to appoint a group to functionally lobby on behalf of an individual against their will? ... There's no way that is permissible under the First Amendment — Robert Alt, Buckeye Institute

The Buckeye Institute is not the only group testing the legal limits of Janus. A class-action suit filed in Illinois federal court earlier this year seeks to retroactively apply the ruling to force unions to pay back the dues it collected from non-members without their consent.

Alt says these and other cases that involve compelled speech have a strong chance of succeeding with the current composition of the Supreme Court.

""The Supreme Court has taken a renewed interest in the question of compelled speech,"" he told Fox News. ""It really turns on this issue of, is it permissible … for a state by state law to appoint a group to functionally lobby on behalf of an individual against their will? And I think the answer to that question is abundantly clear. There’s no way that is permissible under the First Amendment."""
