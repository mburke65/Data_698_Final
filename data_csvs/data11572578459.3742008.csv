Mr. Sanders announced his total for the quarter just minutes after Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., said he had raised $19.1 million in the same period.

The fund-raising announcement comes as Mr. Sanders’s campaign begins a crucial phase of his presidential bid. He and his advisers had tried for months to portray the race as a battle between Mr. Sanders and Joseph R. Biden Jr., but the surge of Ms. Warren, his chief ideological rival, has scrambled that strategy. The top tier of candidates in the field has narrowed faster than his advisers expected, complicating matters: Rather than competing for the nomination with a half dozen candidates, he is essentially battling just two right now — Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren."

Their tax proposals are helping to galvanize those on the left, but their ideas will also provide fodder for Republicans eager to paint them in a general election as tax-happy and too liberal.

Polls have found widespread support for the idea of taxing wealth. A poll conducted for The New York Times by the internet research firm SurveyMonkey this summer found that two-thirds of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, backed a 2 percent tax on households worth over $50 million, which is the heart of Ms. Warren’s plan.

The proposals for a wealth tax are among a variety of ideas for collecting more tax revenue that Democratic presidential candidates have put forward. On Monday, Mr. Sanders proposed a new tax on corporations that have a huge gap between what they pay their chief executive and their median worker. Jared Bernstein, who was chief economist for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. from 2009 to 2011, said he has discussed with the Biden campaign a proposal to tax financial transactions.

On the campaign trail, Ms. Warren explains the concept of a wealth tax by putting it in familiar terms, likening it to the property taxes that many Americans pay on their homes. For the superrich, she said in South Carolina on Saturday, “how about we include in yours not only your real estate, but also your stock portfolio, the diamonds, the Rembrandt and the yacht?”

Mr. Sanders is blunt about his desire to reduce the size of America’s biggest fortunes, even highlighting how much individual billionaires would have to pay in taxes under his proposal. He said last week that he did not believe billionaires should exist in the United States.

“There’s no question to my mind that the United States is moving toward an oligarchy,” Mr. Sanders said. “This is an issue that has to be addressed, and this wealth tax begins to do that.”"

Mr. Sanders’s heart issue could prove to be a political problem for him, and it has the potential to change the dynamic of a still-fluid Democratic race. Mr. Sanders has largely avoided scrutiny of his age and his health. But he and his rivals will now be under increasing pressure to release detailed medical records as Democratic voters try to settle on the best candidate to take on President Trump, who is himself 73.

Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is 70, have all said they would release their records before the first voting starts in February.

When Mr. Sanders returns to the campaign, he may find what was already his biggest challenge — finding new converts to his mission — to be even more difficult.

“I do think this makes it harder for him to persuade new supporters to come into his column because this will at least be in the back of people’s minds,” said Erik Smith, a longtime Democratic strategist.



The setback with his health also comes amid something of a political slump for Mr. Sanders in his second run for the presidency. He has continued to raise substantial amounts of money from his dedicated supporters — on Tuesday, his campaign celebrated an impressive third-quarter fund-raising haul of $25.3 million — and has remained among the top three contenders in the primary. But he has been unable to expand his base beyond those enthusiasts. In recent weeks, he shook up his staff in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two nominating states, in an effort to jump-start his candidacy as Ms. Warren passed him in some polls."

Mr. Biden’s campaign has said he scored his best week of fund-raising since the second week of the campaign as Democrats initiated an impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump over a whistle-blower complaint claiming that Mr. Trump prodded the president of Ukraine to investigate the business dealings there of Mr. Biden’s son Hunter Biden.

Still, some Biden supporters are nervous about how the impeachment process, and any added scrutiny of Hunter Biden’s business affairs, will play out. Some have even discussed creating a super PAC, which the campaign quickly disavowed. Others see in Ms. Warren’s rise as a top rival, with Mr. Sanders in third, an opportunity for Mr. Biden to truly consolidate a donor class that has remained fractured.

Mr. Biden’s ability to attract small donors will be closely scrutinized. In the last 90 days, his campaign ranked 10th among the Democratic presidential candidates for advertising dollars on Facebook, where campaigns often prospect for new contributors. He spent less than one-quarter of what Mr. Buttigieg had spent on the platform in that time, and well less than half of what Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders had spent, according to Facebook data.

Mr. Biden told donors at a sushi restaurant in Los Angeles last week that he had nearly 670,000 donations overall with an average donation of $46, which would translate to only about $10.8 million this quarter. A Biden campaign official said the former vice president had not presented the “full picture” but declined to elaborate.

A Biden campaign official said Tuesday that the former vice president had “unequivocally’’ raised enough money to be competitive in the primary race, and that details would be released soon.

“Summer’s a little softer than spring for sure,” Mr. Buttigieg said Saturday during a campaign stop in Sparks, Nev. “But we like where we are. And the bottom line is, we have the resources to go the distance. And I think that’ll be one of the biggest things separating the campaigns.”

Mr. Schmuhl’s memo said more than 580,000 individual donors had contributed to the Buttigieg campaign since it launched in January, placing him well above likely thresholds to compete in future presidential debates. It said the campaign had raised more than $51 million since the beginning of the race, with an average donation of about $40.

Two other top tier candidates, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., have yet to release their third-quarter totals.

Ms. Sanders did not specify whether Mr. Sanders, 78, would be discharged sooner than the weekend and would remain in Las Vegas before returning home.

Dr. Brahmajee Nallamothu, an interventional cardiologist at the University of Michigan, said it is hard to read too much into Mr. Sanders’s apparently prolonged hospital stay. If a blood vessel’s anatomy is complex, he said, cardiologists might keep a patient for an extra day. But a stay of several days, he said, “is not typical unless there is an additional issue.”

Dr. Nallamothu said he had watched a video of Mr. Sanders’s event at a Las Vegas restaurant Tuesday night when the senator, looking distressed, removed his jacket and asked for a chair so he could sit down. The symptoms, Dr. Nallamothu said, suggest that Mr. Sanders might have had a small heart attack — defined as a blockage that results in some damage to the heart muscle — or almost had a small heart attack. But he does not seem to have had a major one.

With a smaller heart attack, a blood vessel is mostly blocked but a trickle of blood can still get through. If the person is sitting still, that can be enough blood to relieve symptoms. But if the person is standing and moving around — as Mr. Sanders was originally— the paucity of blood can cause chest pain and discomfort.

Now, several Democratic presidential candidates are proposing that parents who stay home to care for children be paid, too. It’s a twist on typical family policies — like paid leave, subsidized child care or the right to work part-time — all of which make it easier for parents to have jobs outside the home. Instead, this proposal would make it easier for them not to.

It’s an idea that blurs partisan lines. On the left, there have long been calls to recognize the economic value of unpaid domestic labor by paying for it. At the same time, many on the left fear that paying at-home parents — who are most often women — would reinforce unequal gender roles and set women back in the labor force.

Even before the $15 million figure was released, the Biden campaign and allies were playing down the significance of the quarterly total. One close Biden supporter pointed out the lack of traction that Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg have had among the broader electorate, as reflected in polling, and said that if money were all that mattered then Democrats would be nominating the billionaire financier Tom Steyer.

Also Thursday, Mr. Biden was asked for his thoughts on selecting a running mate.

“Look, if I could just manufacture someone out of the blue, I would very much think it’s important to have a woman, and even a woman of color, or someone of color as vice president,” he said. “But I’ve learned something different. Not different. Something else. The single most important thing you have to have as a president is someone you know is ideologically compatible with you, that you in fact share the same fundamental concerns and values.”

The Thursday fund-raiser, and the end of the fund-raising quarter, arrived at an uncertain time for Mr. Biden: The House of Representatives is pursuing an impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump amid revelations that he asked the president of Ukraine to “look into” Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden. There is no evidence that as vice president, Mr. Biden intentionally acted to aid his son’s business dealings there, and the news of Mr. Trump’s actions has outraged Democrats and signaled, to some, that the president is concerned about Mr. Biden’s candidacy.

While Mr. Biden is fiercely protective of his family, the moment has thrust the delicate subject into the national spotlight — even as the question of how voters will respond remains fluid, and some of Mr. Biden’s advisers and allies privately acknowledge the risks associated with Mr. Trump’s focus on the Bidens.

That dynamic did not stop his team from fund-raising off the developments involving Mr. Trump. The day after details of the president’s conversation came to light, the campaign tripled its daily online fund-raising average, Mr. Biden’s team said, though an adviser did not respond when asked last week whether that pace had continued.

During the final days of the fund-raising quarter, Mr. Biden spent much of his time at high-dollar fund-raisers, often attending two or even three in one day as he visited wealthy enclaves like Bel Air, Calif., and Park City, Utah. Mr. Biden has been more reliant on high-dollar donors than some of his rivals in the Democratic primary: Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have sworn off big-money fund-raisers."

Discussions of aging have been all-but-inescapable on the campaign trail. Since he entered the race, Mr. Biden has been dogged by questions about his physical fitness and condition — concerns he has tried to alleviate by bounding through parade routes and shaking dozens of hands in steamy summer weather. Mr. Sanders keeps a blistering campaign schedule that often includes multiple events in multiple cities each day. And supporters of Ms. Warren gush about her vitality, bragging about the hundreds of selfies she takes with supporters after each appearance.

“I was just amazed that when you first came out here, Senator Warren, that you ran up those steps the way that you did, and all this energy and stamina that you have,” Nikita L. Jackson, a Rock Hill, S.C., city councilwoman , said as she praised Ms. Warren to a crowd at a town hall event on Saturday.

None of the Democratic candidates have been particularly eager to delve into the details of their health. Aides to Mr. Sanders released a brief statement noting that he “was found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted,” a fairly common procedure in the United States. Like his rivals, Mr. Sanders has not yet released his medical records, though all three have vowed to do so before the Iowa caucuses in February.

With little actual medical information, even minor irregularities in how candidates appear have prompted a flurry of age-related speculation. When Mr. Sanders hit his head on the edge of a glass shower door, his campaign explained that he had received a cut requiring stitches but stressed that he did not fall. Mr. Biden appeared to be moving his mouth in a strange fashion during the last debate, which led to questions about whether he wore dentures. At Mr. Biden’s campaign events, voters question whether his verbal missteps can be attributed to his age.

Ms. Sanders did not specify whether Mr. Sanders, 78, would be discharged sooner than the weekend and would remain in Las Vegas before returning home.

Dr. Brahmajee Nallamothu, an interventional cardiologist at the University of Michigan, said it is hard to read too much into Mr. Sanders’s apparently prolonged hospital stay. If a blood vessel’s anatomy is complex, he said, cardiologists might keep a patient for an extra day. But a stay of several days, he said, “is not typical unless there is an additional issue.”

Dr. Nallamothu said he had watched a video of Mr. Sanders’s event at a Las Vegas restaurant Tuesday night when the senator, looking distressed, removed his jacket and asked for a chair so he could sit down. The symptoms, Dr. Nallamothu said, suggest that Mr. Sanders might have had a small heart attack — defined as a blockage that results in some damage to the heart muscle — or almost had a small heart attack. But he does not seem to have had a major one.

With a smaller heart attack, a blood vessel is mostly blocked but a trickle of blood can still get through. If the person is sitting still, that can be enough blood to relieve symptoms. But if the person is standing and moving around — as Mr. Sanders was originally— the paucity of blood can cause chest pain and discomfort.

In her statement, Ms. Sanders, who traveled on Wednesday to Las Vegas and is now with Mr. Sanders as he recovers, said her husband was in a buoyant mood, that doctors were “pleased” with Mr. Sanders’s progress and that he had not needed any additional procedures."

So Why the Mystery?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/us/politics/bernie-sanders-heart.html,"Until then, Mr. Sanders had not disclosed whether blood and electrocardiogram tests showed he had a heart attack. The senator and his campaign have not allowed reporters to interview his doctors, though advisers have said that Mr. Sanders would be able to appear in the next Democratic debate on Oct. 15.

With respect to release of health information, President Trump has not had a medical emergency while running for or serving in office, but he disclosed few specific laboratory test results initially in his 2016 campaign. He issued a four-paragraph letter from his personal physician stating that Mr. Trump would be “the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” Closer to the 2016 election date, Mr. Trump’s doctor offered a more conventional letter that still omitted a number of details that would be part of a customary summary of a patient’s health.

In 2018, the doctor, Harold N. Bornstein, said that Trump aides had raided his office a year earlier and taken the president’s medical files after The Times reported that the president had taken a drug for hair growth. And this year, the White House physician pronounced Mr. Trump in “very good health” although the president had gained weight and is now officially obese.

The health questions hang over Mr. Sanders in part because he would become the nation’s oldest president by far if elected. Also, given that implanting two stents in one coronary artery is a very common procedure in American hospitals, it was puzzling that for several days he did not release more details. Mr. Sanders is a private person, no doubt, but most modern-day presidents and serious candidates for the presidency have put forward details to inform the electorate after emergency health issues."

Ms. Warren’s campaign said on Friday that it had received 943,000 donations in the third quarter from 509,000 donors, and more than 300,000 of those donors gave to her presidential campaign for the first time. The average donation was $26, and Ms. Warren ended the quarter with $25.7 million in cash on hand, according to her campaign.

“Please take a moment to be proud of the movement you’re helping build ,” Roger Lau, Ms. Warren’s campaign manager, wrote in an email to supporters. “Close your eyes and picture Wall Street bankers scowling into their catered breakfast,” he suggested.

Collecting small contributions from a vast group of donors comes with a huge long-term advantage: Those donors can keep giving again and again as the campaign goes on. That is not the case for wealthy donors writing $2,800 checks to candidates — the maximum an individual can give to a campaign for the primary race.

Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders “are breaking these old political models in which rich donors can capture and control political parties,” said Stephanie Taylor, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is supporting Ms. Warren. “This is just a really revolutionary, seismic shift in American politics.”

Beating Mr. Sanders’s total for the past three months would have given another jolt of momentum to Ms. Warren’s campaign. Instead, Mr. Sanders’s status as the top fund-raiser for the quarter provides a reminder of his sizable base of support, even as other indicators like polling are less favorable.

In the long run, Mr. Sanders’s slight financial edge over Ms. Warren in the quarter is unlikely to make a major difference in the perceptions of their candidacies. Mr. Sanders entered the race having already established an enormous network of donors during his 2016 presidential campaign, and he raised slightly less in the third quarter of 2019 than he did during the same time period in 2015."

This year, the White House physician pronounced Mr. Trump in “very good health,” although the president had gained weight and is now officially obese.

Other presidents and presidential candidates have had heart trouble, though not all of it was known to the public at the time. Experts believe that President Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack that his doctor did not detect. Toward the end of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s third term and until his death in his fourth term, his White House doctor withheld the fact that he had serious heart failure. President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack near the end of his first term, and might have had a heart attack before he ran for president.

In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley damaged his presidential campaign by not disclosing that he had had a number of episodes of atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality, before he experienced one while campaigning and had to be rushed to a hospital with reporters trailing him.

Before his heart attack pulled him from the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders was polling in the top tier of the Democratic primary race with Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, and his staff has been trying to project optimism about his candidacy. But the episode has cast a shadow over his campaign just as he was attempting to reinvigorate it after a summer slump that saw his standing in some polls slip.

Hoping to reverse course, he had recently begun to focus more on his electability, arguing that he is the candidate best positioned to beat Mr. Trump in the general election.

The Sanders campaign announced this week that it had raised $25.3 million in the third quarter, placing him ahead of Ms. Warren, his chief ideological rival, by a hair and at the top of the field in fund-raising.

In a show of force, the campaign announced a $1.3 million ad buy in Iowa that it then postponed as it waited to assess the situation; the ad will now begin airing next Tuesday, and will run for two weeks as planned."

Now, several Democratic presidential candidates are proposing that parents who stay home to care for children be paid, too. It’s a twist on typical family policies — like paid leave, subsidized child care or the right to work part-time — all of which make it easier for parents to have jobs outside the home. Instead, this proposal would make it easier for them not to.

It’s an idea that blurs partisan lines. On the left, there have long been calls to recognize the economic value of unpaid domestic labor by paying for it. At the same time, many on the left fear that paying at-home parents — who are most often women — would reinforce unequal gender roles and set women back in the labor force.

On the right, proponents appreciate that the proposal supports traditional families and allows young children to be home with a parent. Yet many on the right resist the expansion of government benefits, especially without work requirements."

Even before the $15 million figure was released, the Biden campaign and allies were playing down the significance of the quarterly total. One close Biden supporter pointed out the lack of traction that Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg have had among the broader electorate, as reflected in polling, and said that if money were all that mattered then Democrats would be nominating the billionaire financier Tom Steyer.

Also Thursday, Mr. Biden was asked for his thoughts on selecting a running mate.

“Look, if I could just manufacture someone out of the blue, I would very much think it’s important to have a woman, and even a woman of color, or someone of color as vice president,” he said. “But I’ve learned something different. Not different. Something else. The single most important thing you have to have as a president is someone you know is ideologically compatible with you, that you in fact share the same fundamental concerns and values.”

The Thursday fund-raiser, and the end of the fund-raising quarter, arrived at an uncertain time for Mr. Biden: The House of Representatives is pursuing an impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump amid revelations that he asked the president of Ukraine to “look into” Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden. There is no evidence that as vice president, Mr. Biden intentionally acted to aid his son’s business dealings there, and the news of Mr. Trump’s actions has outraged Democrats and signaled, to some, that the president is concerned about Mr. Biden’s candidacy.

While Mr. Biden is fiercely protective of his family, the moment has thrust the delicate subject into the national spotlight — even as the question of how voters will respond remains fluid, and some of Mr. Biden’s advisers and allies privately acknowledge the risks associated with Mr. Trump’s focus on the Bidens.

That dynamic did not stop his team from fund-raising off the developments involving Mr. Trump. The day after details of the president’s conversation came to light, the campaign tripled its daily online fund-raising average, Mr. Biden’s team said, though an adviser did not respond when asked last week whether that pace had continued.

During the final days of the fund-raising quarter, Mr. Biden spent much of his time at high-dollar fund-raisers, often attending two or even three in one day as he visited wealthy enclaves like Bel Air, Calif., and Park City, Utah. Mr. Biden has been more reliant on high-dollar donors than some of his rivals in the Democratic primary: Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have sworn off big-money fund-raisers."

So Why the Mystery?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/us/politics/bernie-sanders-heart.html,"Until then, Mr. Sanders had not disclosed whether blood and electrocardiogram tests showed he had a heart attack. The senator and his campaign have not allowed reporters to interview his doctors, though advisers have said that Mr. Sanders would be able to appear in the next Democratic debate on Oct. 15.

With respect to release of health information, President Trump has not had a medical emergency while running for or serving in office, but he disclosed few specific laboratory test results initially in his 2016 campaign. He issued a four-paragraph letter from his personal physician stating that Mr. Trump would be “the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” Closer to the 2016 election date, Mr. Trump’s doctor offered a more conventional letter that still omitted a number of details that would be part of a customary summary of a patient’s health.

In 2018, the doctor, Harold N. Bornstein, said that Trump aides had raided his office a year earlier and taken the president’s medical files after The Times reported that the president had taken a drug for hair growth. And this year, the White House physician pronounced Mr. Trump in “very good health” although the president had gained weight and is now officially obese.

The health questions hang over Mr. Sanders in part because he would become the nation’s oldest president by far if elected. Also, given that implanting two stents in one coronary artery is a very common procedure in American hospitals, it was puzzling that for several days he did not release more details. Mr. Sanders is a private person, no doubt, but most modern-day presidents and serious candidates for the presidency have put forward details to inform the electorate after emergency health issues."

Ms. Warren’s campaign said on Friday that it had received 943,000 donations in the third quarter from 509,000 donors, and more than 300,000 of those donors gave to her presidential campaign for the first time. The average donation was $26, and Ms. Warren ended the quarter with $25.7 million in cash on hand, according to her campaign.

“Please take a moment to be proud of the movement you’re helping build ,” Roger Lau, Ms. Warren’s campaign manager, wrote in an email to supporters. “Close your eyes and picture Wall Street bankers scowling into their catered breakfast,” he suggested.

Collecting small contributions from a vast group of donors comes with a huge long-term advantage: Those donors can keep giving again and again as the campaign goes on. That is not the case for wealthy donors writing $2,800 checks to candidates — the maximum an individual can give to a campaign for the primary race.

Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders “are breaking these old political models in which rich donors can capture and control political parties,” said Stephanie Taylor, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is supporting Ms. Warren. “This is just a really revolutionary, seismic shift in American politics.”

Beating Mr. Sanders’s total for the past three months would have given another jolt of momentum to Ms. Warren’s campaign. Instead, Mr. Sanders’s status as the top fund-raiser for the quarter provides a reminder of his sizable base of support, even as other indicators like polling are less favorable.

In the long run, Mr. Sanders’s slight financial edge over Ms. Warren in the quarter is unlikely to make a major difference in the perceptions of their candidacies. Mr. Sanders entered the race having already established an enormous network of donors during his 2016 presidential campaign, and he raised slightly less in the third quarter of 2019 than he did during the same time period in 2015."

This year, the White House physician pronounced Mr. Trump in “very good health,” although the president had gained weight and is now officially obese.

Other presidents and presidential candidates have had heart trouble, though not all of it was known to the public at the time. Experts believe that President Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack that his doctor did not detect. Toward the end of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s third term and until his death in his fourth term, his White House doctor withheld the fact that he had serious heart failure. President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack near the end of his first term, and might have had a heart attack before he ran for president.

In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley damaged his presidential campaign by not disclosing that he had had a number of episodes of atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality, before he experienced one while campaigning and had to be rushed to a hospital with reporters trailing him.

Before his heart attack pulled him from the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders was polling in the top tier of the Democratic primary race with Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, and his staff has been trying to project optimism about his candidacy. But the episode has cast a shadow over his campaign just as he was attempting to reinvigorate it after a summer slump that saw his standing in some polls slip.

Hoping to reverse course, he had recently begun to focus more on his electability, arguing that he is the candidate best positioned to beat Mr. Trump in the general election.

The Sanders campaign announced this week that it had raised $25.3 million in the third quarter, placing him ahead of Ms. Warren, his chief ideological rival, by a hair and at the top of the field in fund-raising.

A health scare for Sanders

Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont had a heart attack this week, and doctors inserted two stents to open a blocked artery.

Mr. Sanders, 78, was taken to a Las Vegas hospital on Wednesday after he experienced “some chest discomfort” at an event Tuesday night. His wife, Jane Sanders, later said that he was resting comfortably and that he would participate in the next Democratic debate, on Oct. 15. The news that he’d had a heart attack was not revealed until he was discharged from the hospital on Friday.

But with Delle Donne ailing and the Sun looking at two straight home games, what seemed to many like a coronation for Delle Donne entering the series could well turn out to be the moment of ascension for Jones instead.

“One of the things that we’ve been very vocal about with our team, and a concerted effort down the stretch of the season and now into the playoffs, is getting J.J. touches,” Miller said. “Sometimes, we will get hung up on what that shot total looks like, but as long as we’re getting touches and playing through her, we know that adjustments are going to be made.”

Over the four seasons Jones has played in the W.N.B.A., her efficiency has not been in dispute. She is not merely tall, but a muscular presence inside, while her 3-point shooting is free and easy, a slingshot of a release that’s impossible to block, given her stature, and effectiveness — 38.5 percent from deep in her career. It all adds up to a career true shooting percentage of 61.1 percent, the fourth-highest in W.N.B.A. history.

And yet, for all this dominance, the Sun are built around sharing the ball and allowing different players to carry them offensively on different nights. This often manifests in unconventional ways, from Alyssa Thomas’s possessions that start with defensive rebounds and end with sleight of hand around the basket to the midrange stylings of the 5-foot-8 Courtney Williams, who makes up for her lack of height with a seemingly limitless vertical leap."

Denise Bauer, a former ambassador to Belgium, said there was an urgency in the air. “We need him to get the nomination because he’s the one who can win,” she said, adding “We are all going to try to raise every single dollar we can.”

Some donors played down the importance of the very currency that had brought them to Philadelphia in the first place for what the campaign called a “finance committee forum,” questioning, for instance, whether Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders had the other political assets needed to seriously challenge Mr. Biden. In a sign of the attendees’ significant financial firepower, Mr. Biden himself addressed the several dozen donors who came to the retreat on Saturday, rallying them for 45 minutes about the months ahead, people there said. The campaign kept the session with Mr. Biden behind closed doors, despite pledging to open his fund-raising events to reporters. The campaign said this event with Mr. Biden’s biggest bundlers was different because no money was actually raised.

On Friday afternoon, the donors received a tour of Mr. Biden’s downtown Philadelphia office before decamping to the second floor of The Continental Mid-town, a retro-style bar a few blocks away where they sported shiny “Joe 2020” pins and sipped from an open bar. On Saturday, there were a series of closed-door briefings, with updates from most of Mr. Biden’s top brass, including his campaign manager, Greg Schultz, and former chief of staff as vice president, Steve Ricchetti, about the run-up to the Iowa caucuses through Super Tuesday, including delegate math and digital tactics, according to attendees, who were asked to keep the proceedings private.

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., one of the race’s leading candidates, also once faced questions about his ability to serve in public office because of a serious medical problem. In 1988, as a 45-year-old senator from Delaware , he experienced a near fatal rupture of an aneurysm in an artery in his brain . Shortly after his emergency surgery for the aneurysm, he had a second one removed before it could burst. Because new cerebral aneurysms can develop years later in a tiny percentage of individuals, some experts suggested that Mr. Biden be examined for any new aneurysms when Barack Obama selected him as his running mate. At the time, Mr. Biden’s doctor said that he did not need further testing because he had recovered fully and done well for 20 years.

Mr. Sanders is certainly not the first candidate whose presidential campaign was disrupted by a medical emergency. In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley made an unexpected visit to a hospital in the San Francisco Bay Area for atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality, which he did not disclose until after the incident. After canceling a few events, Mr. Bradley, now 76, resumed his campaign, but he eventually dropped out of the race after losing the New Hampshire primary. A poll of New Hampshire voters revealed concern about how he had handled the disclosure of his health iss ue .

Still, M r. Sanders’s case is unusual in many respects: He is a leading candidate recovering from a heart attack at age 78 who must compete in an intensely competitive primary while also holding down a demanding job as senator . Indeed, Mr. Sanders’s disruption comes amid increased pressure to bolster voter support with strong challenges from Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, and it is unclear at what pace Mr. Sanders will carry on his campaign.

“Bernie will be scrutinized very carefully in the next month or two for his ability to come back and campaign as vigorously as he has done in the 2016 and current presidential campaigns,” said Ed Rollins, a former adviser to President Ronald Reagan. “He’ll be looked at a little differently” for things like being tired at the end of the day or stumbling in his delivery onstage, Mr. Rollins added.

“I have never known a politician or big moneyed guy or anyone who has had a first heart attack” not consider his mortality, Mr. Rollins added. Also, Mr. Sanders “surely will think about a running mate.”"

Denise Bauer, a former ambassador to Belgium, said there was an urgency in the air. “We need him to get the nomination because he’s the one who can win,” she said, adding “We are all going to try to raise every single dollar we can.”

Some donors played down the importance of the very currency that had brought them to Philadelphia in the first place for what the campaign called a “finance committee forum,” questioning, for instance, whether Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders had the other political assets needed to seriously challenge Mr. Biden. In a sign of the attendees’ significant financial firepower, Mr. Biden himself addressed the several dozen donors who came to the retreat on Saturday, rallying them for 45 minutes about the months ahead, people there said. The campaign kept the session with Mr. Biden behind closed doors, despite pledging to open his fund-raising events to reporters. The campaign said this event with Mr. Biden’s biggest bundlers was different because no money was actually raised.

On Friday afternoon, the donors received a tour of Mr. Biden’s downtown Philadelphia office before decamping to the second floor of The Continental Mid-town, a retro-style bar a few blocks away where they sported shiny “Joe 2020” pins and sipped from an open bar. On Saturday, there were a series of closed-door briefings, with updates from most of Mr. Biden’s top brass, including his campaign manager, Greg Schultz, and former chief of staff as vice president, Steve Ricchetti, about the run-up to the Iowa caucuses through Super Tuesday, including delegate math and digital tactics, according to attendees, who were asked to keep the proceedings private.

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., one of the race’s leading candidates, also once faced questions about his ability to serve in public office because of a serious medical problem. In 1988, as a 45-year-old senator from Delaware , he experienced a near fatal rupture of an aneurysm in an artery in his brain . Shortly after his emergency surgery for the aneurysm, he had a second one removed before it could burst. Because new cerebral aneurysms can develop years later in a tiny percentage of individuals, some experts suggested that Mr. Biden be examined for any new aneurysms when Barack Obama selected him as his running mate. At the time, Mr. Biden’s doctor said that he did not need further testing because he had recovered fully and done well for 20 years.

Mr. Sanders is certainly not the first candidate whose presidential campaign was disrupted by a medical emergency. In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley made an unexpected visit to a hospital in the San Francisco Bay Area for atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality, which he did not disclose until after the incident. After canceling a few events, Mr. Bradley, now 76, resumed his campaign, but he eventually dropped out of the race after losing the New Hampshire primary. A poll of New Hampshire voters revealed concern about how he had handled the disclosure of his health iss ue .

Still, M r. Sanders’s case is unusual in many respects: He is a leading candidate recovering from a heart attack at age 78 who must compete in an intensely competitive primary while also holding down a demanding job as senator . Indeed, Mr. Sanders’s disruption comes amid increased pressure to bolster voter support with strong challenges from Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, and it is unclear at what pace Mr. Sanders will carry on his campaign.

“Bernie will be scrutinized very carefully in the next month or two for his ability to come back and campaign as vigorously as he has done in the 2016 and current presidential campaigns,” said Ed Rollins, a former adviser to President Ronald Reagan. “He’ll be looked at a little differently” for things like being tired at the end of the day or stumbling in his delivery onstage, Mr. Rollins added.

“I have never known a politician or big moneyed guy or anyone who has had a first heart attack” not consider his mortality, Mr. Rollins added. Also, Mr. Sanders “surely will think about a running mate.”"

It’s: Are we going to bring out what is better in us versus what is worse in us?”

He constantly plies this theme, which deserves constant plying. For him it’s clearly more than cant, and has roots in his stint in the military, which throws diverse Americans together, endowing them with a shared purpose.

He routinely steers clear of extremes — on health care, on guns, on environmental issues — not because he lacks conviction or courage, at least not from where I’m sitting, but because extremes aren’t where the most progress is usually made or where healing is likeliest to happen. He’s a champion of the sensible. In that way, he seems much older than his age.

But, ugh, that age. My wish for a young candidate didn’t mean a 37-year-old one. There’s much wisdom in this life that’s accrued only with the passage of years, and he’d be better off — and significantly less vulnerable in a general election — if he had even five more of them.

In 2016, I visited and spent many hours with him in South Bend, then wrote a column with the headline “The First Gay President?” I was looking at least a decade into the future, after he’d extended his résumé beyond South Bend, which has only about 100,000 people.

I’d be a lot more comfortable if there were an additional zero in that population figure, if he had a better record on race, and if there weren’t quite so many elitist mile markers on his journey to this point.

And that’s where my depression sets in. He’s so very strong but so crucially weak — which is the story of the Democratic primary, whose leading candidates are all agonizingly unsafe bets.

The donation limits for the D.N.C. are actually far higher than those for direct contributions to campaigns. The D.N.C. can raise money in increments of $355,000; direct donations to a potential Warren general election committee would be limited to $2,800.

Ms. Orthman said Ms. Warren would attend D.N.C. events that are open to the press to “make sure the Democratic National Committee, state and local parties, and Democratic candidates everywhere have the resources” they need. She also said Ms. Warren was “not going to change a thing in how she runs her campaign,” including “no special access or call time with rich donors or big-dollar fund-raisers.”

Ms. Warren headlined a D.N.C. event in August, but she did not meet privately with large donors who attended. She is scheduled for another D.N.C. event next week.

The Warren campaign declined to say whether it would create a joint fund-raising committee with the D.N.C., which is traditionally a big lure for contributors who want to support candidates up and down the ballot.

There were other complications: Public outreach was weak. And in 2013, the state started an online insurance exchange under the Affordable Care Act that was plagued by technical failures, which the state struggled to fix. As the Cornell Policy Review noted in a 2017 post-mortem, the mix of higher-than-expected costs and administrative problems “fostered an atmosphere of uncertainty and distrust in the state government, turning a politically steep climb into a politically insurmountable one.”

And so, at the end of 2014, Mr. Shumlin admitted defeat. “I have learned that the limitations of state-based financing, the limitations of federal law, the limitations of our tax capacity and the sensitivity of our economy” make single-payer “unwise and untenable at this time,” he said. “The risk of economic shock is too high.”

The Vermont plan was done in by high taxes, distrust of government and lack of political support. Any effort by a Sanders administration to enact a single-payer system at a national level would probably be doomed by similar problems.

Like Mr. Shumlin, Mr. Sanders is a devout single-payer supporter who has campaigned aggressively on the idea. And like Mr. Shumlin, Mr. Sanders has so far declined to lay out a plan for fully financing his Medicare for All system.

But while some polls show majority public support for single-payer, that support declines substantially when faced with trade-offs like the elimination of most private coverage or higher taxes — two components of Mr. Sanders’s plan.

Similarly, Medicare for All supporters argue that single-payer would reduce the nation’s overall health spending. But savings are heavily predicated on the assumption that the new government-run system could pay Medicare rates, which are typically lower than those of private insurance, to providers across the board."

It’s: Are we going to bring out what is better in us versus what is worse in us?”

He constantly plies this theme, which deserves constant plying. For him it’s clearly more than cant, and has roots in his stint in the military, which throws diverse Americans together, endowing them with a shared purpose.

He routinely steers clear of extremes — on health care, on guns, on environmental issues — not because he lacks conviction or courage, at least not from where I’m sitting, but because extremes aren’t where the most progress is usually made or where healing is likeliest to happen. He’s a champion of the sensible. In that way, he seems much older than his age.

But, ugh, that age. My wish for a young candidate didn’t mean a 37-year-old one. There’s much wisdom in this life that’s accrued only with the passage of years, and he’d be better off — and significantly less vulnerable in a general election — if he had even five more of them.

In 2016, I visited and spent many hours with him in South Bend, then wrote a column with the headline “The First Gay President?” I was looking at least a decade into the future, after he’d extended his résumé beyond South Bend, which has only about 100,000 people.

I’d be a lot more comfortable if there were an additional zero in that population figure, if he had a better record on race, and if there weren’t quite so many elitist mile markers on his journey to this point.

And that’s where my depression sets in. He’s so very strong but so crucially weak — which is the story of the Democratic primary, whose leading candidates are all agonizingly unsafe bets. Without a nanosecond’s pause, I’d vote for any of them over Trump. But will enough other Americans? The stakes are enormous and reassurance is elusive."

Your political operation takes over the D.N.C. You cannot divorce in any way fund-raising for the presidential campaign and the Democratic Party.”

The donation limits for the D.N.C. are actually far higher than those for direct contributions to campaigns. The D.N.C. can raise money in increments of $355,000; direct donations to a potential Warren general election committee would be limited to $2,800.

Ms. Orthman said Ms. Warren would attend D.N.C. events that are open to the press to “make sure the Democratic National Committee, state and local parties, and Democratic candidates everywhere have the resources” they need. She also said Ms. Warren was “not going to change a thing in how she runs her campaign,” including “no special access or call time with rich donors or big-dollar fund-raisers.”

Ms. Warren headlined a D.N.C. event in August, but she did not meet privately with large donors who attended. She is scheduled for another D.N.C. event next week.

The Warren campaign declined to say whether it would create a joint fund-raising committee with the D.N.C., which is traditionally a big lure for contributors who want to support candidates up and down the ballot.

The current controversy stems from two separate but related events. The first revolves around leaked audio of Mark Zuckerberg speaking privately to employees at recent town hall meetings, where he called Senator Elizabeth Warren’s plans to break up Facebook an “existential” threat to the company and one he would fight. The second is a recent announcement by Facebook that it is exempting political figures from its policy forbidding spreading misinformation in advertisements (yes, politicians spreading false claims in their ads is just a part of the political conversation, according to Facebook).

Both developments have attracted the ire of Warren who, in a series of tweets this week, argued that the public has a right to know how Facebook “intends to use their influence in this election” and implied that Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook might be intentionally emboldening the Trump campaign by relaxing advertising rules. Fellow Democrats echoed the concerns: Seema Nanda, C.E.O. of the Democratic National Committee, told CNN that the social network’s ad policy “is a serious missed opportunity by Facebook.” At the same time, old fears that the company’s “I Voted” button, which has proved effective at boosting get-out-the-vote efforts, could give an outsize advantage to Mr. Trump are recirculating.

But Ms. Warren’s concerns miss a key point about the social network’s roles in elections.

Yes, Facebook’s willingness to let politicians lie sets a worrying precedent. And yes, lack of oversight into the platform’s decisions opens up a host of plausible election interference conspiracies. But Facebook’s essential threat to democracy isn’t that Mr. Zuckerberg will intervene on behalf of his preferred candidate — it’s more fundamental than that. Mark Zuckerberg need not intervene, because Facebook, the platform, will do so instinctively. With its algorithmic mandate of engagement over all else, Facebook has redefined what it means to be a good candidate — and provided a distinct natural advantage to those who distort the truth and seek to divide.

Few politicians have evidenced this phenomenon better than President Trump, the natural Facebook candidate. He’s light on policy but heavy on the sort of sweeping imagery that translates so easily to memes (some of his memes, like “The Wall,” eventually do become policy). Almost every iteration of his messaging is the type of polarizing content that is candy for Facebook’s algorithms."

With a crucial debate looming next week in the Democratic presidential primary, the party’s populist wing appears increasingly in control of the race — rising in the polls, stocked with cash and with only a wounded leading candidate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., standing in its way.

Several slow-building trends have converged to upend the race over the last few weeks: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s steady ascent in the polls has accelerated. Both she and Senator Bernie Sanders, a fellow progressive, have raised immense sums of money from small donors online, dominating the Democratic field and each collecting about $10 million more than Mr. Biden in the last quarter. And Mr. Biden’s numbers have gradually slipped in a way that has alarmed his supporters.

The race is far from over: All three of the top candidates — Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders — have a path to victory, and there is still time for longer-shot candidates to make a real run at the nomination. The CNN/New York Times debate in Ohio on Tuesday is likely to test Ms. Warren’s status as an emerging front-runner, subjecting her to new criticism from her fellow Democrats on matters ranging from health care policy to trade and the role of the government in overseeing the economy. Above all, she may need to allay lingering reservations about her appeal to swing voters in the general election."

Some of the new projects will preserve many or all of the units for below-market-rate renters and buyers, but critics argue there is still a mismatch with the needs of longtime residents, and competition for land is growing.

To analyze the least-accessible pockets of the five boroughs, we asked Localize.city, a housing data and listings portal, to map all the areas located at least a 15-minute walk, or roughly three-quarters of a mile, from a subway or rail station. Then they identified all of the new residential permits for buildings with at least four units that were issued in those areas, and filtered out stalled projects. Remote is a relative term, because most of these areas have some bus service, but the analysis focused on subway and rail options like the Long Island Rail Road, which often have a larger influence on property values.

There were 6,006 new apartments in the planning stages or under construction in these transit deserts through late September, according to Localize.city. That represented just 6 percent of the 97,553 new units expected in the city over the next several years, suggesting there is still plenty of underdeveloped land near train stops, in part because of recent rezoning that permits higher density building in some areas.

The neighborhoods with the most new construction at least 15 minutes away from the train were East New York in Brooklyn with 1,464 units, Astoria in Queens (1,105), Coney Island in Brooklyn (625), Forest Hills in Queens (442), and Rochdale in Queens (159). Neighborhoods in the Bronx and Staten Island also made the list.

But in seven of the 10 neighborhoods with the most new units rising in remote locations, the rate of growth in the faraway corners was as fast or faster than in more commuter-friendly parts of the neighborhood. In rapidly developing Astoria, where 44 percent of new units were in a transit desert, construction in those remote areas was growing six times faster than in the neighborhood overall."

Both developments have attracted the ire of Warren who, in a series of tweets this week, argued that the public has a right to know how Facebook “intends to use their influence in this election” and implied that Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook might be intentionally emboldening the Trump campaign by relaxing advertising rules. Fellow Democrats echoed the concerns: Seema Nanda, C.E.O. of the Democratic National Committee, told CNN that the social network’s ad policy “is a serious missed opportunity by Facebook.” At the same time, old fears that the company’s “I Voted” button, which has proved effective at boosting get-out-the-vote efforts, could give an outsize advantage to Mr. Trump are recirculating.

But Ms. Warren’s concerns miss a key point about the social network’s roles in elections.

Yes, Facebook’s willingness to let politicians lie sets a worrying precedent. And yes, lack of oversight into the platform’s decisions opens up a host of plausible election interference conspiracies. But Facebook’s essential threat to democracy isn’t that Mr. Zuckerberg will intervene on behalf of his preferred candidate — it’s more fundamental than that. Mark Zuckerberg need not intervene, because Facebook, the platform, will do so instinctively. With its algorithmic mandate of engagement over all else, Facebook has redefined what it means to be a good candidate — and provided a distinct natural advantage to those who distort the truth and seek to divide.

Few politicians have evidenced this phenomenon better than President Trump, the natural Facebook candidate. He’s light on policy but heavy on the sort of sweeping imagery that translates so easily to memes (some of his memes, like “The Wall,” eventually do become policy). Almost every iteration of his messaging is the type of polarizing content that is candy for Facebook’s algorithms."

Oct. 11, 2019

With a crucial debate looming next week in the Democratic presidential primary, the party’s populist wing appears increasingly in control of the race — rising in the polls, stocked with cash and with only a wounded leading candidate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., standing in its way.

Several slow-building trends have converged to upend the race over the last few weeks: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s steady ascent in the polls has accelerated. Both she and Senator Bernie Sanders, a fellow progressive, have raised immense sums of money from small donors online, dominating the Democratic field and each collecting about $10 million more than Mr. Biden in the last quarter. And Mr. Biden’s numbers have gradually slipped in a way that has alarmed his supporters.

The race is far from over: All three of the top candidates — Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders — have a path to victory, and there is still time for longer-shot candidates to make a real run at the nomination. The CNN/New York Times debate in Ohio on Tuesday is likely to test Ms. Warren’s status as an emerging front-runner, subjecting her to new criticism from her fellow Democrats on matters ranging from health care policy to trade and the role of the government in overseeing the economy. Above all, she may need to allay lingering reservations about her appeal to swing voters in the general election."

Part of that, he said, is the impossibility of a deeply substantive debate among 10 people, which is how many were onstage for each of the June, July and September debates. The coming debate will have 12 people onstage.

And timidity won’t do. “Trump will be well funded and ferocious,” Kerrey told me. “If a Democratic candidate wilts under the warm attention and criticism of another Democrat, they will not be able to stand up to Trump.” And if that criticism goes too far, bleeding into gratuitous nastiness, “the audience will discipline them,” he said. He mentioned Julián Castro’s obvious insinuation in the debate last month that Biden was in serious cognitive decline.

That went too far. It was counterproductive, because it didn’t bring to light something about a candidate that wasn’t accessible to voters. That was true as well of Eric Swalwell’s “pass the torch” hectoring of Biden, in a June debate, as a politician who was overstaying his welcome. Voters know that Biden is 76 and has spent more than four decades of his life in public office. Swalwell wasn’t exposing some secret that had been swept under the rug; he was just stamping his feet.

Many anxious, Trump-horrified Democrats take the view that the candidates should tread lightly on one another. “When we know that President Trump will be spending his money to discourage Democratic turnout more explicitly and underhandedly than in any other modern campaign, why would we want any candidate to spend time persuading Democrats of how bad other Democrats are?” asked Jack Markell, the former governor of Delaware. “The difference between all of the Democratic candidates is dwarfed by the difference between the Democratic candidates collectively and President Trump.”

Many of the readers who write to me agree with him or go even further: They want to see, hear and revel in nothing but loving encomiums about Democrats vying for the White House. Some of them believe that Hillary Clinton was badly hurt by her battle with Sanders in the last Democratic primary, and that we’re where we are as a result.

But her wounds would have mattered less if Sanders had rallied more enthusiastically to her side once she’d won the nomination. I urge the losers this time around to get in line pronto. And I think it’s extremely risky to spare the next nominee the sort of tough examination that will let us know if we’ve elevated the most broadly appealing, durable, fearsome Trump slayer.

The stakes could hardly be higher. Every day, new revelations about the Ukraine sordidness come to light. Every day, the president acts in impulsive, imprudent, unhinged ways. Maybe that means that any Democrat can beat him. But I’m a bit of a pessimist and cautious to a fault. I think it means that we cannot afford to pick the wrong person."

Some of the new projects will preserve many or all of the units for below-market-rate renters and buyers, but critics argue there is still a mismatch with the needs of longtime residents, and competition for land is growing.

To analyze the least-accessible pockets of the five boroughs, we asked Localize.city, a housing data and listings portal, to map all the areas located at least a 15-minute walk, or roughly three-quarters of a mile, from a subway or rail station. Then they identified all of the new residential permits for buildings with at least four units that were issued in those areas, and filtered out stalled projects. Remote is a relative term, because most of these areas have some bus service, but the analysis focused on subway and rail options like the Long Island Rail Road, which often have a larger influence on property values.

There were 6,006 new apartments in the planning stages or under construction in these transit deserts through late September, according to Localize.city. That represented just 6 percent of the 97,553 new units expected in the city over the next several years, suggesting there is still plenty of underdeveloped land near train stops, in part because of recent rezoning that permits higher density building in some areas.

The neighborhoods with the most new construction at least 15 minutes away from the train were East New York in Brooklyn with 1,464 units, Astoria in Queens (1,105), Coney Island in Brooklyn (625), Forest Hills in Queens (442), and Rochdale in Queens (159). Neighborhoods in the Bronx and Staten Island also made the list.

But in seven of the 10 neighborhoods with the most new units rising in remote locations, the rate of growth in the faraway corners was as fast or faster than in more commuter-friendly parts of the neighborhood. In rapidly developing Astoria, where 44 percent of new units were in a transit desert, construction in those remote areas was growing six times faster than in the neighborhood overall."

The petition asked the justices to decide whether “faithless electors” were free to disregard pledges they made to vote for their own parties’ candidates. It urged the court to act quickly. “This case permits the court to issue a decision outside of the white-hot scrutiny of a contested presidential election,” the petition said.

Ms. Warren’s surge in the polls has finally reached the point where it has become problematic for Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders. Both men have signaled that attacks could be coming, with Mr. Sanders drawing a pretty sharp contrast over the weekend.

But there are signs he may pivot to a more aggressive tack Tuesday night in hopes of expanding his support. In recent weeks, he has nudged Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders on health care and has been in something of a sniper fight with former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas.

There have been plenty of signs that the two young guns in the race may be headed for a shootout at the Otterbein University Corral. The question is whether that will be enough for either to make a mark.

Does anyone else break out of the pack?

Perhaps most of all, anxious Democratic leaders are looking to the former vice president for a sign on the debate stage that all of this is not coming too late in this campaign to make a difference — to quash the undercurrent of doubt among some Democratic strategists, activists, donors a nd voters that Mr. Biden is really ready for a general-election fight against a president prepared to scorch and smear his way to a second term.

Note: Facebook ad spending data from March 24 to Oct. 5. | Sources: Bully Pulpit Interactive; Facebook

When it comes to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s Facebook ads, the odds are overwhelming that people seeing them were born before 1975. For Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the opposite is true: People born in 1975 or after are more than twice as likely to see his Facebook ads than those born earlier. A gender split is clear, too: About half of Mr. Sanders’s audience are men, while about two-thirds of Mr. Biden’s are women.

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, more or less, splits the difference between them. She has targeted a Facebook audience that more closely mirrors the projected universe of likely Democratic primary voters in 2020: more women than men (though not by as much as Mr. Biden), leaning older more than younger (but again, not by as much as Mr. Biden).

Collectively, the 19 current Democratic candidates for president have poured nearly $32 million into Facebook ads this year — more money than they have spent so far on television ads, a striking measure of the social network's ever-rising influence in politics. The heavy spending on Facebook comes even as leading party officials have raised alarms about the site’s role in American democracy.

Ms. Warren sparred with Facebook in recent days over the company’s willingness to run false ads. She has been a heavy spender nonetheless, pouring $172,000 into the site over the seven most recent days records are available.

The advertising decisions that each campaign makes on one of the Internet’s biggest platforms offer an almost unparalleled window into their political priorities and strategies, illuminating their core supporters and providing a glimpse into their potential coalitions. The spending patterns reveal not just who the campaigns are targeting but where.

The 2020 race marks the first presidential campaign where Facebook is publicly publishing who is buying ads — and whom they are targeting. This story is based on Facebook data compiled and analyzed by Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic consultancy. Its database includes estimates of which gender and age group every candidate has targeted since March but not does not include race or ethnicity, which Facebook does not explicitly allow campaigns to use for targeted ads.

Because campaigns receive so much real-time feedback from Facebook, they are able to precisely hone their audiences.

“You can prioritize toward people taking the action you want them to take,” said Alex Kellner, a Democratic strategist at Bully Pulpit. “Facebook helps you optimize toward the outcome you want.”

Aside from Mr. Sanders and Mr. Yang, candidates are mostly reaching out to older voters.

Note: Includes only spending where gender is identified.

Among the leading candidates, Mr. Sanders targets a younger and more male audience on Facebook. That mirrors his support in polls, which regularly show him strongest among young voters, and performing better among men than women.

“There’s a reason why they’re called ‘Bernie Bros,’” said Jefrey Pollock, a Democratic pollster who formerly advised Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s campaign. “Nothing about him targeting younger men is surprising to me.”

One of the most striking findings of the Facebook advertising data is just how little Mr. Biden is spending to reach the youngest generation of voters. Less than one half of 1 percent of Mr. Biden’s Facebook ad buys have targeted users born in 1995 or later. That was the smallest share — and smallest dollar amount — that any of the 11 other candidates who will be on the debate stage Tuesday spent for any age segment.

Mr. Biden spent less than $12,000 targeting voters younger than 25 through the beginning of October. Mr. Sanders spent nearly half a million dollars targeting the same age group, according to Bully Pulpit.

Emily Williams, a Democratic digital strategist who worked on Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign, said Mr. Biden’s lack of spending on young voters was a cause for concern. “It says to me that they’re struggling to break through with younger voters,” she said, “and I hope it doesn’t mean they’ve given up on younger voters.”

Mr. Biden’s bread and butter was older women: Fifty-five percent of his entire Facebook ad budget was devoted to women 45 or older, including some ads last month about Medicare.

It makes sense that the demographic groups targeted by the leading candidates look a lot like their existing supporters, digital strategists said, because much of the advertising so far has been seeking out new donors. A campaign’s best bet is serving ads to its base.

Still, the degree to which Facebook advertising aligns with polling can be almost eerie.

In a Quinnipiac poll last week, Mr. Biden led the field by a wide margin among voters who were at least 65 years old — the same segment he tops in Facebook ad spending. In the same survey, Mr. Sanders dominated among those 18 to 34 years old — where Mr. Sanders dominates in spending. Ms. Warren came in second in the poll among both extreme ends of the age spectrum, while she led among voters 35 to 65 years old.

On Facebook, Ms. Warren’s share of spending fell in between Mr. Sanders’s and Mr. Biden’s for every age segment.

Her spending splits were closely aligned with those of Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whose spending skewed slightly younger and more male. The age and gender groups targeted by the billionaire Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July and has quickly outspent all his rivals, was similar to Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren.

“A new generation of leadership” ad from Mr. Buttigieg’s campaign targets older women. Source: Facebook

A majority of Mr. Buttigieg’s Facebook spending has gone to those aged 45 years and above, despite running as a candidate for a “new generation,” a phrase featured in some of his ads. (Mr. Buttigieg wrote in his autobiography that back in his first run for mayor as a 29-year-old, older voters were more likely to see his youth as a positive.)

Candidates’ ad spending largely skews female.

Almost all of the candidates in the debate on Tuesday are advertising to a majority-female audience on Facebook. But the campaign most lopsidedly targeting women on Facebook is not one of the four female candidates at the debate, but Julián Castro, the former federal housing secretary. Jennifer Fiore, a senior adviser to Mr. Castro, was not surprised by that fact.

She noted that Mr. Castro’s campaign manager and other top strategists are women and that Mr. Castro has made his mother a big part of his pitch, featuring her in video ads on Facebook earlier this year. (Of late, the campaign has also run Facebook ads with pictures of puppies, touting that Mr. Castro would “make animal abuse a federal crime.”)

“We’re targeting women because women are responding,” Ms. Fiore said.

That self-reinforcing truism is a feature across the platform: Operatives said that Facebook’s formulas encourage advertisers to double-down on whatever demographic groups are already clicking, driving those candidates with older bases to target ever older audiences, and vice versa.

That, for instance, is how Andrew Yang, the former tech executive, is targeting an overwhelmingly male and young audience. (Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii skews slightly more male but she is spending a fraction of what Mr. Yang is.)

“The Facebook algorithm optimizes for people who are taking action,” said Eric Ming, the director of paid media for the Yang campaign, explaining that Mr. Yang’s demographics are younger and more male because that is where his message is resonating. The ads also often feature cartoon character versions of the candidate.

Digital strategists describe three phases to online advertising in campaigns. The first is acquiring new donors and supporters. The second is persuading undecided voters. The third is getting people out to vote.

For the most part, campaigns have been focused on the first phase. But some have begun to invest in persuasion — and it’s visible in their geographic splits.

Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Steyer are dominant in the first four voting states.

Note: Data from Sept. 1 to Oct. 5. | Source: Bully Pulpit Interactive

For Senator Kamala Harris of California, her biggest states for advertising in the spring were those with the biggest populations: California, New York, Texas and Florida. But in July, she shifted. Her biggest state for Facebook advertising in each of the last three months has been Iowa, a shift made in spending priorities long before she publicly announced her “pivot” to focus on that state’s leadoff caucuses.

In September, for the first time, South Carolina jumped up to one of her biggest spending states. That month, she spent $52,000 there on Facebook, second to Mr. Steyer.

Mr. Buttigieg has been the biggest spender on Facebook nationally, besides Mr. Steyer and his virtually unlimited budget. Mr. Buttigieg’s dominance is particularly apparent in the opening states of Iowa and New Hampshire. In September, Mr. Buttigieg was the top spender in both states by a wide margin. In fact, he spent more than all his rivals, other than Mr. Steyer, combined.

As the Democrats have focused on the critical primary contests, President Trump has flooded Facebook with messaging aimed at the general election. In the last month, he spent more than $700,000 on Facebook ads just in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida — four swing states he narrowly carried in 2016.

“Danger, danger, danger!” said Betsy Hoover, who was the director of digital organizing for Mr. Obama’s re-election campaign and is unaligned in the 2020 primary.

Ms. Hoover said she worries that Democrats are “focusing on the coasts or early states — none of which matter in the general,” while Mr. Trump is delivering his message to key voters.

“We are running a primary strategy and Trump is running a general election strategy,” she said, “And that’s terrifying.”"

Last week, lawyers for Mr. Epstein’s estate asked a judge in the Virgin Islands to allow the payment of $90,000 in fees to a New York law firm that is defending it against a half-dozen lawsuits filed by some of the financier’s alleged victims. The week before, it sent lawyers from another firm to court against the State of New Mexico over public grazing rights for livestock at Zorro Ranch, the nearly 10,000-acre property Mr. Epstein owned outside Santa Fe.

Legal maneuvering is not unusual when wealthy estates are involved — Mr. Epstein’s assets were estimated at more than $577 million — but the complicated court actions may have only just begun. Lawyers for some accusers have named dozens of companies Mr. Epstein was associated with as defendants.

The firm defending the estate against Mr. Epstein’s accusers, Troutman Sanders, billed for one conversation on Aug. 10, after Mr. Epstein was found dead in a Manhattan jail cell while he awaited trial on sex-trafficking charges.

The service, AMC Theaters On Demand, will offer about 2,000 films for sale or rent after their theatrical runs, just as iTunes, Amazon and other video-on-demand retailers do.

The movie theater industry has long been at odds with online video. Why trek to theaters if thousands of movies are available at the click of a button at home or on your phone?

Ms. Warren’s surge in the polls has finally reached the point where it has become problematic for Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders. Both men have signaled that attacks could be coming, with Mr. Sanders drawing a pretty sharp contrast over the weekend.

There is a similar lack of consensus among the Democratic candidates on whether to force all gun owners to register their weapons in a national database. Democratic politicians long dismissed the idea of a gun registry as a fear-mongering tactic from the National Rifle Association, but it now enjoys broad support from the public: 62 percent of Americans back the idea, including 85 percent of Democrats.

Most candidates now favor establishing a registry, though some — including Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. — do not. Others, like Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, say it should apply only to owners of assault weapons.

Climate Change









Democratic voters widely believe that climate change represents an international emergency — 84 percent said so in the August Quinnipiac poll — and roughly nine in 10 think the United States is not doing enough to address global warming.

All the major Democratic candidates have expressed support for the Green New Deal, though some have been more guarded than others. All five senators who will debate Tuesday night co-sponsored the bill. Mr. Buttigieg has simply called it “the right beginning,” while Mr. Biden’s campaign website endorses it as a “crucial framework.”

But the Green New Deal enjoys broad support from the American public, with 63 percent of respondents to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll in July saying they like the idea of investing government money to fund sustainable infrastructure projects and green jobs.

Perhaps most of all, anxious Democratic leaders are looking to the former vice president for a sign on the debate stage that all of this is not coming too late in this campaign to make a difference — to quash the undercurrent of doubt among some Democratic strategists, activists, donors a nd voters that Mr. Biden is really ready for a general-election fight against a president prepared to scorch and smear his way to a second term.

Elizabeth Warren. Swing voters exist, and they are likely to decide the 2020 election, much as they played a decisive role in 2016 and 2018. So far, Warren has not worried much about appealing to them. Now that she’s the front-runner, can she begin to signal to Democrats that she wants to be ruthless about beating President Trump?

Joe Biden. He has yet to seem sharp for an entire debate. Can he break that streak and alleviate concerns about his ability to withstand a long, vicious campaign? I’m more interested in that than the narrow questions of how he responds to Trump’s false smears against his family.

Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. They are the best-positioned candidates to benefit from Biden’s uneven campaign and win over more moderate Democrats. Can any of the three make an explicit case: I’m stronger than Biden and more electable than Warren?"

Note: Facebook ad spending data from March 24 to Oct. 5. | Sources: Bully Pulpit Interactive; Facebook

When it comes to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s Facebook ads, the odds are overwhelming that people seeing them were born before 1975. For Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the opposite is true: People born in 1975 or after are more than twice as likely to see his Facebook ads than those born earlier. A gender split is clear, too: About half of Mr. Sanders’s audience are men, while about two-thirds of Mr. Biden’s are women.

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, more or less, splits the difference between them. She has targeted a Facebook audience that more closely mirrors the projected universe of likely Democratic primary voters in 2020: more women than men (though not by as much as Mr. Biden), leaning older more than younger (but again, not by as much as Mr. Biden).

Collectively, the 19 current Democratic candidates for president have poured nearly $32 million into Facebook ads this year — more money than they have spent so far on television ads, a striking measure of the social network's ever-rising influence in politics. The heavy spending on Facebook comes even as leading party officials have raised alarms about the site’s role in American democracy.

Ms. Warren sparred with Facebook in recent days over the company’s willingness to run false ads. She has been a heavy spender nonetheless, pouring $172,000 into the site over the seven most recent days records are available.

The advertising decisions that each campaign makes on one of the Internet’s biggest platforms offer an almost unparalleled window into their political priorities and strategies, illuminating their core supporters and providing a glimpse into their potential coalitions. The spending patterns reveal not just who the campaigns are targeting but where.

The 2020 race marks the first presidential campaign where Facebook is publicly publishing who is buying ads — and whom they are targeting. This story is based on Facebook data compiled and analyzed by Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic consultancy. Its database includes estimates of which gender and age group every candidate has targeted since March but not does not include race or ethnicity, which Facebook does not explicitly allow campaigns to use for targeted ads.

Because campaigns receive so much real-time feedback from Facebook, they are able to precisely hone their audiences.

“You can prioritize toward people taking the action you want them to take,” said Alex Kellner, a Democratic strategist at Bully Pulpit. “Facebook helps you optimize toward the outcome you want.”

Aside from Mr. Sanders and Mr. Yang, candidates are mostly reaching out to older voters.

Note: Includes only spending where gender is identified.

Among the leading candidates, Mr. Sanders targets a younger and more male audience on Facebook. That mirrors his support in polls, which regularly show him strongest among young voters, and performing better among men than women.

“There’s a reason why they’re called ‘Bernie Bros,’” said Jefrey Pollock, a Democratic pollster who formerly advised Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s campaign. “Nothing about him targeting younger men is surprising to me.”

One of the most striking findings of the Facebook advertising data is just how little Mr. Biden is spending to reach the youngest generation of voters. Less than one half of 1 percent of Mr. Biden’s Facebook ad buys have targeted users born in 1995 or later. That was the smallest share — and smallest dollar amount — that any of the 11 other candidates who will be on the debate stage Tuesday spent for any age segment.

Mr. Biden spent less than $12,000 targeting voters younger than 25 through the beginning of October. Mr. Sanders spent nearly half a million dollars targeting the same age group, according to Bully Pulpit.

Emily Williams, a Democratic digital strategist who worked on Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign, said Mr. Biden’s lack of spending on young voters was a cause for concern. “It says to me that they’re struggling to break through with younger voters,” she said, “and I hope it doesn’t mean they’ve given up on younger voters.”

Mr. Biden’s bread and butter was older women: Fifty-five percent of his entire Facebook ad budget was devoted to women 45 or older, including some ads last month about Medicare.

The targeted audience for this Biden ad on Medicare was overwhelmingly women 65 or older. Source: Facebook

It makes sense that the demographic groups targeted by the leading candidates look a lot like their existing supporters, digital strategists said, because much of the advertising so far has been seeking out new donors. A campaign’s best bet is serving ads to its base.

Still, the degree to which Facebook advertising aligns with polling can be almost eerie.

In a Quinnipiac poll last week, Mr. Biden led the field by a wide margin among voters who were at least 65 years old — the same segment he tops in Facebook ad spending. In the same survey, Mr. Sanders dominated among those 18 to 34 years old — where Mr. Sanders dominates in spending. Ms. Warren came in second in the poll among both extreme ends of the age spectrum, while she led among voters 35 to 65 years old.

On Facebook, Ms. Warren’s share of spending fell in between Mr. Sanders’s and Mr. Biden’s for every age segment.

Her spending splits were closely aligned with those of Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whose spending skewed slightly younger and more male. The age and gender groups targeted by the billionaire Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July and has quickly outspent all his rivals, was similar to Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren.

“A new generation of leadership” ad from Mr. Buttigieg’s campaign targets older women. Source: Facebook

A majority of Mr. Buttigieg’s Facebook spending has gone to those aged 45 years and above, despite running as a candidate for a “new generation,” a phrase featured in some of his ads. (Mr. Buttigieg wrote in his autobiography that back in his first run for mayor as a 29-year-old, older voters were more likely to see his youth as a positive.)

Candidates’ ad spending largely skews female.

Almost all of the candidates in the debate on Tuesday are advertising to a majority-female audience on Facebook. But the campaign most lopsidedly targeting women on Facebook is not one of the four female candidates at the debate, but Julián Castro, the former federal housing secretary. Jennifer Fiore, a senior adviser to Mr. Castro, was not surprised by that fact.

She noted that Mr. Castro’s campaign manager and other top strategists are women and that Mr. Castro has made his mother a big part of his pitch, featuring her in video ads on Facebook earlier this year. (Of late, the campaign has also run Facebook ads with pictures of puppies, touting that Mr. Castro would “make animal abuse a federal crime.”)

“We’re targeting women because women are responding,” Ms. Fiore said.

That self-reinforcing truism is a feature across the platform: Operatives said that Facebook’s formulas encourage advertisers to double-down on whatever demographic groups are already clicking, driving those candidates with older bases to target ever older audiences, and vice versa.

That, for instance, is how Andrew Yang, the former tech executive, is targeting an overwhelmingly male and young audience. (Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii skews slightly more male but she is spending a fraction of what Mr. Yang is.)

“The Facebook algorithm optimizes for people who are taking action,” said Eric Ming, the director of paid media for the Yang campaign, explaining that Mr. Yang’s demographics are younger and more male because that is where his message is resonating. The ads also often feature cartoon character versions of the candidate.

Digital strategists describe three phases to online advertising in campaigns. The first is acquiring new donors and supporters. The second is persuading undecided voters. The third is getting people out to vote.

For the most part, campaigns have been focused on the first phase. But some have begun to invest in persuasion — and it’s visible in their geographic splits.

Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Steyer are dominant in the first four voting states.

Note: Data from Sept. 1 to Oct. 5. | Source: Bully Pulpit Interactive

For Senator Kamala Harris of California, her biggest states for advertising in the spring were those with the biggest populations: California, New York, Texas and Florida. But in July, she shifted. Her biggest state for Facebook advertising in each of the last three months has been Iowa, a shift made in spending priorities long before she publicly announced her “pivot” to focus on that state’s leadoff caucuses.

In September, for the first time, South Carolina jumped up to one of her biggest spending states. That month, she spent $52,000 there on Facebook, second to Mr. Steyer.

Mr. Buttigieg has been the biggest spender on Facebook nationally, besides Mr. Steyer and his virtually unlimited budget. Mr. Buttigieg’s dominance is particularly apparent in the opening states of Iowa and New Hampshire. In September, Mr. Buttigieg was the top spender in both states by a wide margin. In fact, he spent more than all his rivals, other than Mr. Steyer, combined.

As the Democrats have focused on the critical primary contests, President Trump has flooded Facebook with messaging aimed at the general election. In the last month, he spent more than $700,000 on Facebook ads just in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida — four swing states he narrowly carried in 2016.

“Danger, danger, danger!” said Betsy Hoover, who was the director of digital organizing for Mr. Obama’s re-election campaign and is unaligned in the 2020 primary.

Ms. Hoover said she worries that Democrats are “focusing on the coasts or early states — none of which matter in the general,” while Mr. Trump is delivering his message to key voters.

“We are running a primary strategy and Trump is running a general election strategy,” she said, “And that’s terrifying.”"

Last week, lawyers for Mr. Epstein’s estate asked a judge in the Virgin Islands to allow the payment of $90,000 in fees to a New York law firm that is defending it against a half-dozen lawsuits filed by some of the financier’s alleged victims. The week before, it sent lawyers from another firm to court against the State of New Mexico over public grazing rights for livestock at Zorro Ranch, the nearly 10,000-acre property Mr. Epstein owned outside Santa Fe.

Legal maneuvering is not unusual when wealthy estates are involved — Mr. Epstein’s assets were estimated at more than $577 million — but the complicated court actions may have only just begun. Lawyers for some accusers have named dozens of companies Mr. Epstein was associated with as defendants.

The firm defending the estate against Mr. Epstein’s accusers, Troutman Sanders, billed for one conversation on Aug. 10, after Mr. Epstein was found dead in a Manhattan jail cell while he awaited trial on sex-trafficking charges.

The service, AMC Theaters On Demand, will offer about 2,000 films for sale or rent after their theatrical runs, just as iTunes, Amazon and other video-on-demand retailers do.

The movie theater industry has long been at odds with online video. Why trek to theaters if thousands of movies are available at the click of a button at home or on your phone? Sure, new films do not arrive on V.O.D. until they have played in theaters for an exclusive period of about 90 days. But that “windowing” practice, many analysts believe, will become untenable as streaming services like Netflix gain clout.

That dynamic will be on display Tuesday night less than 15 miles from O.S.U., when the candidates gather for the fourth primary debate at Otterbein University in Westerville.

Two top candidates, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have successfully pushed the primary conversation to the left. The D.S.A. saw drastic growth in its membership when Mr. Sanders, himself a democratic socialist, ran for president in 2016, and there are now nearly 60,000 members across the country. (Ms. Warren, who has pulled ahead of Mr. Sanders in polling and is a leading candidate for the nomination, backs many of the same progressive priorities as Mr. Sanders, but has also said she is “a capitalist to my bones.”)"

That’s how the contenders for the party’s nomination framed the recent withdrawal of American troops from northern Syria under President Trump, who they said during Tuesday night’s debate had created turmoil with his impulsive foreign policy decision making.

“It’s been the most shameful thing any president has done in modern history in terms of foreign policy,” former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said.

While Democrats have been consumed with the Trump administration’s dealings with Russia and Ukraine, the emerging foreign policy crisis in Syria presented a delicate test for the party’s presidential hopefuls on the debate stage.

It followed Mr. Trump’s decision this month to withdraw American troops from northern Syria, one that has been sharply criticized by Republicans and now Democrats, who said it would endanger Kurdish allies in the region. Mr. Trump said he was trying to “end the endless wars.”"

In the first exchange, Ms. Warren, who is from Massachusetts, was asked repeatedly how she would pay for “Medicare for all” and insisted that costs would not increase for middle-class Americans. But she would not say outright that taxes would or would not increase.

Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who has championed a single-payer system, said taxes would go up for “virtually everybody.” But he added that the tax increase would be substantially less than what people currently pay for premiums and out-of-pocket health care expenses.

“At least Bernie is being honest here, and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,” Ms. Klobuchar, of Minnesota, said after his comments."

Biden Jr. escalated his criticism of his most formidable rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, suggesting that she was not being forthright about the costs of her far-reaching policy proposals and questioning her “credibility.”

Mr. Biden zeroed in on Ms. Warren’s refusal to say if she would raise taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for “Medicare for all,” a single-payer health care system that would all but eliminate private health insurance. While other candidates are pouncing on that issue as well, Mr. Biden is under particular pressure because Ms. Warren has passed him in some national and early-state polls and joined him as a front-runner, a status he held alone for months.

“It’s fascinating that the person who has a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential issue in this election in the minds of the American people across the board,” Mr. Biden said, addressing reporters on a cold, gray afternoon outside a union electrical trade center."

“It’s not lost on people that many of these candidates were actually on the record supporting impeachment before anyone was even talking about Ukraine,” said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and former Trump White House official.

The debate, held outside Columbus, Ohio, allowed Republicans to try to make their case in a state that Mr. Trump won by eight percentage points in 2016 and has many of the middle-class, blue-collar voters that he hopes to turn out again in next year’s election. To underscore the point, the Trump campaign took out a full-page ad in the Columbus Dispatch on Tuesday that blared, “Democrats Will Kill Ohio Jobs … President Trump’s Fighting for the Economy.”

The president remains historically unpopular, however. The Gallup presidential approval poll has measured public support for his job performance at below 50 percent for his entire presidency. To overcome this skepticism, Republicans have attempted to define the Democrats as out of touch and too far to the left of where most Americans’ views are. Some of the Democratic candidates, like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., hold moderate and liberal views, while Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont are generally more progressive.

Senator Marco Rubio of Florida on Wednesday expressed the kind of binary argument that Republicans hope prevails on voters. “Last night’s debate was a reminder that while you may not always agree with everything Trump says or does, the leading alternatives to Trump mock people with traditional beliefs & support socialism, gun confiscation & free government funded health care for unlawful immigrants,” he wrote on Twitter.

With Ms. Warren the target of sustained attacks from the other Democrats onstage, Mr. Trump and his Republican allies moved to frame the race around the question of whether voters want a strongly liberal president and government in 2021.

On Tuesday night, after Mr. Sanders picked up the support of two high-profile liberals in the House Democratic caucus — Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar — Republicans jumped at the chance to make them a focal point in the morning-after debate analysis. The two freshmen are a favorite target of conservatives, who have caricatured them as the true leaders of their party."

She then dwelled on a description of how she would pull back differently, and more skillfully, than Mr. Trump’s rapid and chaotic retreat in the past week.

Mr. Biden, the only one of the candidates with a long record in foreign issues, declined — twice — to answer a question about whether he would reinsert the American troops that have been withdrawn from northern Syria. Instead, he talked about protecting the forces still in the country, saying he would give them air cover and “make it clear they’re not going anywhere.”

He then turned to Mr. Trump’s abandonment of the Kurds, America’s longtime ally in fighting ISIS, shouting: “This is shameful! Shameful what this man has done.”

Only Mayor Pete Buttigieg of Indiana, who served in Afghanistan, made the distinction between ending large combat operations and keeping “a small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities” on the ground, especially in Syria.

Those forces, he argued, “were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria” and “the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS.” It is a distinction Mr. Trump, and many of those seeking to run against him on the Democratic ticket, have passed by.

The exchanges on Syria, followed by a parallel discussion of how to contain Russia’s increasing aggressiveness, underscored one of the oddities of the 2020 election season: Faced with a Republican president who has envisioned a far more isolationist approach to American power, the Democrats are sounding like interventionist Republicans of just a few years ago.

When Mitt Romney ran against President Barack Obama in 2012, he called Russia the “No. 1 geopolitical foe” facing the United States and argued that containing Mr. Putin would be his top priority. That led Mr. Obama, with a laugh, to respond: “The 1980s, they’re now calling to ask for their foreign policy back,” an effort to paint Mr. Romney as a cold warrior who did not realize that era had passed."

But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists and consultants from both parties.

Here is a sampling of their reactions.

Warren took fire from all sides

The strategists agreed on one thing: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s new front-runner status was clear, because she was everyone else’s biggest target. But they were divided on how well she handled the attacks.

“Warren took almost everyone’s best punch there & came away basically unscathed.” — Jesse Lehrich, former foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton “Heading into this debate as a frontrunner, she did not seem ready for the incoming.” — Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and former Democratic National Committee spokesman “This is the @ewarren debate. You might be happy or sad about it, but she’s the one who is setting the tone and she’s the reference point for most of the other candidates. That happens to the frontrunner.” — Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics

Buttigieg stood out …

Several consultants said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., had successfully set himself up as an alternative for moderate Democrats uneasy with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They particularly liked his responses on foreign policy, which he framed in terms of his own experience in the military.

“Very strong, passionate and compelling condemnation of @realDonaldTrump betrayal of Kurds from Northern Syria by @PeteButtigieg. Owning this discussion.” — David Axelrod, former chief strategist for Barack Obama “I am impressed with Buttigieg on foreign policy. Like Biden, he really shines and opens up when he talks about FP.” — Jess Morales Rocketto, political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance “This has been @PeteButtigieg’s best #DemDebate performance so far. While other candidates tried to out-left and anti-Trump each other, Mayor Pete came across as reasonable and rational.” — Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster

… and so did Klobuchar

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota received similarly positive reviews, with strategists arguing that she and Mr. Buttigieg in the middle against Ms. Warren on the left was the biggest dynamic of the night.

“@amyklobuchar performance tonight will resonate with moderate Democrats who are tired of being told that they are sellouts if they don’t subscribe to most left views. It’s a theme that’s cut across all her answers tonight & why she is having a good night.” — Jennifer Palmieri, former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama “With 11 other people on stage, you don’t get a lot of opportunities to make an impression. But she’s finding them, using each one to stand out and draw a contrast.” — Mo Elleithee “Every time Amy Klobuchar speaks she says something sensible. Not sure that makes her electable, but it’s nice to hear.” — Joe Lockhart, former spokesman for President Bill Clinton

Sanders was reassuring

After his heart attack two weeks ago, Senator Bernie Sanders badly needed to project strength and stamina, and on the whole, the consensus was that he succeeded.

“What heart attack?! @BernieSanders is giving a strong performance and not missing a step.” — Patti Solis Doyle, senior adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign “Bernie Sanders making a damn important point here — stuff in our county was bad before Trump was elected, and this election has to be about more than defeating Trump.” — Sally Kohn, progressive commentator and former campaign strategist “This was @BernieSanders’ best debate by far, but I still don’t hear him making a pitch to people who don’t already support him.” — Laura Belin, Iowa political commentator

Biden had an uneven performance

Mr. Biden won praise for his responses on foreign policy — frequently a strong area for him — but was criticized for seeming to claim credit for Ms. Warren’s work establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

“Biden needs to have a clear and compelling response to the Trump charge against him and his son, and I assumed he would have prepared one, but his answer is not sharp. When asked ‘did you make a mistake?’ he snaps back with a much sharper line.” — Robert Reich, professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and former labor secretary No one more experienced on foreign policy on this debate stage than @JoeBiden. This is where his experience shines and reminds voters that experience does matter.” — Adrienne Elrod, former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton “Biden yelling ‘I GOT you votes’ at Warren is not the best look.” — Kelly Dittmar, scholar at Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics

Other standout moments

Several other candidates got good reviews for specific answers: Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker on reproductive rights, and the former housing secretary Julián Castro for the statement, “Police violence is also gun violence.”

“Such a smart move by @KamalaHarris to refocus the conversation on women’s reproductive rights. She listened to women since the last debate and will gain attention and praise for it.” — Kelly Dittmar “@CoryBooker brings a lot to this primary, but perhaps his greatest debate contribution is his continuance to be the moral compass, reminding candidates and the audience what this campaign is really all about: defeating Trump and helping people live better lives.” — Adrienne Elrod “Castro was really strong on police violence there and brought in an angle on seizing guns that other candidates missed.” — Seth Masket, political scientist at the University of Denver

127,Frank Bruni,"Maybe thats smart politics. But its not great leadership.

It Was the Worst of Warren.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/opinion/democratic-debate-ohio.html,"She was referring to Tom Steyer, who was making his Democratic-debate debut.

Warren said that she had nothing against billionaires per se and wasn’t in the demonization business. She was in the justice business. And with her final remarks, she sought to underscore that with praise for a prominent Republican ally of the first President Bush. She also noted that two of her three brothers were Republicans and that she loved them very much.

The third reason I appreciated this debate is because it so perfectly underscored the most prominent candidates’ rationales for running and arguments for themselves. Apart from that odd exchange with Warren, Biden had a decent night, partly because he was given, and took advantage of, several opportunities to stress that he was more prepared for the presidency than anyone else and that the post-Trump era called for someone who wouldn’t have a steep learning curve. The repair work must begin immediately.

Buttigieg made clear that what he offers, at the tender age of 37, is a truly fresh perspective. He had a superb night, because he embraced a role as Warren’s inquisitor and because several supremely eloquent remarks about foreign policy — in particular, about Trump’s withdrawal of American troops from Syria — allowed him to project a command and maturity that some voters needed to see to consider him seriously.

Cory Booker quintupled down on his pitch as the candidate of love — and was so expansively loving to several of the other Democrats, including Kamala Harris and Biden, that I found myself wondering if this debate was a bid to salvage a flagging campaign or the beginning of an audition to be the eventual nominee’s running mate. As for Harris, she had strong moments, but they were neither strong nor frequent enough to alter her fortunes.

This was the most crowded televised presidential debate ever, with 12 candidates, so I’d need the column equivalent of “War and Peace” to appraise all of them. Still I’d feel remiss if I didn’t note that Sanders, who recently suffered a heart attack, seemed no less vigorous than he had before.

But Warren, not Sanders, was carrying the progressive mantle on Tuesday night, when her less liberal competitors sought with a new assertiveness to trip her up. I don’t think that they quite succeeded.

Warren exits this latest debate as strong as she entered it. And those of us who watched it understand her — the calculations behind her positioning, the potential miscalculations of her monumentally expensive plans and the profound conviction she summons — better than ever before. That’s no small payoff for three long hours.

Seven in 10 Democratic voters support mandatory buybacks, according to an August Quinnipiac poll, although less than half of all voters do.

There is a similar lack of consensus among the Democratic candidates on whether to force all gun owners to register their weapons in a national database. Democratic politicians long dismissed the idea of a gun registry as a fear-mongering tactic from the National Rifle Association, but it now enjoys broad support from the public: 62 percent of Americans back the idea, including 85 percent of Democrats.

Most candidates now favor establishing a registry, though some — including Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. — do not. Others, like Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, say it should apply only to owners of assault weapons.

Climate Change









Democratic voters widely believe that climate change represents an international emergency — 84 percent said so in the August Quinnipiac poll — and roughly nine in 10 think the United States is not doing enough to address global warming.

All the major Democratic candidates have expressed support for the Green New Deal, though some have been more guarded than others. All five senators who will debate Tuesday night co-sponsored the bill. Mr. Buttigieg has simply called it “the right beginning,” while Mr. Biden’s campaign website endorses it as a “crucial framework.”

But the Green New Deal enjoys broad support from the American public, with 63 percent of respondents to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll in July saying they like the idea of investing government money to fund sustainable infrastructure projects and green jobs. Among Democrats, it’s a particularly winning concept; 86 percent of Democrats nationwide back the Green New Deal, the poll found."

lisa tobin

Why aren’t we talking to Maggie and Alex?

monika evstatieva

— so to speak —

michael barbaro

I’m confused.

monika evstatieva

Still hold it to your —

alexander burns

Hello?

alexandra leigh young

Are you guys there? Monica?

alexander burns

You’ve got Alex Burns.

monika evstatieva

Please say yes.

alexandra leigh young

Oh, Alex Burns!

alexander burns

Hi.

michael barbaro

Alex Burns. Hello.

alexander burns

Hello?

michael barbaro

Hey.

alexander burns

Hi.

michael barbaro

Alex, can you hear me?

maggie haberman

Hello?

michael barbaro

Maggie!

maggie haberman

Michael.

michael barbaro

Good morning.

maggie haberman

Right. Yes, it is.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] Yes, it is.

maggie haberman

Good morning.

michael barbaro

So believe it or not, with you being in Ohio, me in Washington, and this team of editors and producers in New York, this is not exactly a flawless technical operation at 12:35 a.m.

alexander burns

I have faith in your crack team.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] I have faith too. It’s really the technology I’m beginning to question.

alexander burns

Hmm.

michael barbaro

Hmm. O.K., let’s do this. Alex, if you were going to summarize tonight in a sentence, what would it be?

alexander burns

I think this was the night where you really saw the moderate candidates on stage find their thirst for combat. And I think, interestingly, you saw that displayed not by folks like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar going after Joe Biden, the leading moderate candidate at this point in the race, but you saw it happen by them going after Elizabeth Warren to try to sort of prove their centrist credentials by challenging the left.

michael barbaro

Right. The front-runner who’s not actually quite the front-runner. I checked the polls right before the debate and by all accounts, statistically speaking, that is Joe Biden.

alexander burns

In an average of national polls, Joe Biden has a slight lead over Elizabeth Warren still in this race. But every other candidate in the race can read those trend lines just like we can. She is moving steadily up. He is moving steadily down. And the picture is even more pronounced in the early voting states, like Iowa and New Hampshire. So if you are a Pete Buttigieg or an Amy Klobuchar and you have staked your candidacy on a breakthrough in the Midwest, it is a bigger issue for you to get past Joe Biden and present yourself as a clear, compelling alternative to Elizabeth Warren than it is to go at Joe Biden directly.

michael barbaro

O.K., so let’s talk about how that actually played out.

archived recording (anderson cooper) This is the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate.

maggie haberman

So all 12 candidates are on stage. The debate begins.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support.

maggie haberman

The first question inevitably is about impeachment. This is the first debate since the impeachment inquiry began.

archived recording (anderson cooper) But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.

maggie haberman

And you had all 12 candidates in agreement —

archived recording (bernie sanders) I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment.

maggie haberman

— that they believe that Donald Trump should be impeached.

archived recording (joe biden) They would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.

maggie haberman

This is a big change from where things were within this Democratic field even a month ago.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment.

maggie haberman

And everybody was in unison. They didn’t all necessarily agree that he should be removed from office, but they did agree that he should be impeached.

archived recording (kamala harris) Our framers imagined this moment — a moment where we would have a corrupt president.

michael barbaro

Right. It seemed like every candidate used some version of the phrase “Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country.” It was almost verbatim.

archived recording (joe biden) This president is the most corrupt president in modern history — archived recording (bernie sanders) In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president — archived recording (tom steyer) — most corrupt president in the country. And that only the voice —

maggie haberman

And look, these candidates have generally tried to avoid having these debates be specifically just about Donald Trump. This was among the most Donald Trump-heavy first 10 minutes of a debate that I can recall.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the —

maggie haberman

But instead of using that moment as a way for any of them to sort of use a back door to criticize Joe Biden over the issue related to his son and the work his son had done in Ukraine while Biden was vice president, they all very pointedly, clearly, did not want to join President Trump’s attacks on Joe Biden.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

maggie haberman

None of them brought it up on their own as the debate went on. The rest of the night was really absent any issue related to Biden except for a question from the moderators.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. If it’s not O.K. for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it O.K. for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden? archived recording (joe biden) Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government.

michael barbaro

And everyone seemed quite ready to avoid it and just move on.

alexander burns

Right. And I think that that reflects a couple of things, right?

archived recording (anderson cooper) Senator Sanders, your response? archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me make a point. I think —

alexander burns

The moderators sort of teed up Bernie Sanders, if he wanted to go after Biden on the Hunter Ukraine issue.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured.

alexander burns

Bernie just totally did not take the bait, and neither did anybody else. And part of that is I think a sense among other Democrats that going at the Hunter issue, you really, really risk sort of triggering sympathy for Biden and looking like you are taking Trump’s side in a fight. And I think maybe as big or a bigger part of it is this calculation by a lot of the candidates on stage who want Joe Biden’s supporters to move over to their camp. That the way to do that is not by attacking Joe Biden and that you kind of got to trust that Biden is going to continue sinking in this race just by the force of gravity and his own limitations as a candidate and present yourself as a compelling alternative for people who are looking for a more moderate or a more conventional set of qualifications. And they do that by going after Elizabeth Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — after that. archived recording (marc lacey) Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for “Medicare for all.” You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?

maggie haberman

And you saw that right away with a question about Medicare for all, which she has been facing repeated questions about and people trying to pin her down.

michael barbaro

Right. There’s first an effort by our colleague, Marc Lacey, to twice pin her down on whether or not her Medicare for all plan would require a tax increase for middle-class voters. She doesn’t really answer the yes or no question.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not —

michael barbaro

Then Pete Buttigieg tries to get her to answer it and on and on. And she’s just kind of resolutely unwilling to say yes or no.

alexander burns

And it’s not even really sort of an ideological attack on her, right? You saw Pete Buttigieg pushing her just to sort of be straight on this question.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out —

alexander burns

It’s almost sort of a character attack as much as anything else. She loves talking about the mechanics of policy and where revenue will come from and where it will go and how regulations work and how it will change the way companies are structured. And the fact that this is the one place where she won’t say what we heard Bernie Sanders say —

archived recording (bernie sanders) Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up.

alexander burns

It would be a super sort of Warren-y answer, except she just doesn’t want to give it.

michael barbaro

And why exactly won’t she answer it, Maggie?

maggie haberman

Well, she won’t answer it because there’s not a great answer to the question. Usually when there is not a great answer to the question, you’ll see a politician do what she is doing, which is evade steadfastly.

archived recording (marc lacey) Senator — Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up? archived recording (elizabeth warren) So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind —

maggie haberman

The answer is most likely to be that there will be a tax hike, and that’s not an answer that she wants to be holding herself to right now. I also think that she’s probably leaving herself a little bit of room — emphasis on a little — for a general election on how she might answer this question of a pay-for for this plan. Her opponent, potentially, Donald Trump, is thrilled seeing her talk about this, because Trump and his advisers believe this is going to be an area where they can really push her and try to shove her closer toward the socialist label that he’s been trying to affix to most Democrats.

michael barbaro

And Alex, what did you think was the most notable exchange inside of this first round of efforts by the moderate Democrats on this stage to come after Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

Look, I thought it was the combination of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both speaking about Warren in terms of honesty.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is —

alexander burns

You heard Klobuchar, who has been so careful so far in this race to be very collegial with her Senate colleagues.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that. And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.

alexander burns

You heard her essentially describe Warren’s plans as a pipe dream.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done, and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers —

alexander burns

This is really harsh stuff, right? This is the kind of criticism that you have heard at other points in the race directed at Joe Biden.

maggie haberman

One thing, too, that I was struck by in Klobuchar’s answer is she more than once said that essentially, to Warren, your way of doing things is not the only way.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t —

michael barbaro

And does that reflect some kind of larger sentiment among these moderate candidates about Warren and about the way that she campaigns?

alexander burns

I think it reflects a resentment among some of the more moderate candidates of the way Warren argues sometimes explicitly, sometimes a little bit more subtly, that if you don’t approach policy the same way she does, it’s because you don’t have political guts. You don’t have grit. You’re not willing to fight —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we’ve — archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — got to stop —

alexander burns

For somebody like Amy Klobuchar, she sees how you get stuff done in government differently. She doesn’t think it makes her a coward. She thinks it sort of just reflects a different set of political values.

michael barbaro

So what’s the next notable exchange?

archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Congressman. archived recording (erin burnett) Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate.

alexander burns

You have this even messier multi-candidate pile-on around Warren’s proposal for a tax on huge private fortunes.

archived recording (erin burnett) Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.

alexander burns

That it sort of begins with this exchange involving Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, the only billionaire on stage, where —

archived recording (erin burnett) What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

alexander burns

— I think there’s an attempt by the moderators to try to draw out Steyer in a way that would maybe stir some tension on stage. And he basically says, look —

archived recording (tom steyer) Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor.

alexander burns

— wealth concentration is a problem. Then the spotlight moves back to some of those moderates we talked about before.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) This is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — to who sounded better on a debate stage — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. archived recording (pete buttigieg) — debate stage or in a committee hearing — archived recording (erin burnett) Senator Klobuchar — Senator Klobuchar — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — versus what it’s actually going to take to get something done. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I want to give a reality che — archived recording (erin burnett) Will a wealth tax work? archived recording (amy klobuchar) It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

alexander burns

You hear Amy Klobuchar not attacking the idea of a wealth tax — she says that she’s open to the idea — but again criticizing Warren for this sense that Warren thinks her ideas are the only good ideas.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that, after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.

alexander burns

Nobody is actually challenging the substance of her policy idea here. And in fact, you hear people across the ideological spectrum in the party either endorsing a wealth tax or at least indicating their openness to a wealth tax.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

alexander burns

So to me, this part is more of a primal scream of frustration towards Elizabeth Warren than a really concerted policy challenge.

michael barbaro

And when you say primal scream of frustration, I’m guessing you don’t just mean the fact that they think she talks about her ideas as if they are the best and the only good ideas, but perhaps because she’s just doing really well?

alexander burns

She is doing really well, right? That if you look back to where this race was when Beto O’Rourke got into it, right, back in the late winter or early spring, he was one of the leading candidates. Elizabeth Warren was at the back of the polls and struggling to sort of find two dimes to rub together for her campaign, right? Now she is one of the biggest fundraisers in the field. He is at the back of the pack, struggling to survive. And you do see — you saw it earlier in the race with Joe Biden. You see it now with Elizabeth Warren. People who are polling towards the back of the pack, trying to have some kind of impact in this race, go after the front-runner.

archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Senator Booker. archived recording (anderson cooper) We’ve got to take a quick break. We’ve got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio. We’ll be right back after this. [APPLAUSE]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording (anderson cooper) And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered —

michael barbaro

So as this debate went on, it felt like we saw the first substantive conversation on foreign policy that I can remember from these Democratic debates, in part, I think, because of the urgency of the situation that’s playing out in Syria. I wonder if it felt that way to both of you.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Vice President Biden, we —

maggie haberman

It didn’t feel that substantive to me, candidly. It felt urgent, and it felt emotional.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership.

maggie haberman

What I think was striking about it is that Joe Biden, who was vice president, seemed to really struggle in his answer to this question about what he would do and what he thought was necessary.

archived recording (joe biden) What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where — he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real locked-down conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now. Pay that price.

maggie haberman

I think that Biden still sounded as if he wasn’t quite sure what to do. And I really thought going into this debate that this was going to be an issue that Biden was going to score lots of points on, because it’s right in his wheelhouse.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s one of the ways that Biden has tried to distinguish himself, by pointing to his experience and his gravitas, especially around matters like foreign policy and military conflict.

archived recording (joe biden) I think I may be — doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan.

alexander burns

Right. You heard him make that argument quite explicitly, that he’s the one person on stage who needs no on-the-job training, that he has dealt with Putin, he has dealt with Erdogan directly. What he struggles with, as Maggie was saying, is communicating that in a way that conveys a sense of command and reassurance to the people who are watching the debate. I did think there were at least the germs of a bigger ideological argument about foreign policy.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this —

alexander burns

You did hear a pretty stark difference between Biden, on the one hand, who, not in a terribly articulate way, talked about keeping American troops in Syria in some fashion, and Elizabeth Warren saying quite directly that she wants to get rid of those troops, just not in the way Donald Trump has gone about doing it.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to get — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no — archived recording (anderson cooper) Yeah. Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — military solution — archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor Buttigieg? archived recording (elizabeth warren) — in this region.

michael barbaro

And Alex, does that ideological breakdown, when it comes to how the United States should use military forces, does that fall along familiar domestic debate ideological fault lines? Or is it different?

alexander burns

It doesn’t map precisely onto the same fault lines as domestic policy, economic policy, health care. But I do think that the more populist wing of the party represented by Warren and Sanders and a couple other people intermittently onstage is much more skeptical of the idea of the United States being involved in foreign wars, of having permanent troop presence overseas. And it is something, Michael, as you obviously recall, that the president played to quite effectively in 2016, is this idea that there actua — there may be a consensus in Washington for the United States to play this kind of role in foreign countries, but in the rest of America, there’s a lot of exhaustion and a lot of skepticism. And that’s part of what I think was so challenging for Biden in this moment, right? That just talking about restoring the bipartisan foreign policy consensus isn’t necessarily super compelling to base primary voters, at least the ones who are voting on foreign policy.

archived recording (anderson cooper) As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.

michael barbaro

So toward the end of the debate, the moderators asked this question that sort of seems to be pointed directly at this central tension that’s been playing out on stage.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump? archived recording (joe biden) Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people.

michael barbaro

I wonder what you make of the answers to that question.

alexander burns

Well, first, I think it’s really striking that the question needed to be asked in this specific way in order to draw Biden into conflict with Warren and Sanders. In past debates, he’s been so eager to go after them on a whole range of policies. In this debate, there were big sections of the night where he seemed to really fade from the foreground of this thing. And the moderators really sort of summon him to rise to this moment as a champion of the center in this race.

archived recording (joe biden) I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done.

alexander burns

He does it by describing himself as the only person on the stage who’s ever gotten big things done. He talks about the Violence Against Women Act. He talks about the Affordable Care Act. And he runs pretty quickly into quite a challenging confrontation with both Bernie Sanders and Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington —

maggie haberman

What ended up happening was Warren starts talking about her accomplishments. She talks about what she did after the 2008 fiscal crisis. She talks about her time at the C.F.P.B. She talks about what she wants to do.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) If we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — for the things that touch people’s lives. archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor — archived recording (joe biden) I agree —

maggie haberman

But you had Biden try to come back at Warren as she’s talking about what she did. He says, “I got you votes.”

archived recording (joe biden) I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight too.

maggie haberman

She sort of lets him finish. And there’s a pause, and you can see her almost drawing breath.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. And I am deeply —

maggie haberman

It’s a real dagger, because it’s a reminder that so much of what Joe Biden has done in this race has been talking about Obama’s record. Biden doesn’t handle that well —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) But understand — archived recording (joe biden) You did a hell of a job at your job. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Thank you. But understand this —

maggie haberman

— gets unhappy about it and pushes back that you did well in the role that you were in, meaning at the C.F.P.B. And there was just silence in the debate hall when he did it. It underscored what I think has been a theme for Biden in this race and certainly throughout the night when he was present onstage, which is it had this aura of don’t you understand that this is my turn, this is what I’m due? And it reminded me so much of what we would see with Hillary Clinton in 2016.

alexander burns

I think it was also just a total mismanagement by Biden of the dynamics of interacting with an emerging female front-runner in this race. That there was really no need, if you look at the record that he is standing on, for him to then try to sort of take a piece of her signature achievement, the creation of this new regulatory agency. And I think it was a reflection of her sort of lack of interest in escalating a fight with him, her sort of view that it didn’t make sense for her to sort of get into an extended fight with Joe Biden, that she didn’t come back at him harder on that front. It was a real role reversal from what we’ve seen in the race previously, where Joe Biden sort of goes from being the hunted to being the hunter as he sort of loses some traction at the top of this race.

archived recording (joe biden) And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who’s going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how are you going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade. archived recording (anderson cooper) Just to clarify —

michael barbaro

Alex, given the sensitive moment that Joe Biden is in right now with the president’s attacks on him and his son, is there an argument to be made that the best thing that could happen to Biden during this debate was kind of exactly what did happen? That he got to kind of hide away a little bit while all the moderates went after somebody else, Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

I think you can make the case that the best-case scenario for Biden at this point is to sort of protect the base that he has right now, hold steady, and trust the rest of the field to stay fractured. And if that’s the best case for him, then maybe that’s what he did tonight. I think it’s a really, really risky strategy, because it counts on everybody else being ineffective at appealing to the voters who are currently supporting you. So I think you could look at this as a low-risk debate for Biden, where he probably didn’t do damage to himself actively. I think you could also see it as a real missed opportunity for a guy who does have unmatched foreign policy credentials on that stage, who has been victimized by the president in a way that has launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump —

michael barbaro

Right.

alexander burns

— and who didn’t sort of wrap all that together and create a bigger moment for his campaign.

maggie haberman

I totally agree.

michael barbaro

Maggie, Alex, thank you. Good night, slash, good morning. We’ll talk soon.

[music]

alexander burns

Thanks, Michael.

maggie haberman

Thanks, Michael.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

michael barbaro Are you on deadline? michael schmidt No. michael barbaro Well, I’m looking for someone to tell me what else I need to know today. michael schmidt Um —

michael schmidt

On Tuesday, George Kent, a senior State Department adviser on Ukraine, went up to Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment proceedings. In Kent’s testimony, he says that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told him not to worry about Ukraine policy. Obviously, a little weird for a State Department official who specializes in Ukraine policy.

michael barbaro

The message being, like, we’ve got Ukraine over here at the White House. You at the State Department, that’s not your issue anymore.

Yet another odd way that the administration was handling its policy towards Ukraine. In the middle of this testimony, Giuliani himself puts out a letter that says that he is not going to comply with a subpoena from the House. The impeachment investigators want to talk to him. Giuliani says, nope, not coming. This is a sham, and he’s not going to participate.

He ha… [+981 chars]","Our reporters are following all of the exchanges and fact-checking the candidates, providing context and explanation on the policy debates.",2019-10-16,The New York Times,Fact-Checking the Democratic Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/us/politics/fact-check-october-debate.html,"What the facts are

Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator, said that while his “Medicare for all” health care plan would require tax increases on middle-class families, their overall spending would go down.

What Mr. Sanders said:

“I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up significantly for the wealthy and for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.”

This lacks evidence. Mr. Sanders’s health care plan would substantially increase the amount that the federal government spends. Estimates of its precise cost vary, but according to an estimate from the conservative Mercatus Center, which Mr. Sanders has mentioned approvingly, federal spending would need to increase by about 10 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, triple what the government spends on the military. But under Medicare for all, Americans who currently pay health insurance premiums or pay directly when they go to the doctor or pharmacy would be relieved of those costs. For most American families, that would be a substantial savings.

But that does not mean that “virtually everybody” would end up paying less over all. Mr. Sanders has suggested various possible tax increases that could pay for this expansion, including a payroll tax that would affect workers across the economic spectrum. He has not provided enough details about the mix and magnitude of taxes for economists to measure what sorts of families would be better or worse off under Medicare for all. An Urban Institute analysis of Mr. Sanders’s 2016 health care proposal, which included more tax details, found that the proposed taxes would only pay for about half of the cost of the plan.

What they’re talking about

Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, repeatedly avoided answering a question about whether financing her health care plan would require middle-class tax increases, saying instead that their “costs” would not go up.

What Ms. Warren said:

“I have made clear what my principles are here. And that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down.”

Ms. Warren has indeed proposed a number of large tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, including a new wealth tax, a corporate profits tax and an expansion of Social Security taxes up the income spectrum. But she has also earmarked close to all of the revenue raised by those taxes to pay for other domestic spending priorities, including free public college tuition and child care subsidies.

A Medicare for all health care program, like the one from Mr. Sanders that Ms. Warren has co-sponsored, would require substantial additional government spending. Ms. Warren would not say who would pay tax increases necessary to fund it. But it may be hard to squeeze that much more money out of the rich and corporations alone, beyond the new taxes she has already suggested. Her language about “costs” does provide the possibility that she would raise middle-class taxes, but ensure that middle-class families would save enough on health care spending to come out ahead."

At the same time, others like Ms. Gabbard, have been careful to endorse only the impeachment inquiry and not necessarily impeachment itself.

Below is a partial transcript of the exchange on impeachment at Tuesday night’s Democratic debate:

WARREN: Sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics. I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry. When I made the decision to run for president, I certainly didn’t think it was going to be about impeachment. But when the Mueller report came out, I read it, all 442 pages. And when I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown ... that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly. And so at that moment, I called for opening an impeachment inquiry. Now, that didn’t happen and look what happened as a result. Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke it again this fall.

You know, we took a constitutional oath, and that is that no one is above the law, and that includes the President of the United States. Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences. This is about Donald Trump. But understand, it’s about the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country. The impeachment must go forward.

ANDERSON COOPER: Thank you, Senator Warren. You’re all going to get in on this, by the way. Senator Sanders, do Democrats have any choice but to impeach? Please respond."

Mr. Biden’s treasury now ranks fifth in the Democratic field, also behind Senator Kamala Harris of California, who had $10.5 million in the bank, though her $911,000 in unpaid bills — to her pollster, media buyer and lawyers, among others — meant that her functional cash on hand was closer to $9.6 million. (Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg reported no debts.)

The self-funding billionaire Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July and reported spending $47 million , also has more financial resources than Mr. Biden heading toward the Iowa caucuses, which are less than four months away.

Mr. Biden’s team has steadfastly said that it has enough cash to run the campaign it wants, and recently announced plans to spend $6 million on digital and television ads in the coming months.

“The fundamental question about fund-raising is: Do you have what you need to run your race? And we do,” said Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden.

On Friday, Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, Greg Schultz, scheduled a conference call with the campaign’s donors, presumably to reassure them about the path forward.

Mr. Yang’s tielessness, after all, is a widely understood signifier of his tech success status; Mr. Steyer’s penchant for tartan is — well, what in the world is it?

Ties in general are increasingly seen as relics of the former establishment, but in the theater of politics, they are a nod to the formality of the office and indicator of respect for the past.

When male candidates want to prove their hard working bona fides and everyday-guy-ness, they tend to lose their ties and roll up their sleeves (except for Mr. Buttigieg, who loses his jacket). When they want to appear presidential, which in a debate context is what all their costume designers — sorry, “strategic consultants” — are aiming for, the default is almost always red or blue. Those colors have all the implicit references to flag-waving patriotism, especially when placed against a white shirt, and party loyalty. When they want to push some boundaries, sometimes stripes come into play, or very occasionally, purple (a red and blue combination that suggests compromise). Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington , in his brief candidacy, favored green because, you know: climate.

Tartan, with all its connotations of Christmas, school uniforms and marching across the moor to bagpipes, may speak to a certain tradition, but it’s not a stereotypical American one, which makes it uncomfortably close to the novelty tie for many viewers."

Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage. What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

STEYER: First of all, let me say this. Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor. And the results are as shameful as Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income. It’s absolutely wrong. It’s absolutely undemocratic and unfair. I was one of the first people on this stage to propose a wealth tax. I would undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations. But there’s something else going on here that is absolutely shameful, and that’s the way the money gets split up in terms of earnings. As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor, people haven’t had a raise — 90 percent of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years.

If you took the minimum wage from 1980 and just adjusted it for inflation, you get 11 bucks. It’s seven and a quarter. If you included productivity gains of American workers, it would be over 20 bucks. There’s something wrong here. And that is that the corporations have bought our government. Our government has failed. That’s why I’m running for president. Because we’re not going to get any of the policies that everybody on this stage wants — health care, education, Green New Deal or a living wage — unless we break the power of these corporations.

BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Vice President Biden, you have warned against demonizing rich people. Do you believe that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren’s wealth tax plans do that?

BIDEN: No, look. Demonizing wealth — what I talked about is how you get things done. And the way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now. The idea — we have to start rewarding work, not just wealth. I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate of 39.5 percent. I would double it. Because guess what? Why in God’s name should someone who is clipping coupons in the stock market pay a lower tax rate than someone who in fact is, like I said — a schoolteacher and a firefighter? It’s ridiculous, and they pay a lower tax. Secondly, the idea that we, in fact, engage in this notion that there are — there’s $1.64 trillion in tax loopholes. You can’t justify at minimum $600 billion of that. We could eliminate it all. I could go into detail had I the time. Secondly — thirdly — what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the American people that we are going to raise taxes on the wealthy. We are going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not. This is one of the reasons why these debates are kind of crazy. Because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given. The fact is, everybody is right about the fact that the fourth industrial revolution is costing jobs. It is. The fact is also corporate greed, if they’re going back and not investing in their employees, they’re reinvesting in buying back their stock."

Tonight, 12 Democratic candidates will be debating near Columbus, Ohio. Here’s what I’ll be looking for from the seven candidates with the best chances of winning the nomination:

Elizabeth Warren. Swing voters exist, and they are likely to decide the 2020 election, much as they played a decisive role in 2016 and 2018. So far, Warren has not worried much about appealing to them. Now that she’s the front-runner, can she begin to signal to Democrats that she wants to be ruthless about beating President Trump?

Joe Biden. He has yet to seem sharp for an entire debate. Can he break that streak and alleviate concerns about his ability to withstand a long, vicious campaign? I’m more interested in that than the narrow questions of how he responds to Trump’s false smears against his family.

Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. They are the best-positioned candidates to benefit from Biden’s uneven campaign and win over more moderate Democrats. Can any of the three make an explicit case: I’m stronger than Biden and more electable than Warren?"

Re “Race Takes Turn as Warren Faces Barrage Onstage” (front page, Oct. 16):

After watching all the Democratic debates, I am left with the following sentiments that I believe are shared by many Democrats:

My heart is with Bernie Sanders because what he says about America and what needs to be done is absolutely true. My head is with Elizabeth Warren because she is Bernie lite, a progressive who is more electable than Bernie since she is less scary to suburban Republicans and independents. And my fear puts me with Uncle Joe, because he may be most likely to beat President Trump in the swing Rust Belt states, and the thought of four more years of Trumpism is unspeakable.

But I felt the same way about Hillary Clinton and look how that turned out.

The others do nothing for this 65-year-old longtime Democrat. So how do I vote? I don’t know.

What struck me most about Tuesday night was how articulate all of the candidates were in expressing their positions compared with the muddled thoughts and language we’ve heard from President Trump ever since he appeared on the national stage.

Re “Why Some Young Voters Bolt the Democratic Party for Democratic Socialism” (news article, Oct. 16):

As a student at a very liberal college, SUNY New Paltz, I see more and more of my peers identifying with socialist beliefs, especially since Bernie Sanders’s run for president in 2016. Although I agree that people my age (in their 20s) are increasingly seeing the benefits of a socialist candidate and his policies, I see even more of my peers simply not caring at all.

In the 2016 presidential election, o nly a little more than half o f the students on my campus voted. A lot of my friends chose not to vote either because of a general lack of interest in politics or because they didn’t support either of the candidates.

It is also difficult for young people coming from disadvantaged backgrounds who have never felt represented to believe that socialism will ever work in our society.

Let’s do, to borrow a word from Andrew Yang’s lapel pin, the math. There were 12 candidates onstage Tuesday, any of whom could have had exchanges with one or more of the others. That made for (counts on fingers) a lot of different interpersonal dynamics. The debate was scheduled for three hours, yet — even with formal opening and closing statements dispensed with — it still ran long.

So there was room for a great number of debates within this debate, sponsored by CNN and The New York Times. This debate had many rooms. It had geologic ages. I believe that somewhere in there, they awarded the Oscar for Best Picture. It is said that near its beginning, the candidates argued about the merits of Medicare for All and how to pay for it, but those are only rumors; no written records remain from that time.

This ultramegasupersized format was the product of the decisions, first, to re-loosen the qualifications that had been tightened for the September debate, where only 10 made the stage, and second, to hold it all on one night, at “Lord of the Rings” length, with as many participants as there are signs of the zodiac.

Focusing only on taxes is pointless. But in a larger way, she’s wrong.

The No. 1 reason to question her version of Medicare for All — in which private health insurance would be eliminated — is its political viability. It would be an enormous disruption to the health care system, and history shows that health care disruptions are very hard to pass and usually unpopular at first. Polls show that her plan is already unpopular, and it would be a bigger disruption than Obamacare or Bill Clinton’s failed plan.

Given all that, she needs to engage with the political realities — with how she would overcome people’s resistance to giving up their health insurance for a larger new program that, yes, would require a tax increase.

I think Warren has run an excellent campaign on the whole, and I think she has the most thoughtful agenda for addressing the stagnating living standards of most Americans. I’m surprised that she has chosen to focus so much of her candidacy on the most aggressive version of Medicare for All. But she has. Now it’s time for her to tell voters how she will deal with the politics of passing it.

In my view, her best answer involves finding a way to signal her openness to a transition, in which people who want to keep their private insurance can do so (and taxes don’t yet need to rise) while Medicare initially expands voluntarily. That idea is hugely popular."

Some candidates have more maneuvering room than others to challenge the two leaders: Whereas Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders are flush with cash, Ms. Klobuchar is in a far more tenuous financial position and has yet to qualify for the debate in November. At least a few other candidates who took an assertive approach Tuesday are in similar straits, straining to raise money or meet the debate threshold or both.

What could prove decisive in Iowa, and beyond, is if centrist voters coalesce behind a single candidate or fracture among the group of hopefuls presenting themselves as pragmatists. If Mr. Biden cannot recover a measure of momentum, but holds on to enough support to block other candidates from building a coalition of more moderate Democrats, it could allow Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders to roll through the earliest primaries and caucuses with relatively weak opposition.

This scenario, of a sort of zombie Biden candidacy, is what most alarms supporters of other center-left Democrats in the race.

Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, a close ally of Mr. Buttigieg, predicted the South Bend mayor would now “dig down deep in Iowa and New Hampshire,” carrying his message from the debate — a combination of uplifting rhetoric about the future and blunt criticism of certain progressive policies — into the early states where he’s polling in fourth place.

Ms. Whaley said she expected Mr. Buttigieg, 37, to make a determined effort to displace Mr. Biden as the candidate seen as most capable of speaking to Midwesterners."

I know what the job is. I’ve been engaged. Look, one of the reasons I’m running is because of my age and my experience. With it comes wisdom. We need someone to take office this time around who on Day 1 can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders from Putin to our allies, and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track. It is required, now more than any time in any of our lifetimes, to have someone who has that capacity on Day 1. That’s one of the reasons why I decided to run, why I decided to run this time, because I know what has to be done. I’ve done it before. I’ve been there when we pulled the nation out of the worst financial recession in history. I’ve been there, and I’ve got so many pieces of legislation passed, including the Affordable Care Act as well as making sure that we had the Recovery Act, which kept us from going into a depression. I know what has to be done. I will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office. And I will release my medical records, as I have 21 years of my tax records, which no one else on this stage has done, so that you can have full transparency as to my health and what I am doing.

Forty percent of Democratic primary voters say they think a candidate under the age of 70 is more likely to defeat President Trump. What do you say to them?

WARREN: Well, I say I will outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with. Look, the way I see this, the way we’re going to win is by addressing head-on what millions of Americans know in their bones, and that is that the wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy, and they’re making it work for themselves and leaving everyone else behind. And political pundits and Washington insiders and, shoot, people in our own party don’t want to admit that. They think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy. They are wrong. If all Democrats can promise is after Donald Trump, it will be business as usual, then we will lose. Democrats win when we call out what’s broken and we show how to fix it. Democrats will win when we fight for the things that touch people’s lives, things like child care and health care and housing costs. Democrats will win when we give people a reason to get in the fight."

“It’s been the most shameful thing any president has done in modern history in terms of foreign policy,” former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said.

While Democrats have been consumed with the Trump administration’s dealings with Russia and Ukraine, the emerging foreign policy crisis in Syria presented a delicate test for the party’s presidential hopefuls on the debate stage.

In the first exchange, Ms. Warren, who is from Massachusetts, was asked repeatedly how she would pay for “Medicare for all” and insisted that costs would not increase for middle-class Americans. But she would not say outright that taxes would or would not increase.

Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who has championed a single-payer system, said taxes would go up for “virtually everybody.” But he added that the tax increase would be substantially less than what people currently pay for premiums and out-of-pocket health care expenses.

“At least Bernie is being honest here, and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,” Ms. Klobuchar, of Minnesota, said after his comments."

Biden Jr. escalated his criticism of his most formidable rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, suggesting that she was not being forthright about the costs of her far-reaching policy proposals and questioning her “credibility.”

Mr. Biden zeroed in on Ms. Warren’s refusal to say if she would raise taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for “Medicare for all,” a single-payer health care system that would all but eliminate private health insurance. While other candidates are pouncing on that issue as well, Mr. Biden is under particular pressure because Ms. Warren has passed him in some national and early-state polls and joined him as a front-runner, a status he held alone for months.

“It’s fascinating that the person who has a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential issue in this election in the minds of the American people across the board,” Mr. Biden said, addressing reporters on a cold, gray afternoon outside a union electrical trade center."

“It’s not lost on people that many of these candidates were actually on the record supporting impeachment before anyone was even talking about Ukraine,” said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and former Trump White House official.

The debate, held outside Columbus, Ohio, allowed Republicans to try to make their case in a state that Mr. Trump won by eight percentage points in 2016 and has many of the middle-class, blue-collar voters that he hopes to turn out again in next year’s election. To underscore the point, the Trump campaign took out a full-page ad in the Columbus Dispatch on Tuesday that blared, “Democrats Will Kill Ohio Jobs … President Trump’s Fighting for the Economy.”

The president remains historically unpopular, however. The Gallup presidential approval poll has measured public support for his job performance at below 50 percent for his entire presidency. To overcome this skepticism, Republicans have attempted to define the Democrats as out of touch and too far to the left of where most Americans’ views are. Some of the Democratic candidates, like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., hold moderate and liberal views, while Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont are generally more progressive.

Senator Marco Rubio of Florida on Wednesday expressed the kind of binary argument that Republicans hope prevails on voters. “Last night’s debate was a reminder that while you may not always agree with everything Trump says or does, the leading alternatives to Trump mock people with traditional beliefs & support socialism, gun confiscation & free government funded health care for unlawful immigrants,” he wrote on Twitter.

With Ms. Warren the target of sustained attacks from the other Democrats onstage, Mr. Trump and his Republican allies moved to frame the race around the question of whether voters want a strongly liberal president and government in 2021.

On Tuesday night, after Mr. Sanders picked up the support of two high-profile liberals in the House Democratic caucus — Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar — Republicans jumped at the chance to make them a focal point in the morning-after debate analysis.

She then dwelled on a description of how she would pull back differently, and more skillfully, than Mr. Trump’s rapid and chaotic retreat in the past week.

Mr. Biden, the only one of the candidates with a long record in foreign issues, declined — twice — to answer a question about whether he would reinsert the American troops that have been withdrawn from northern Syria. Instead, he talked about protecting the forces still in the country, saying he would give them air cover and “make it clear they’re not going anywhere.”

He then turned to Mr. Trump’s abandonment of the Kurds, America’s longtime ally in fighting ISIS, shouting: “This is shameful! Shameful what this man has done.”

Only Mayor Pete Buttigieg of Indiana, who served in Afghanistan, made the distinction between ending large combat operations and keeping “a small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities” on the ground, especially in Syria.

Those forces, he argued, “were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria” and “the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS.” It is a distinction Mr. Trump, and many of those seeking to run against him on the Democratic ticket, have passed by.

The exchanges on Syria, followed by a parallel discussion of how to contain Russia’s increasing aggressiveness, underscored one of the oddities of the 2020 election season: Faced with a Republican president who has envisioned a far more isolationist approach to American power, the Democrats are sounding like interventionist Republicans of just a few years ago.

When Mitt Romney ran against President Barack Obama in 2012, he called Russia the “No. 1 geopolitical foe” facing the United States and argued that containing Mr. Putin would be his top priority. That led Mr. Obama, with a laugh, to respond: “The 1980s, they’re now calling to ask for their foreign policy back,” an effort to paint Mr. Romney as a cold warrior who did not realize that era had passed."

Here is a sampling of their reactions.

Warren took fire from all sides

The strategists agreed on one thing: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s new front-runner status was clear, because she was everyone else’s biggest target. But they were divided on how well she handled the attacks.

“Warren took almost everyone’s best punch there & came away basically unscathed.” — Jesse Lehrich, former foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton “Heading into this debate as a frontrunner, she did not seem ready for the incoming.” — Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and former Democratic National Committee spokesman “This is the @ewarren debate. You might be happy or sad about it, but she’s the one who is setting the tone and she’s the reference point for most of the other candidates. That happens to the frontrunner.” — Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics

Buttigieg stood out …

Several consultants said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., had successfully set himself up as an alternative for moderate Democrats uneasy with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They particularly liked his responses on foreign policy, which he framed in terms of his own experience in the military.

“Very strong, passionate and compelling condemnation of @realDonaldTrump betrayal of Kurds from Northern Syria by @PeteButtigieg. Owning this discussion.” — David Axelrod, former chief strategist for Barack Obama “I am impressed with Buttigieg on foreign policy. Like Biden, he really shines and opens up when he talks about FP.” — Jess Morales Rocketto, political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance “This has been @PeteButtigieg’s best #DemDebate performance so far. While other candidates tried to out-left and anti-Trump each other, Mayor Pete came across as reasonable and rational.” — Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster

… and so did Klobuchar

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota received similarly positive reviews, with strategists arguing that she and Mr. Buttigieg in the middle against Ms. Warren on the left was the biggest dynamic of the night.

“@amyklobuchar performance tonight will resonate with moderate Democrats who are tired of being told that they are sellouts if they don’t subscribe to most left views. It’s a theme that’s cut across all her answers tonight & why she is having a good night.” — Jennifer Palmieri, former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama “With 11 other people on stage, you don’t get a lot of opportunities to make an impression.

Not sure that makes her electable, but it’s nice to hear.” — Joe Lockhart, former spokesman for President Bill Clinton

Sanders was reassuring

After his heart attack two weeks ago, Senator Bernie Sanders badly needed to project strength and stamina, and on the whole, the consensus was that he succeeded.

“What heart attack?! @BernieSanders is giving a strong performance and not missing a step.” — Patti Solis Doyle, senior adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign “Bernie Sanders making a damn important point here — stuff in our county was bad before Trump was elected, and this election has to be about more than defeating Trump.” — Sally Kohn, progressive commentator and former campaign strategist “This was @BernieSanders’ best debate by far, but I still don’t hear him making a pitch to people who don’t already support him.” — Laura Belin, Iowa political commentator

Biden had an uneven performance

Mr. Biden won praise for his responses on foreign policy — frequently a strong area for him — but was criticized for seeming to claim credit for Ms. Warren’s work establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

“Biden needs to have a clear and compelling response to the Trump charge against him and his son, and I assumed he would have prepared one, but his answer is not sharp. When asked ‘did you make a mistake?’ he snaps back with a much sharper line.” — Robert Reich, professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and former labor secretary No one more experienced on foreign policy on this debate stage than @JoeBiden. This is where his experience shines and reminds voters that experience does matter.” — Adrienne Elrod, former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton “Biden yelling ‘I GOT you votes’ at Warren is not the best look.” — Kelly Dittmar, scholar at Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics

Other standout moments

Several other candidates got good reviews for specific answers: Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker on reproductive rights, and the former housing secretary Julián Castro for the statement, “Police violence is also gun violence.”

“Such a smart move by @KamalaHarris to refocus the conversation on women’s reproductive rights. She listened to women since the last debate and will gain attention and praise for it.” — Kelly Dittmar “@CoryBooker brings a lot to this primary, but perhaps his greatest debate contribution is his continuance to be the moral compass, reminding candidates and the audience what this campaign is really all about: defeating Trump and helping people live better lives.” — Adrienne Elrod “Castro was really strong on police violence there and brought in an angle on seizing guns that other candidates missed.” — Seth Masket, political scientist at the University of Denver

The bottom line"
156,Frank Bruni,"Maybe thats smart politics. But its not great leadership.

One is that Warrens rivals jousted with her more than before on health care, on her wealth t… [+1538 chars]",Tuesday’s debate — the tensest yet — put the Democrats’ newly minted front-runner to the test.,2019-10-16,The New York Times,It Was the Best of Warren. It Was the Worst of Warren.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/opinion/democratic-debate-ohio.html,"She was referring to Tom Steyer, who was making his Democratic-debate debut.

Warren said that she had nothing against billionaires per se and wasn’t in the demonization business. She was in the justice business. And with her final remarks, she sought to underscore that with praise for a prominent Republican ally of the first President Bush. She also noted that two of her three brothers were Republicans and that she loved them very much.

The third reason I appreciated this debate is because it so perfectly underscored the most prominent candidates’ rationales for running and arguments for themselves. Apart from that odd exchange with Warren, Biden had a decent night, partly because he was given, and took advantage of, several opportunities to stress that he was more prepared for the presidency than anyone else and that the post-Trump era called for someone who wouldn’t have a steep learning curve. The repair work must begin immediately.

Buttigieg made clear that what he offers, at the tender age of 37, is a truly fresh perspective. He had a superb night, because he embraced a role as Warren’s inquisitor and because several supremely eloquent remarks about foreign policy — in particular, about Trump’s withdrawal of American troops from Syria — allowed him to project a command and maturity that some voters needed to see to consider him seriously.

Cory Booker quintupled down on his pitch as the candidate of love — and was so expansively loving to several of the other Democrats, including Kamala Harris and Biden, that I found myself wondering if this debate was a bid to salvage a flagging campaign or the beginning of an audition to be the eventual nominee’s running mate. As for Harris, she had strong moments, but they were neither strong nor frequent enough to alter her fortunes.

This was the most crowded televised presidential debate ever, with 12 candidates, so I’d need the column equivalent of “War and Peace” to appraise all of them. Still I’d feel remiss if I didn’t note that Sanders, who recently suffered a heart attack, seemed no less vigorous than he had before.

But Warren, not Sanders, was carrying the progressive mantle on Tuesday night, when her less liberal competitors sought with a new assertiveness to trip her up. I don’t think that they quite succeeded.

Warren exits this latest debate as strong as she entered it. And those of us who watched it understand her — the calculations behind her positioning, the potential miscalculations of her monumentally expensive plans and the profound conviction she summons — better than ever before. That’s no small payoff for three long hours.

Hello?

Hey.

Hi.

Alex, can you hear me?

Hello?

michael barbaro

Michael.

Good morning.

maggie haberman

Right. Yes, it is.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] Yes, it is.

maggie haberman

Good morning.

michael barbaro

So believe it or not, with you being in Ohio, me in Washington, and this team of editors and producers in New York, this is not exactly a flawless technical operation at 12:35 a.m.

alexander burns

I have faith in your crack team.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] I have faith too. It’s really the technology I’m beginning to question.

alexander burns

Hmm.

michael barbaro

Hmm. O.K., let’s do this. Alex, if you were going to summarize tonight in a sentence, what would it be?

alexander burns

I think this was the night where you really saw the moderate candidates on stage find their thirst for combat. And I think, interestingly, you saw that displayed not by folks like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar going after Joe Biden, the leading moderate candidate at this point in the race, but you saw it happen by them going after Elizabeth Warren to try to sort of prove their centrist credentials by challenging the left.

michael barbaro

Right. The front-runner who’s not actually quite the front-runner. I checked the polls right before the debate and by all accounts, statistically speaking, that is Joe Biden.

alexander burns

In an average of national polls, Joe Biden has a slight lead over Elizabeth Warren still in this race. But every other candidate in the race can read those trend lines just like we can. She is moving steadily up. He is moving steadily down. And the picture is even more pronounced in the early voting states, like Iowa and New Hampshire. So if you are a Pete Buttigieg or an Amy Klobuchar and you have staked your candidacy on a breakthrough in the Midwest, it is a bigger issue for you to get past Joe Biden and present yourself as a clear, compelling alternative to Elizabeth Warren than it is to go at Joe Biden directly.

michael barbaro

O.K., so let’s talk about how that actually played out.

archived recording (anderson cooper) This is the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate.

maggie haberman

So all 12 candidates are on stage. The debate begins.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support.

maggie haberman

The first question inevitably is about impeachment. This is the first debate since the impeachment inquiry began.

archived recording (anderson cooper) But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.

maggie haberman

And you had all 12 candidates in agreement —

archived recording (bernie sanders) I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment.

maggie haberman

— that they believe that Donald Trump should be impeached.

archived recording (joe biden) They would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.

maggie haberman

This is a big change from where things were within this Democratic field even a month ago.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment.

maggie haberman

And everybody was in unison. They didn’t all necessarily agree that he should be removed from office, but they did agree that he should be impeached.

archived recording (kamala harris) Our framers imagined this moment — a moment where we would have a corrupt president.

michael barbaro

Right. It seemed like every candidate used some version of the phrase “Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country.” It was almost verbatim.

archived recording (joe biden) This president is the most corrupt president in modern history — archived recording (bernie sanders) In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president — archived recording (tom steyer) — most corrupt president in the country. And that only the voice —

maggie haberman

And look, these candidates have generally tried to avoid having these debates be specifically just about Donald Trump. This was among the most Donald Trump-heavy first 10 minutes of a debate that I can recall.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the —

maggie haberman

But instead of using that moment as a way for any of them to sort of use a back door to criticize Joe Biden over the issue related to his son and the work his son had done in Ukraine while Biden was vice president, they all very pointedly, clearly, did not want to join President Trump’s attacks on Joe Biden.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

maggie haberman

None of them brought it up on their own as the debate went on. The rest of the night was really absent any issue related to Biden except for a question from the moderators.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. If it’s not O.K. for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it O.K. for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden? archived recording (joe biden) Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government.

michael barbaro

And everyone seemed quite ready to avoid it and just move on.

alexander burns

Right. And I think that that reflects a couple of things, right?

archived recording (anderson cooper) Senator Sanders, your response? archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me make a point. I think —

alexander burns

The moderators sort of teed up Bernie Sanders, if he wanted to go after Biden on the Hunter Ukraine issue.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured.

alexander burns

Bernie just totally did not take the bait, and neither did anybody else. And part of that is I think a sense among other Democrats that going at the Hunter issue, you really, really risk sort of triggering sympathy for Biden and looking like you are taking Trump’s side in a fight. And I think maybe as big or a bigger part of it is this calculation by a lot of the candidates on stage who want Joe Biden’s supporters to move over to their camp. That the way to do that is not by attacking Joe Biden and that you kind of got to trust that Biden is going to continue sinking in this race just by the force of gravity and his own limitations as a candidate and present yourself as a compelling alternative for people who are looking for a more moderate or a more conventional set of qualifications. And they do that by going after Elizabeth Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — after that. archived recording (marc lacey) Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for “Medicare for all.” You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?

maggie haberman

And you saw that right away with a question about Medicare for all, which she has been facing repeated questions about and people trying to pin her down.

michael barbaro

Right. There’s first an effort by our colleague, Marc Lacey, to twice pin her down on whether or not her Medicare for all plan would require a tax increase for middle-class voters. She doesn’t really answer the yes or no question.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not —

michael barbaro

Then Pete Buttigieg tries to get her to answer it and on and on. And she’s just kind of resolutely unwilling to say yes or no.

alexander burns

And it’s not even really sort of an ideological attack on her, right? You saw Pete Buttigieg pushing her just to sort of be straight on this question.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out —

alexander burns

It’s almost sort of a character attack as much as anything else. She loves talking about the mechanics of policy and where revenue will come from and where it will go and how regulations work and how it will change the way companies are structured. And the fact that this is the one place where she won’t say what we heard Bernie Sanders say —

archived recording (bernie sanders) Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up.

alexander burns

It would be a super sort of Warren-y answer, except she just doesn’t want to give it.

michael barbaro

And why exactly won’t she answer it, Maggie?

maggie haberman

Well, she won’t answer it because there’s not a great answer to the question. Usually when there is not a great answer to the question, you’ll see a politician do what she is doing, which is evade steadfastly.

archived recording (marc lacey) Senator — Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up? archived recording (elizabeth warren) So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind —

maggie haberman

The answer is most likely to be that there will be a tax hike, and that’s not an answer that she wants to be holding herself to right now. I also think that she’s probably leaving herself a little bit of room — emphasis on a little — for a general election on how she might answer this question of a pay-for for this plan. Her opponent, potentially, Donald Trump, is thrilled seeing her talk about this, because Trump and his advisers believe this is going to be an area where they can really push her and try to shove her closer toward the socialist label that he’s been trying to affix to most Democrats.

michael barbaro

And Alex, what did you think was the most notable exchange inside of this first round of efforts by the moderate Democrats on this stage to come after Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

Look, I thought it was the combination of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both speaking about Warren in terms of honesty.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is —

alexander burns

You heard Klobuchar, who has been so careful so far in this race to be very collegial with her Senate colleagues.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that. And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.

alexander burns

You heard her essentially describe Warren’s plans as a pipe dream.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done, and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers —

alexander burns

This is really harsh stuff, right? This is the kind of criticism that you have heard at other points in the race directed at Joe Biden.

maggie haberman

One thing, too, that I was struck by in Klobuchar’s answer is she more than once said that essentially, to Warren, your way of doing things is not the only way.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t —

michael barbaro

And does that reflect some kind of larger sentiment among these moderate candidates about Warren and about the way that she campaigns?

alexander burns

I think it reflects a resentment among some of the more moderate candidates of the way Warren argues sometimes explicitly, sometimes a little bit more subtly, that if you don’t approach policy the same way she does, it’s because you don’t have political guts. You don’t have grit. You’re not willing to fight —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we’ve — archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — got to stop —

alexander burns

For somebody like Amy Klobuchar, she sees how you get stuff done in government differently. She doesn’t think it makes her a coward. She thinks it sort of just reflects a different set of political values.

michael barbaro

So what’s the next notable exchange?

archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Congressman. archived recording (erin burnett) Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate.

alexander burns

You have this even messier multi-candidate pile-on around Warren’s proposal for a tax on huge private fortunes.

archived recording (erin burnett) Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.

alexander burns

That it sort of begins with this exchange involving Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, the only billionaire on stage, where —

archived recording (erin burnett) What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

alexander burns

— I think there’s an attempt by the moderators to try to draw out Steyer in a way that would maybe stir some tension on stage. And he basically says, look —

archived recording (tom steyer) Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor.

alexander burns

— wealth concentration is a problem. Then the spotlight moves back to some of those moderates we talked about before.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) This is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — to who sounded better on a debate stage — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. archived recording (pete buttigieg) — debate stage or in a committee hearing — archived recording (erin burnett) Senator Klobuchar — Senator Klobuchar — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — versus what it’s actually going to take to get something done. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I want to give a reality che — archived recording (erin burnett) Will a wealth tax work? archived recording (amy klobuchar) It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

alexander burns

You hear Amy Klobuchar not attacking the idea of a wealth tax — she says that she’s open to the idea — but again criticizing Warren for this sense that Warren thinks her ideas are the only good ideas.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that, after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.

alexander burns

Nobody is actually challenging the substance of her policy idea here. And in fact, you hear people across the ideological spectrum in the party either endorsing a wealth tax or at least indicating their openness to a wealth tax.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

alexander burns

So to me, this part is more of a primal scream of frustration towards Elizabeth Warren than a really concerted policy challenge.

michael barbaro

And when you say primal scream of frustration, I’m guessing you don’t just mean the fact that they think she talks about her ideas as if they are the best and the only good ideas, but perhaps because she’s just doing really well?

alexander burns

She is doing really well, right? That if you look back to where this race was when Beto O’Rourke got into it, right, back in the late winter or early spring, he was one of the leading candidates. Elizabeth Warren was at the back of the polls and struggling to sort of find two dimes to rub together for her campaign, right? Now she is one of the biggest fundraisers in the field. He is at the back of the pack, struggling to survive. And you do see — you saw it earlier in the race with Joe Biden. You see it now with Elizabeth Warren. People who are polling towards the back of the pack, trying to have some kind of impact in this race, go after the front-runner.

archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Senator Booker. archived recording (anderson cooper) We’ve got to take a quick break. We’ve got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio. We’ll be right back after this. [APPLAUSE]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording (anderson cooper) And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered —

michael barbaro

So as this debate went on, it felt like we saw the first substantive conversation on foreign policy that I can remember from these Democratic debates, in part, I think, because of the urgency of the situation that’s playing out in Syria. I wonder if it felt that way to both of you.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Vice President Biden, we —

maggie haberman

It didn’t feel that substantive to me, candidly. It felt urgent, and it felt emotional.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership.

maggie haberman

What I think was striking about it is that Joe Biden, who was vice president, seemed to really struggle in his answer to this question about what he would do and what he thought was necessary.

archived recording (joe biden) What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where — he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real locked-down conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now. Pay that price.

maggie haberman

I think that Biden still sounded as if he wasn’t quite sure what to do. And I really thought going into this debate that this was going to be an issue that Biden was going to score lots of points on, because it’s right in his wheelhouse.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s one of the ways that Biden has tried to distinguish himself, by pointing to his experience and his gravitas, especially around matters like foreign policy and military conflict.

archived recording (joe biden) I think I may be — doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan.

alexander burns

Right. You heard him make that argument quite explicitly, that he’s the one person on stage who needs no on-the-job training, that he has dealt with Putin, he has dealt with Erdogan directly. What he struggles with, as Maggie was saying, is communicating that in a way that conveys a sense of command and reassurance to the people who are watching the debate. I did think there were at least the germs of a bigger ideological argument about foreign policy.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this —

alexander burns

You did hear a pretty stark difference between Biden, on the one hand, who, not in a terribly articulate way, talked about keeping American troops in Syria in some fashion, and Elizabeth Warren saying quite directly that she wants to get rid of those troops, just not in the way Donald Trump has gone about doing it.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to get — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no — archived recording (anderson cooper) Yeah. Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — military solution — archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor Buttigieg? archived recording (elizabeth warren) — in this region.

michael barbaro

And Alex, does that ideological breakdown, when it comes to how the United States should use military forces, does that fall along familiar domestic debate ideological fault lines? Or is it different?

alexander burns

It doesn’t map precisely onto the same fault lines as domestic policy, economic policy, health care. But I do think that the more populist wing of the party represented by Warren and Sanders and a couple other people intermittently onstage is much more skeptical of the idea of the United States being involved in foreign wars, of having permanent troop presence overseas. And it is something, Michael, as you obviously recall, that the president played to quite effectively in 2016, is this idea that there actua — there may be a consensus in Washington for the United States to play this kind of role in foreign countries, but in the rest of America, there’s a lot of exhaustion and a lot of skepticism. And that’s part of what I think was so challenging for Biden in this moment, right? That just talking about restoring the bipartisan foreign policy consensus isn’t necessarily super compelling to base primary voters, at least the ones who are voting on foreign policy.

archived recording (anderson cooper) As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.

michael barbaro

So toward the end of the debate, the moderators asked this question that sort of seems to be pointed directly at this central tension that’s been playing out on stage.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump? archived recording (joe biden) Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people.

michael barbaro

I wonder what you make of the answers to that question.

alexander burns

Well, first, I think it’s really striking that the question needed to be asked in this specific way in order to draw Biden into conflict with Warren and Sanders. In past debates, he’s been so eager to go after them on a whole range of policies. In this debate, there were big sections of the night where he seemed to really fade from the foreground of this thing. And the moderators really sort of summon him to rise to this moment as a champion of the center in this race.

archived recording (joe biden) I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done.

alexander burns

He does it by describing himself as the only person on the stage who’s ever gotten big things done. He talks about the Violence Against Women Act. He talks about the Affordable Care Act. And he runs pretty quickly into quite a challenging confrontation with both Bernie Sanders and Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington —

maggie haberman

What ended up happening was Warren starts talking about her accomplishments. She talks about what she did after the 2008 fiscal crisis. She talks about her time at the C.F.P.B. She talks about what she wants to do.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) If we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — for the things that touch people’s lives. archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor — archived recording (joe biden) I agree —

maggie haberman

But you had Biden try to come back at Warren as she’s talking about what she did. He says, “I got you votes.”

archived recording (joe biden) I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight too.

maggie haberman

She sort of lets him finish. And there’s a pause, and you can see her almost drawing breath.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. And I am deeply —

maggie haberman

It’s a real dagger, because it’s a reminder that so much of what Joe Biden has done in this race has been talking about Obama’s record. Biden doesn’t handle that well —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) But understand — archived recording (joe biden) You did a hell of a job at your job. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Thank you. But understand this —

maggie haberman

— gets unhappy about it and pushes back that you did well in the role that you were in, meaning at the C.F.P.B. And there was just silence in the debate hall when he did it. It underscored what I think has been a theme for Biden in this race and certainly throughout the night when he was present onstage, which is it had this aura of don’t you understand that this is my turn, this is what I’m due? And it reminded me so much of what we would see with Hillary Clinton in 2016.

I think it was also just a total mismanagement by Biden of the dynamics of interacting with an emerging female front-runner in this race. That there was really no need, if you look at the record that he is standing on, for him to then try to sort of take a piece of her signature achievement, the creation of this new regulatory agency. And I think it was a reflection of her sort of lack of interest in escalating a fight with him, her sort of view that it didn’t make sense for her to sort of get into an extended fight with Joe Biden, that she didn’t come back at him harder on that front. It was a real role reversal from what we’ve seen in the race previously, where Joe Biden sort of goes from being the hunted to being the hunter as he sort of loses some traction at the top of this race.

Tell people what it’s going to cost, how are you going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done.

Alex, given the sensitive moment that Joe Biden is in right now with the president’s attacks on him and his son, is there an argument to be made that the best thing that could happen to Biden during this debate was kind of exactly what did happen? That he got to kind of hide away a little bit while all the moderates went after somebody else, Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

I think you can make the case that the best-case scenario for Biden at this point is to sort of protect the base that he has right now, hold steady, and trust the rest of the field to stay fractured. And if that’s the best case for him, then maybe that’s what he did tonight. I think it’s a really, really risky strategy, because it counts on everybody else being ineffective at appealing to the voters who are currently supporting you. So I think you could look at this as a low-risk debate for Biden, where he probably didn’t do damage to himself actively. I think you could also see it as a real missed opportunity for a guy who does have unmatched foreign policy credentials on that stage, who has been victimized by the president in a way that has launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump —

On Tuesday, George Kent, a senior State Department adviser on Ukraine, went up to Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment proceedings. In Kent’s testimony, he says that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told him not to worry about Ukraine policy. Obviously, a little weird for a State Department official who specializes in Ukraine policy.

Yet another odd way that the administration was handling its policy towards Ukraine. In the middle of this testimony, Giuliani himself puts out a letter that says that he is not going to comply with a subpoena from the House. The impeachment investigators want to talk to him.

Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator, said that while his “Medicare for all” health care plan would require tax increases on middle-class families, their overall spending would go down.

What Mr. Sanders said:

“I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up significantly for the wealthy and for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.”

This lacks evidence. Mr. Sanders’s health care plan would substantially increase the amount that the federal government spends. Estimates of its precise cost vary, but according to an estimate from the conservative Mercatus Center, which Mr. Sanders has mentioned approvingly, federal spending would need to increase by about 10 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, triple what the government spends on the military. But under Medicare for all, Americans who currently pay health insurance premiums or pay directly when they go to the doctor or pharmacy would be relieved of those costs. For most American families, that would be a substantial savings.

But that does not mean that “virtually everybody” would end up paying less over all. Mr. Sanders has suggested various possible tax increases that could pay for this expansion, including a payroll tax that would affect workers across the economic spectrum. He has not provided enough details about the mix and magnitude of taxes for economists to measure what sorts of families would be better or worse off under Medicare for all. An Urban Institute analysis of Mr. Sanders’s 2016 health care proposal, which included more tax details, found that the proposed taxes would only pay for about half of the cost of the plan.

What they’re talking about

Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, repeatedly avoided answering a question about whether financing her health care plan would require middle-class tax increases, saying instead that their “costs” would not go up.

What Ms. Warren said:

“I have made clear what my principles are here. And that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down.”

Ms. Warren has indeed proposed a number of large tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, including a new wealth tax, a corporate profits tax and an expansion of Social Security taxes up the income spectrum. But she has also earmarked close to all of the revenue raised by those taxes to pay for other domestic spending priorities, including free public college tuition and child care subsidies.

A Medicare for all health care program, like the one from Mr. Sanders that Ms. Warren has co-sponsored, would require substantial additional government spending. Ms. Warren would not say who would pay tax increases necessary to fund it. But it may be hard to squeeze that much more money out of the rich and corporations alone, beyond the new taxes she has already suggested. Her language about “costs” does provide the possibility that she would raise middle-class taxes, but ensure that middle-class families would save enough on health care spending to come out ahead."

At the same time, others like Ms. Gabbard, have been careful to endorse only the impeachment inquiry and not necessarily impeachment itself.

Below is a partial transcript of the exchange on impeachment at Tuesday night’s Democratic debate:

WARREN: Sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics. I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry. When I made the decision to run for president, I certainly didn’t think it was going to be about impeachment. But when the Mueller report came out, I read it, all 442 pages. And when I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown ... that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly. And so at that moment, I called for opening an impeachment inquiry. Now, that didn’t happen and look what happened as a result. Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke it again this fall.

You know, we took a constitutional oath, and that is that no one is above the law, and that includes the President of the United States. Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences. This is about Donald Trump. But understand, it’s about the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country. The impeachment must go forward.

ANDERSON COOPER: Thank you, Senator Warren. You’re all going to get in on this, by the way. Senator Sanders, do Democrats have any choice but to impeach? Please respond."

“Oh my,” Patti Solis Doyle, who served as Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager in 2008, remarked when the figures were first posted on Twitter.

Mr. Biden’s treasury now ranks fifth in the Democratic field, also behind Senator Kamala Harris of California, who had $10.5 million in the bank, though her $911,000 in unpaid bills — to her pollster, media buyer and lawyers, among others — meant that her functional cash on hand was closer to $9.6 million. (Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg reported no debts.)

The self-funding billionaire Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July and reported spending $47 million , also has more financial resources than Mr. Biden heading toward the Iowa caucuses, which are less than four months away.

Mr. Biden’s team has steadfastly said that it has enough cash to run the campaign it wants, and recently announced plans to spend $6 million on digital and television ads in the coming months.

“The fundamental question about fund-raising is: Do you have what you need to run your race? And we do,” said Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden.

On Friday, Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, Greg Schultz, scheduled a conference call with the campaign’s donors, presumably to reassure them about the path forward. Top fund-raisers for Mr. Biden recently gathered in Philadelphia for a full day of briefings on Mr. Biden’s strategy through Super Tuesday in early March."

Mr. Yang’s tielessness, after all, is a widely understood signifier of his tech success status; Mr. Steyer’s penchant for tartan is — well, what in the world is it?

Ties in general are increasingly seen as relics of the former establishment, but in the theater of politics, they are a nod to the formality of the office and indicator of respect for the past.

When male candidates want to prove their hard working bona fides and everyday-guy-ness, they tend to lose their ties and roll up their sleeves (except for Mr. Buttigieg, who loses his jacket). When they want to appear presidential, which in a debate context is what all their costume designers — sorry, “strategic consultants” — are aiming for, the default is almost always red or blue. Those colors have all the implicit references to flag-waving patriotism, especially when placed against a white shirt, and party loyalty. When they want to push some boundaries, sometimes stripes come into play, or very occasionally, purple (a red and blue combination that suggests compromise). Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington , in his brief candidacy, favored green because, you know: climate.

Tartan, with all its connotations of Christmas, school uniforms and marching across the moor to bagpipes, may speak to a certain tradition, but it’s not a stereotypical American one, which makes it uncomfortably close to the novelty tie for many viewers."

Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage. What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

STEYER: First of all, let me say this. Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor. And the results are as shameful as Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income. It’s absolutely wrong. It’s absolutely undemocratic and unfair. I was one of the first people on this stage to propose a wealth tax. I would undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations. But there’s something else going on here that is absolutely shameful, and that’s the way the money gets split up in terms of earnings. As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor, people haven’t had a raise — 90 percent of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years.

If you took the minimum wage from 1980 and just adjusted it for inflation, you get 11 bucks. It’s seven and a quarter. If you included productivity gains of American workers, it would be over 20 bucks. There’s something wrong here. And that is that the corporations have bought our government. Our government has failed. That’s why I’m running for president. Because we’re not going to get any of the policies that everybody on this stage wants — health care, education, Green New Deal or a living wage — unless we break the power of these corporations.

BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Vice President Biden, you have warned against demonizing rich people. Do you believe that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren’s wealth tax plans do that?

BIDEN: No, look. Demonizing wealth — what I talked about is how you get things done. And the way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now. The idea — we have to start rewarding work, not just wealth. I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate of 39.5 percent. I would double it. Because guess what? Why in God’s name should someone who is clipping coupons in the stock market pay a lower tax rate than someone who in fact is, like I said — a schoolteacher and a firefighter? It’s ridiculous, and they pay a lower tax. Secondly, the idea that we, in fact, engage in this notion that there are — there’s $1.64 trillion in tax loopholes. You can’t justify at minimum $600 billion of that. We could eliminate it all. I could go into detail had I the time. Secondly — thirdly — what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the American people that we are going to raise taxes on the wealthy. We are going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not. This is one of the reasons why these debates are kind of crazy. Because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given. The fact is, everybody is right about the fact that the fourth industrial revolution is costing jobs. It is. The fact is also corporate greed, if they’re going back and not investing in their employees, they’re reinvesting in buying back their stock."

Re “Race Takes Turn as Warren Faces Barrage Onstage” (front page, Oct. 16):

After watching all the Democratic debates, I am left with the following sentiments that I believe are shared by many Democrats:

My heart is with Bernie Sanders because what he says about America and what needs to be done is absolutely true. My head is with Elizabeth Warren because she is Bernie lite, a progressive who is more electable than Bernie since she is less scary to suburban Republicans and independents. And my fear puts me with Uncle Joe, because he may be most likely to beat President Trump in the swing Rust Belt states, and the thought of four more years of Trumpism is unspeakable.

But I felt the same way about Hillary Clinton and look how that turned out.

The others do nothing for this 65-year-old longtime Democrat. So how do I vote? I don’t know.

In the 2016 presidential election, o nly a little more than half o f the students on my campus voted. A lot of my friends chose not to vote either because of a general lack of interest in politics or because they didn’t support either of the candidates.

It is also difficult for young people coming from disadvantaged backgrounds who have never felt represented to believe that socialism will ever work in our society.

How many trillion???

Mr. Biden, deploying one of his favorite rhetorical weapons against Medicare for All, said Tuesday night that the plan would cost $30 trillion, or roughly 278 Jeff Bezoses, over the next 10 years. But Mr. Sanders has pointed out that that figure is much less than what the current system is projected to cost.

The truth is that no one knows for certain whether the country’s health care costs — which in total and per person far exceed those of any other industrialized country — would go up or down under Medicare for All. Ezekiel J. Emanuel and Victor R. Fuchs explain in The Times:

Medicare for All would move money from one column (private health insurance spending) to another (federal health spending); it does not automatically increase total costs. … We have our doubts about Medicare for All. But unaffordability is not a reason to oppose it.

“In some estimates, the country would not pay more for health care,” a Times analysis of five studies found. Rather, there would be “a drastic shift in who is doing the paying.” For that reason, it is more accurate to think of Mr. Sanders’s plan not as an outlay of (imaginary) money but as a redistribution of it away from insurers, drug companies, health care providers and higher-income people.

About those taxes …

Ms. Warren has drawn criticism for her continued unwillingness during debates to say whether Medicare for All would cause taxes to go up for middle-class families. Mr. Sanders admits they would, but Ms. Warren has refused the premise of the question, emphasizing the money most taxpayers would save overall after premiums (which come out of many people’s paychecks like taxes), deductibles, co-pays and coverage gaps are eliminated.

Middle-class people would “save a lot of money on health care,” the Kaiser Family Foundation’s Larry Levitt told NPR in July. Yet how exactly their net costs would change depends on the particulars of Medicare for All’s funding plans, which neither Mr. Sanders nor Ms. Warren has fully outlined. The Times wrote in a fact check:

Mr. Sanders has suggested various possible tax increases that could pay for this expansion, including a payroll tax that would affect workers across the economic spectrum. He has not provided enough details about the mix and magnitude of taxes for economists to measure what sorts of families would be better or worse off under Medicare for all.

Why not a public option?

Americans should be allowed to keep their private health insurance, Mr. Buttigieg has argued.

“The problem, Senator Sanders, with that damn bill that you wrote, and that Senator Warren backs is that it doesn’t trust the American people,” Mr. Buttigieg said during September’s debate. “I trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you, not my way or the highway.” He elaborated on his own health care plan, which he calls “Medicare for all who want it,” in an earlier debate:

You take something like Medicare, a flavor of that, you make it available on the exchanges, people can buy in. And then if people like us are right, that that will be not only a more inclusive plan, but a more efficient plan than any of the corporate answers out there, then it will be a very natural glide path to the single-payer environment.

Critics of public option proposals point out that the path may not actually be so glide-y. That’s because the price of health care services — not insurance or pharmaceutical profits — is the primary driver of America’s ballooning health care spending. Only a single-payer system can restrain those costs, Benjamin Studebaker and Nathan J. Robinson argue in the left-wing magazine Current Affairs, because it gives the government a monopoly on access to patients. “If instead there are a large number of insurance companies, providers can play those insurance companies off each other,” they write."

To answer this question, we must first ask: Which debate are you talking about?

Let’s do, to borrow a word from Andrew Yang’s lapel pin, the math. There were 12 candidates onstage Tuesday, any of whom could have had exchanges with one or more of the others. That made for (counts on fingers) a lot of different interpersonal dynamics. The debate was scheduled for three hours, yet — even with formal opening and closing statements dispensed with — it still ran long.

So there was room for a great number of debates within this debate, sponsored by CNN and The New York Times. This debate had many rooms. It had geologic ages. I believe that somewhere in there, they awarded the Oscar for Best Picture. It is said that near its beginning, the candidates argued about the merits of Medicare for All and how to pay for it, but those are only rumors; no written records remain from that time.

This ultramegasupersized format was the product of the decisions, first, to re-loosen the qualifications that had been tightened for the September debate, where only 10 made the stage, and second, to hold it all on one night, at “Lord of the Rings” length, with as many participants as there are signs of the zodiac.

Focusing only on taxes is pointless. But in a larger way, she’s wrong.

The No. 1 reason to question her version of Medicare for All — in which private health insurance would be eliminated — is its political viability. It would be an enormous disruption to the health care system, and history shows that health care disruptions are very hard to pass and usually unpopular at first. Polls show that her plan is already unpopular, and it would be a bigger disruption than Obamacare or Bill Clinton’s failed plan.

Given all that, she needs to engage with the political realities — with how she would overcome people’s resistance to giving up their health insurance for a larger new program that, yes, would require a tax increase.

I think Warren has run an excellent campaign on the whole, and I think she has the most thoughtful agenda for addressing the stagnating living standards of most Americans. I’m surprised that she has chosen to focus so much of her candidacy on the most aggressive version of Medicare for All. But she has. Now it’s time for her to tell voters how she will deal with the politics of passing it.

In my view, her best answer involves finding a way to signal her openness to a transition, in which people who want to keep their private insurance can do so (and taxes don’t yet need to rise) while Medicare initially expands voluntarily. That idea is hugely popular."

Some candidates have more maneuvering room than others to challenge the two leaders: Whereas Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders are flush with cash, Ms. Klobuchar is in a far more tenuous financial position and has yet to qualify for the debate in November. At least a few other candidates who took an assertive approach Tuesday are in similar straits, straining to raise money or meet the debate threshold or both.

What could prove decisive in Iowa, and beyond, is if centrist voters coalesce behind a single candidate or fracture among the group of hopefuls presenting themselves as pragmatists. If Mr. Biden cannot recover a measure of momentum, but holds on to enough support to block other candidates from building a coalition of more moderate Democrats, it could allow Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders to roll through the earliest primaries and caucuses with relatively weak opposition.

This scenario, of a sort of zombie Biden candidacy, is what most alarms supporters of other center-left Democrats in the race.

Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, a close ally of Mr. Buttigieg, predicted the South Bend mayor would now “dig down deep in Iowa and New Hampshire,” carrying his message from the debate — a combination of uplifting rhetoric about the future and blunt criticism of certain progressive policies — into the early states where he’s polling in fourth place.

How many trillion???

Mr. Biden, deploying one of his favorite rhetorical weapons against Medicare for All, said Tuesday night that the plan would cost $30 trillion, or roughly 278 Jeff Bezoses, over the next 10 years. But Mr. Sanders has pointed out that that figure is much less than what the current system is projected to cost.

The truth is that no one knows for certain whether the country’s health care costs — which in total and per person far exceed those of any other industrialized country — would go up or down under Medicare for All. Ezekiel J. Emanuel and Victor R. Fuchs explain in The Times:

Medicare for All would move money from one column (private health insurance spending) to another (federal health spending); it does not automatically increase total costs. … We have our doubts about Medicare for All. But unaffordability is not a reason to oppose it.

“In some estimates, the country would not pay more for health care,” a Times analysis of five studies found. Rather, there would be “a drastic shift in who is doing the paying.” For that reason, it is more accurate to think of Mr. Sanders’s plan not as an outlay of (imaginary) money but as a redistribution of it away from insurers, drug companies, health care providers and higher-income people.

About those taxes …

Ms. Warren has drawn criticism for her continued unwillingness during debates to say whether Medicare for All would cause taxes to go up for middle-class families. Mr. Sanders admits they would, but Ms. Warren has refused the premise of the question, emphasizing the money most taxpayers would save overall after premiums (which come out of many people’s paychecks like taxes), deductibles, co-pays and coverage gaps are eliminated.

Middle-class people would “save a lot of money on health care,” the Kaiser Family Foundation’s Larry Levitt told NPR in July. Yet how exactly their net costs would change depends on the particulars of Medicare for All’s funding plans, which neither Mr. Sanders nor Ms. Warren has fully outlined. The Times wrote in a fact check:

Mr. Sanders has suggested various possible tax increases that could pay for this expansion, including a payroll tax that would affect workers across the economic spectrum. He has not provided enough details about the mix and magnitude of taxes for economists to measure what sorts of families would be better or worse off under Medicare for all.

Why not a public option?

Americans should be allowed to keep their private health insurance, Mr. Buttigieg has argued.

“The problem, Senator Sanders, with that damn bill that you wrote, and that Senator Warren backs is that it doesn’t trust the American people,” Mr. Buttigieg said during September’s debate. “I trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you, not my way or the highway.” He elaborated on his own health care plan, which he calls “Medicare for all who want it,” in an earlier debate:

You take something like Medicare, a flavor of that, you make it available on the exchanges, people can buy in. And then if people like us are right, that that will be not only a more inclusive plan, but a more efficient plan than any of the corporate answers out there, then it will be a very natural glide path to the single-payer environment.

Critics of public option proposals point out that the path may not actually be so glide-y. That’s because the price of health care services — not insurance or pharmaceutical profits — is the primary driver of America’s ballooning health care spending. Only a single-payer system can restrain those costs, Benjamin Studebaker and Nathan J. Robinson argue in the left-wing magazine Current Affairs, because it gives the government a monopoly on access to patients. “If instead there are a large number of insurance companies, providers can play those insurance companies off each other,” they write."

michael barbaro

Alex Burns, we’re going to do something a little bit different here. My colleague, “Daily” producer Jessica Cheung, went to this Bernie Sanders rally over the weekend in Queens, New York. And she recorded everything that she heard.

jessica cheung What’s the sign say? speaker It’s 2016, Bernie. jessica cheung It’s whited out.

michael barbaro

And it felt to her and it felt to us that she had really picked the right Bernie Sanders rally to attend, if you’re going to attend just one.

alexander burns

She really did. This came at a huge moment for the Sanders campaign. It was a huge test for the Sanders campaign.

archived recording (bernie sanders) We got a permit for 20,000 people, and we had to close the doors.

alexander burns

It has been a tough stretch for Bernie Sanders. He had a heart attack.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I am happy to report to you that I am more than ready.

alexander burns

He was off the trail for a couple of weeks ahead of this rally, with the exception of the debate in Ohio. Before the heart attack, the race was showing signs of becoming, really, a two-candidate contest between Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden. And Sanders was really struggling to show that he still had a path to win this thing — not just to be relevant, but to win this thing. And so these forces really converge in Queens.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Are you willing to fight for that person who you don’t even know as much as you’re willing to fight for yourself? [CHEERING]

alexander burns

And he delivers a speech that is in most respects not thematically groundbreaking. It’s about the big ideas of his campaign.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Today in America, half of our population is living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to pay their rents, their mortgages, their light bill, or fix their car.

alexander burns

Economic inequality, “Medicare for all,” corruption in Washington and on Wall Street. But he rolls out one of the biggest endorsements a progressive candidate can get, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and delivers his message with a force that is intended to really convey the idea that Bernie is back.

michael barbaro

In fact, I think he says —

archived recording (bernie sanders) To put it bluntly, I am back.

michael barbaro

— I’m back.

archived recording (CHANTING) Bernie’s back. Bernie’s back. Bernie’s back. Bernie’s back.

michael barbaro

Which is an acknowledgment, of course, that he needs a comeback.

alexander burns

Right, I think he has really resisted the idea that he has fallen behind in this race, but it’s manifestly clear that he has. And from his body language, from his rhetoric, from the way his campaign is now approaching the early states and big events like this one, it’s clear that they know he does need a comeback.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I am more than ready to assume the office of president of the United States. [CHEERING]

michael barbaro

And because his campaign is at this pivotal moment, we wanted to better understand his supporters and the nature of his support. What somebody who shows up at a Bernie Sanders rally thinks about Sanders, how they talk about him, and what that means for the Democratic primary. So that’s what Jessica ended up asking voters about, and so I want to play that for you.

jessica cheung What about him excites you? speaker 1 Bernie is the true progressive — the only true progressive — running in the race. speaker 2 Bernie doesn’t say, leave it to me. Bernie says, come with me. We must join forces to create the fundamental changes required in this society. speaker 3 If you look at Bernie’s record, Bernie has been just saying the same things since pretty much, like, the ‘60s or whenever he came into public office. jessica cheung The ‘80s. speaker 3 Yeah, sorry. jessica cheung It’s OK. speaker 3 The ‘80s, but the country moved around him. And so I think now, there’s a lot of people that are, like, jumping onto the bandwagon, and so I really just think it’s the strength of Bernie Sanders and his platform. speaker 4 He’s a prophet. He knows the way forward.

alexander burns

What you hear there is just the extraordinary stature that Sanders commands on the left. The real fruits of that campaign that he ran in 2015 and 2016, when he got out there into an ideological space that other Democrats were just not comfortable entering and ran an insurgent campaign against the party establishment in a way that most Democrats had really never seen before. So I think you rarely hear candidates referred to us as prophets, but even stopping short of that sort of quasi-religious language, the depth of commitment to Bernie Sanders among his supporters probably exceeds the bond that any other candidate in the race has with their voters.

michael barbaro

Greater even than Trump, or you mean greater even than anyone on the Democratic field?

alexander burns

On the Democratic side, I should say. It is probably closer to Trump than to any of the other Democrats.

michael barbaro

That’s fascinating. But I mean, at the end of the day, a vote is a vote no matter how enthusiastically someone casts it, right? So I wonder what this kind of next-level devotion means for his candidacy.

alexander burns

Well, it has meant that even in what was a very lean summer for him — just a challenging political time where he was being eclipsed by another candidate on the left, Elizabeth Warren — he has never really been at risk of being irrelevant in this race, of being truly sidelined, because right now, it looks like anywhere between 10 percent and 17 or 18 percent of the Democratic Party is very, very tightly bonded to Bernie Sanders.

michael barbaro

One out of five Democrats?

alexander burns

One out of five on a good day. Closer to one out of 10 on a bad day. But still, on his worst day, he’s got more support in the party than every other candidate in the race, except for Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. That’s a pretty good place to be. And his support is different from any other candidate in the race. It is particularly strong among young people. There’s the irony of the Bernie Sanders campaign — the guy who would be the oldest president ever, the oldest candidate in this race, his strongest age group is the youngest age group in the Democratic electorate. What it has also meant is that he has this incredible flow of cash into his campaign, almost irrespective of whatever else is happening in this race. He has a small donor online fundraising machine that has collected tens of millions of dollars for him every quarter that he has been in this race. And in the most recent quarter, he was the number one fundraiser in the Democratic field. That’s an extraordinary thing to say about a candidate who isn’t running a super PAC, isn’t holding conventional big donor events, and is running on Democratic socialism — that he’s the best-funded candidate in the race.

michael barbaro

Right. So his fundraising is outpacing his polling, which, correct me if I’m wrong, is quite unusual in politics.

alexander burns

Right. And you basically only see it when you have these candidates who have a limited but unbelievably passionate base of support.

michael barbaro

So it feels like Bernie Sanders is kind of a test case for why genuine enthusiasm matters so much in politics.

alexander burns

His supporters are willing to do things for him that other candidate’s supporters may not be. He is going to have an easier time staying financially competitive, mobilizing volunteers, and especially in some of these early voting, cold weather states in February, getting them to actually show up and caucus in Iowa in a blizzard, if necessary.

michael barbaro

They’ll do it.

alexander burns

They’ll do it.

michael barbaro

So the next thing that Jess asked voters about at this Sanders rally was this heart attack that Sanders had a couple of weeks ago.

jessica cheung This is its first rally since he just came back from a heart attack. I wonder if you think that that makes him less electable in any way? speaker 1 I don’t think age matters. I think that’s just stupid. Like, I don’t know why people care about that. speaker 2 No, because he came back stronger. And it was a routine procedure that many people go through. speaker 3 I know a lot of people that have had stents put in, and then felt better afterwards than before. And I think he looked great, so I’m going to stick with him. speaker 4 Well, the curious thing is that Bernie, having undergone this procedure, may feel, like, 110 percent better than he did before. Just the amount of literal blood flowing to his heart may give him a level of energy and stamina that he didn’t feel before he underwent the procedure. And he’s — speaker 5 I saw him play softball! speaker 6 I don’t think that our current president has the best health, so why are we worried so much about a heart attack that wasn’t a big deal? He went right back into it afterwards. speaker 7 Both George Bush Sr. and Clinton had the same operation done in their ‘60s, so — jessica cheung He’s also pushing 80, though. speaker 8 He is, but I mean, it doesn’t — I don’t — I’m not thinking about age. I’m thinking about — speaker 9 There’s a pretty heavy bias against Bernie Sanders because he’s a fairly unique candidate. Like, Joe Biden’s eye exploded while we were all watching a debate, and they didn’t single him out with a question like, hey, Joe, like, why did your eye explode? Like, is it going to happen again?

michael barbaro

Did I miss something? Did Joe Biden’s eye suffer some kind of explosion?

alexander burns

There was a CNN town hall where he had some kind of burst capillary in his eye or something like that. It was unsightly, but —

michael barbaro

Something did happen.

alexander burns

— not medically serious, yeah.

michael barbaro

So in summary, it feels like Sanders supporters in this crowd, they are not concerned about this heart attack. And I wonder what you think of the way it was discussed?

alexander burns

I think right after the heart attack happened, there was this moment of questioning, would Sanders persist in this race? Would his support collapse because people suddenly realize he’s almost 80 years old? Would his health become the defining issue of his candidacy? And at least for his supporters, the answer to all those things is no. They are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt on so much, and his physical health is not an exception to that. I think that you hear people giving rationalizations. It’s true that Bill Clinton had a similar operation. It was after he was the president of the United States. But the reality is a candidate having a heart attack is a really big deal. And historically, by any standard of political coverage, it is more than in bounds as a subject for scrutiny and for voters to consider. We’ve never had a president turn 80 in office before. We have two candidates in this race — two of the top three candidates in this race — would turn 80 in their first term as president if they were elected. People remember, I think, pretty well Hillary Clinton fainting at the 9/11 Memorial in the middle of the general election in 2016.

michael barbaro

I think she had pneumonia.

alexander burns

She had pneumonia. And you know, the Clinton campaign, I think, is still quite resentful of the way that was covered, but a candidate collapsing in the middle of a general election is a relevant subject for coverage. President Trump’s lack of transparency about his health has been a huge subject for coverage over the last few years. There’s enormous suspicion about whether we really know everything that we deserve to know about the president’s health. So this is not bias against Bernie Sanders, but the fact that people are inclined to see it as bias against Bernie Sanders, again, underscores the strength of his support.

michael barbaro

So you mentioned Hillary Clinton in 2016. Jessica encountered a lot of supporters who very much wanted to go back to that race and talk about what happened the last time around. And I want to play some of that.

speaker 1 We need to get Bernie elected this time around. The D.N.C. screwed him over in 2016. He was robbed of the nomination. So people want Bernie. speaker 2 I think it’s the race we needed to have in 2016. I think there’s a populist feel going on. The elites are destroying the country. And the Democrats lost because we ran an elitist. And now, it’s time to run a candidate with a multiracial working-class coalition. speaker 3 He knows that the Democrats are just as corrupt as Republicans, because there has been evidence that the D.N.C. did screw with caucuses — that in Seattle, he won by a landslide, but the delegates voted for Hillary anyway.

michael barbaro

So Alex, what do you make of that?

alexander burns

I think there are a lot of myths about the role of the D.N.C. in 2016, but the valid core to all of that is the sense among Sanders supporters — and this is really not up for debate — that the Democratic Party establishment did everything they could to give Hillary Clinton an advantage over him in that primary.

michael barbaro

Remind us of that, just so we can have it in hand.

alexander burns

You had everyone at the top of the party, including President Obama, do what they could to clear the field for Hillary Clinton. You had the leadership of the party in both houses of Congress try to clear the way for Hillary Clinton. You had other kinds of coordination between party officials who were supposed to be neutral, who were ostensibly neutral, and leaders of the Clinton campaign in ways that none of it was illegal and none of it was outside of the American political tradition, but if you’re a Bernie Sanders supporter, and you looked at that, and you felt like there ought to be an even playing field in this race, there wasn’t.

michael barbaro

I wonder how that makes a Bernie Sanders supporter relate to the Democratic Party and to everyone else in the field who identifies as a Democrat, especially if Sanders starts to falter.

alexander burns

This is one of the Trumpiest things about Bernie Sanders and his political movement — that in 2015, 2016, one of the best predictors of support for Donald Trump in the Republican primary was dislike for the Republican Party. He is obviously now come to embody the Republican Party, so that dynamic has changed, but you have a lot of people in the Democratic Party or on the left who are Democratic primary voters supporting Bernie Sanders and do not like the Democratic Party. It’s something that really frustrates more mainline Democrats — that they feel like Bernie is this interloper who is sort of rousing the left against the only party that really speaks to them. But if you are a Bernie Sanders supporter, you look at the traditional Democratic Party establishment as a collection of people and ideas that have failed.

[music]

michael barbaro

And what about the candidates?

alexander burns

Well, that is one of the great questions of this race — if Bernie is not the nominee, whether his core supporters will embrace another candidate with similar enthusiasm.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

jessica cheung One of the candidates, Elizabeth Warren, shares very similar policy positions. She’s also a liberal populist. I wonder what makes you continue your support for Bernie over Elizabeth Warren? speaker 1 Warren calls herself a capitalist, and she’s not out for a political revolution. I don’t know if I trust Warren. speaker 2 It’s hard to believe her when she still doesn’t have a Medicare for all policy on her website. speaker 3 It seems like now that she’s kind of just adopting a lot of the things that he was saying his whole life, pretty much. speaker 4 She is taking all of Bernie’s policies and kind of putting a spin on it. And it’s like, do you have any original ideas? And if she believed in these things, why wasn’t she supporting them four years ago? speaker 5 And you know, Warren used to be a Republican. speaker 6 Warren used to be a Republican. speaker 7 She was a Republican, and so, like, Elizabeth Warren, I feel like, is just a watered-down form of Bernie to try to make her more appealing, but the second the primary is over, she’s just going to pivot.

michael barbaro

Well?

alexander burns

Look, that’s really striking. She’s not been a Republican since I was in primary school, which was a while ago. But the fact that Sanders supporters have latched onto that in the way they have, I think, reflects just the gap in trust between how they feel about Bernie and how they feel about almost literally any other politician, certainly any other politician running for president.

michael barbaro

It still feels surprising to hear Sanders supporters attempt to differentiate a Democratic rival who, on paper, is so ideologically similar.

alexander burns

I think there are some important ideological distinctions, at least in the abstract. That I think in Elizabeth Warren’s ideal world, we would be a heavily regulated, heavily enforced, free-market economy — that it would be something similar to an F.D.R., Teddy Roosevelt kind regulatory regime. Bernie Sanders would, I think in his ideal world, have us much closer to a sort of Scandinavian social democracy, which is a really fundamentally different way of approaching government. And part of this is a dynamic that happens in primaries generally — that the candidates who are ideologically closest together can end up having the most sort of intense hostility between their supporters because they feel like only one of these people can emerge from this. And they’re right. But there is I think also a level of seeing the trees, but not the forest here, where you have the number two and number three candidates in this Democratic primary, if they were nominated, would be the most liberal nominee in, certainly, my lifetime and in lifetimes a good deal longer than mine as well. So the level of frustration does seem sort of out of proportion to what the downside of an Elizabeth Warren nomination would be.

michael barbaro

So Alex, to your point about the forest for the trees, Jess asked a lot of these voters, if Sanders doesn’t win, are you fine voting for anybody else in the party who becomes the nominee? And this is what people said.

jessica cheung And who is your second candidate of choice? speaker 1 Elizabeth Warren. speaker 2 If Bernie can’t make it, I’m happy with Elizabeth. speaker 3 If either Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders win the nomination, I would be so happy. And I think it would be, again, a sign of how much the Democratic Party is shifting. speaker 4 I do like Elizabeth Warren’s policies. And like, if Elizabeth Warren is the nominee, I’ll happily vote for her.

michael barbaro

So a lot of them, despite their skepticism of Warren, say, if I had to, I would vote for Elizabeth Warren. But then there were several voters who said that they would be very hard-pressed to turn out for anyone who wasn’t Bernie or what they consider to be kind of Bernie-lite, which is Warren.

speaker Sure, so I like Liz Warren. I think she’s probably the only other candidate I would ever even consider supporting. The rest of them, I find to be rather embarrassing. jessica cheung If it wasn’t Bernie, who’s your second candidate of choice? speaker If it wasn’t, I would probably vote for Elizabeth, if she was the candidate. I wouldn’t vote for Biden.

michael barbaro

That’s really interesting.

alexander burns

It really is. And I guess as they say in the Senate, I should revise and extend what I said about people sort of missing the forest — that you do hear people there sort of recognizing that the party as a whole has moved, that there are candidates besides Bernie, although clearly anyone else would be the second-best choice in this race for them. But I think what you heard is how hard it will be for a candidate who is not an economic populist to speak to this set of voters, that if you end up with a candidate who is an avowed centrist or a nominee who has repudiated what Bernie Sanders stands for — hasn’t just revised or watered down his views, but has rejected them and attacked them — that’s going to be a real challenge in the general election. I think one of the calculations the Democrats have traditionally made — certainly made in 2016 — is that the left will come home at the end of the day. And I think you saw in 2016, that was a risky bet to make.

michael barbaro

Right. I mean, that was a bet that just did not come true, because when Sanders supporters were asked to support Hillary Clinton, many of them did not. In fact, as we know from Times analysis, a meaningful number of them voted for Trump.

alexander burns

In the 2016 primary, it wasn’t just liberals who voted for Sanders in the Democratic primary. There were people who were just sort of disaffected and outside the system, people who wanted a populist, not necessarily somebody who is an ideological liberal as we traditionally think of it, people who just didn’t like Hillary Clinton. And then in the general election, there were people who were Democrats, who just weren’t enthusiastic. They would have turned out to vote for Bernie Sanders, would’ve volunteered for Bernie Sanders, would have donated to Bernie Sanders. And when you start to look at the margins of defeat for Hillary Clinton in the states that made the difference — Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania — could Democratic enthusiasm have turned out an additional 70,000 voters? Very possibly.

michael barbaro

So not to be too prescriptive, but based on everything you’re saying, if Joe Biden is the nominee, it will be a challenge, maybe a significant challenge, for this group of voters to be won over and transferred to him. If it is Elizabeth Warren, that will be more logical, although it will not necessarily be seamless.

alexander burns

I think that’s probably a safe bet. And if you’re Joe Biden, you know, maybe you can bring these people around, maybe you need to make up for a lack of enthusiasm on the left by winning over voters closer to the political middle, even folks on the center-right. That’s clearly a bet that candidates like Joe Biden are making — that if Bernie has his populist following that would be much more enthusiastic about him than about me, well, I have moderates who will never vote for a Democratic socialist, but who I can turn out in a general election. And in a lot of ways, this is the big strategic debate in the Democratic Party right now. We’ve talked a lot about the ideological and policy debates in the party, but sort of fundamental to the Democratic race right now is, are you better off trying to marshal a really enthusiastic and diverse coalition on the left or a more ideologically diverse coalition that is somewhat less reliant on liberal enthusiasm?

[music]

alexander burns

For whoever the nominee is in this election, and I think probably in most elections going forward, just given the ideological and demographic trajectory of the Democratic Party and the country, it’s going to be a recurring challenge for them. How do you harness what Bernie Sanders has created, while also appealing broadly to the voters that you need in order to capture the nomination, because Sanders is not actually doing that right now, and win a general election, which Sanders has never had the chance to try to do? And it’s a particularly important question when you look to the future of the Democratic Party. If you were to sort of make a bet right now about the trajectory of that party over the next few years, it will probably look more and more like the Bernie Sanders base and less and less like the coalition that defeated him in 2016 if the party stays on its current course. This is a group of voters that is very much here to stay. And the question is, do they stay as engaged and enthusiastic Democrats?

michael barbaro

Right, or do they basically start and finish their political journey with Bernie Sanders in a way that doesn’t really help the party?

alexander burns

Do they become passionate lifelong Democratic voters, volunteers, donors, or do they go back to being either casually engaged with politics, or disengaged entirely, or really sort of disgusted with the party as they were in 2016?

michael barbaro

Alex, thank you very much.

alexander burns

Thank you.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (lindsey graham) O.K., I have introduced a resolution today with Senator McConnell. And the purpose of the resolution is to let the House know that the process you’re engaging in regarding the attempted impeachment of President Trump is a substantial deviation from what the House has done in the past.

michael barbaro

The Republican campaign to challenge the legitimacy of the House impeachment inquiry escalated on Thursday, as Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina introduced a resolution condemning it as unorthodox and improper. Graham focused on the closed-door hearings led by Representative Adam Schiff, despite the fact that Republicans themselves conducted closed-door testimony during the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998. And in his latest effort to break the deadlock over Brexit after yet another major delay, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would seek a new general election in December.

archived recording (boris johnson) We’re being very, very reasonable. We’re saying if you genuinely want more time, you can have it. Here it is. But the condition for that is that we all agree to go for a general election on December the 12th.

michael barbaro

Johnson hopes that such an election would give him a popular mandate to carry out his vision of a swift Brexit, despite deep resistance within Parliament, whose support is needed for such an election. In an interview with the BBC, Johnson defended the strategy, which his opponents in Parliament say is a form of political intimidation designed to scare them into supporting his plan.

archived recording But prime minister, it’s not standard behavior. You’re essentially trying to blackmail Parliament with the threat of an election in order to ram through your bill. You could just say, fine, let’s have as long as it takes to get through this line by line in Parliament. Would that not be the responsible thing to do? archived recording (boris johnson) Now, come on. We’ve had three and a half years of this. archived recording Not looking at this bill.

But the public’s rising disgust with corruption in the Democratic administration of Mayor David Rose led to steady and significant gains for the socialists, and in 1910 they won 21 of 35 City Council seats, 14 state legislative seats and the mayor’s office. That year, Victor Berger also became the first socialist elected to Congress.

There was no need to go on a “listening tour” to find out what the working class wanted, since so many of the party’s newly elected officials were workers themselves, including the new mayor of Milwaukee, a woodcarver named Emil Seidel. The eldest of 11 children, Seidel had been forced to go to work after grammar school. He and his fellow socialists in city government — including his personal secretary, the poet Carl Sandburg — instituted dozens of measures to improve their constituents’ lives.

They installed hundreds of drinking fountains, prosecuted restaurateurs for serving tainted food and compelled factory owners to put in heating systems and toilets. Most significantly, Seidel appointed an aggressive new health commissioner, whose department oversaw a reduction of more than 40 percent in the number of cases of the six leading contagious diseases, among them scarlet fever, whooping cough and smallpox, within two years.

The most widely admired trait of the sewer socialists was their integrity. “They never were approached by the lobbyists, because the lobbyists knew it was not possible to influence these men,” William Evjue, a Republican assemblyman, said of his socialist colleagues. Chicago, 80 miles to the south, was awash in corruption for decades, while Seidel’s administration had largely cleaned up Milwaukee’s municipal government in its brief run. But Democrats and Republicans joined forces to run a single candidate against Seidel, and he and most of the city’s elected socialists were defeated in 1912. (Later that year, when Debs ran for president, Seidel was his running mate, helping the Socialist Party win 6 percent of the vote, its highest percentage ever.)

One Milwaukee socialist who survived, however, was Daniel Hoan, the city attorney, who was not up for re-election that year. In 1916, Hoan avenged the socialists’ losses by winning the mayor’s office, which he held until 1940. Hoan oversaw further public investment, including the construction of the nation’s first public housing project, Garden Homes.

During Hoan’s tenure, an urban planner named Charles Whitnall designed sewer socialism’s most enduring achievement: the Milwaukee County park system, one of the most extensive and acclaimed in the country. The city added miles of new parkland along Lake Michigan’s waterfront, which had been dominated by private mansions.

Hoan adhered to sewer socialism’s tradition of spending taxpayer money frugally. “The objective is to give the best government possible,” Hoan once said. “But not necessarily at a low tax rate — at the lowest cost that can be paid.” During the Depression, he created a voluntary program in which city employees, including Hoan, took a 10 percent pay cut to fund public works projects that put nearly 15,000 unemployed people to work."

Alex Burns, we’re going to do something a little bit different here. My colleague, “Daily” producer Jessica Cheung, went to this Bernie Sanders rally over the weekend in Queens, New York. And she recorded everything that she heard.

jessica cheung What’s the sign say? speaker It’s 2016, Bernie. jessica cheung It’s whited out.

michael barbaro

And it felt to her and it felt to us that she had really picked the right Bernie Sanders rally to attend, if you’re going to attend just one.

alexander burns

She really did. This came at a huge moment for the Sanders campaign. It was a huge test for the Sanders campaign.

It has been a tough stretch for Bernie Sanders. He had a heart attack.

alexander burns

He was off the trail for a couple of weeks ahead of this rally, with the exception of the debate in Ohio. Before the heart attack, the race was showing signs of becoming, really, a two-candidate contest between Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden. And Sanders was really struggling to show that he still had a path to win this thing — not just to be relevant, but to win this thing. And so these forces really converge in Queens.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Are you willing to fight for that person who you don’t even know as much as you’re willing to fight for yourself? [CHEERING]

And he delivers a speech that is in most respects not thematically groundbreaking. It’s about the big ideas of his campaign.

Which is an acknowledgment, of course, that he needs a comeback.

alexander burns

Right, I think he has really resisted the idea that he has fallen behind in this race, but it’s manifestly clear that he has. And from his body language, from his rhetoric, from the way his campaign is now approaching the early states and big events like this one, it’s clear that they know he does need a comeback.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I am more than ready to assume the office of president of the United States. [CHEERING]

michael barbaro

And because his campaign is at this pivotal moment, we wanted to better understand his supporters and the nature of his support. What somebody who shows up at a Bernie Sanders rally thinks about Sanders, how they talk about him, and what that means for the Democratic primary. So that’s what Jessica ended up asking voters about, and so I want to play that for you.

jessica cheung What about him excites you? speaker 1 Bernie is the true progressive — the only true progressive — running in the race. speaker 2 Bernie doesn’t say, leave it to me. Bernie says, come with me. We must join forces to create the fundamental changes required in this society. speaker 3 If you look at Bernie’s record, Bernie has been just saying the same things since pretty much, like, the ‘60s or whenever he came into public office. jessica cheung The ‘80s. speaker 3 Yeah, sorry. jessica cheung It’s OK. speaker 3 The ‘80s, but the country moved around him. And so I think now, there’s a lot of people that are, like, jumping onto the bandwagon, and so I really just think it’s the strength of Bernie Sanders and his platform. speaker 4 He’s a prophet. He knows the way forward.

alexander burns

What you hear there is just the extraordinary stature that Sanders commands on the left. The real fruits of that campaign that he ran in 2015 and 2016, when he got out there into an ideological space that other Democrats were just not comfortable entering and ran an insurgent campaign against the party establishment in a way that most Democrats had really never seen before. So I think you rarely hear candidates referred to us as prophets, but even stopping short of that sort of quasi-religious language, the depth of commitment to Bernie Sanders among his supporters probably exceeds the bond that any other candidate in the race has with their voters.

michael barbaro

Greater even than Trump, or you mean greater even than anyone on the Democratic field?

alexander burns

On the Democratic side, I should say. It is probably closer to Trump than to any of the other Democrats.

michael barbaro

That’s fascinating. But I mean, at the end of the day, a vote is a vote no matter how enthusiastically someone casts it, right? So I wonder what this kind of next-level devotion means for his candidacy.

alexander burns

Well, it has meant that even in what was a very lean summer for him — just a challenging political time where he was being eclipsed by another candidate on the left, Elizabeth Warren — he has never really been at risk of being irrelevant in this race, of being truly sidelined, because right now, it looks like anywhere between 10 percent and 17 or 18 percent of the Democratic Party is very, very tightly bonded to Bernie Sanders.

michael barbaro

One out of five Democrats?

alexander burns

One out of five on a good day. Closer to one out of 10 on a bad day. But still, on his worst day, he’s got more support in the party than every other candidate in the race, except for Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. That’s a pretty good place to be. And his support is different from any other candidate in the race. It is particularly strong among young people. There’s the irony of the Bernie Sanders campaign — the guy who would be the oldest president ever, the oldest candidate in this race, his strongest age group is the youngest age group in the Democratic electorate. What it has also meant is that he has this incredible flow of cash into his campaign, almost irrespective of whatever else is happening in this race. He has a small donor online fundraising machine that has collected tens of millions of dollars for him every quarter that he has been in this race. And in the most recent quarter, he was the number one fundraiser in the Democratic field. That’s an extraordinary thing to say about a candidate who isn’t running a super PAC, isn’t holding conventional big donor events, and is running on Democratic socialism — that he’s the best-funded candidate in the race.

michael barbaro

Right. So his fundraising is outpacing his polling, which, correct me if I’m wrong, is quite unusual in politics.

alexander burns

Right. And you basically only see it when you have these candidates who have a limited but unbelievably passionate base of support.

michael barbaro

So it feels like Bernie Sanders is kind of a test case for why genuine enthusiasm matters so much in politics.

alexander burns

His supporters are willing to do things for him that other candidate’s supporters may not be. He is going to have an easier time staying financially competitive, mobilizing volunteers, and especially in some of these early voting, cold weather states in February, getting them to actually show up and caucus in Iowa in a blizzard, if necessary.

michael barbaro

They’ll do it.

alexander burns

They’ll do it.

So the next thing that Jess asked voters about at this Sanders rally was this heart attack that Sanders had a couple of weeks ago.

jessica cheung This is its first rally since he just came back from a heart attack. I wonder if you think that that makes him less electable in any way? speaker 1 I don’t think age matters. I think that’s just stupid. Like, I don’t know why people care about that. speaker 2 No, because he came back stronger. And it was a routine procedure that many people go through. speaker 3 I know a lot of people that have had stents put in, and then felt better afterwards than before. And I think he looked great, so I’m going to stick with him. speaker 4 Well, the curious thing is that Bernie, having undergone this procedure, may feel, like, 110 percent better than he did before. Just the amount of literal blood flowing to his heart may give him a level of energy and stamina that he didn’t feel before he underwent the procedure. And he’s — speaker 5 I saw him play softball! speaker 6 I don’t think that our current president has the best health, so why are we worried so much about a heart attack that wasn’t a big deal? He went right back into it afterwards. speaker 7 Both George Bush Sr. and Clinton had the same operation done in their ‘60s, so — jessica cheung He’s also pushing 80, though. speaker 8 He is, but I mean, it doesn’t — I don’t — I’m not thinking about age. I’m thinking about — speaker 9 There’s a pretty heavy bias against Bernie Sanders because he’s a fairly unique candidate. Like, Joe Biden’s eye exploded while we were all watching a debate, and they didn’t single him out with a question like, hey, Joe, like, why did your eye explode? Like, is it going to happen again?

michael barbaro

Did I miss something? Did Joe Biden’s eye suffer some kind of explosion?

alexander burns

There was a CNN town hall where he had some kind of burst capillary in his eye or something like that. It was unsightly, but —

michael barbaro

Something did happen.

alexander burns

— not medically serious, yeah.

michael barbaro

So in summary, it feels like Sanders supporters in this crowd, they are not concerned about this heart attack. And I wonder what you think of the way it was discussed?

alexander burns

I think right after the heart attack happened, there was this moment of questioning, would Sanders persist in this race? Would his support collapse because people suddenly realize he’s almost 80 years old? Would his health become the defining issue of his candidacy? And at least for his supporters, the answer to all those things is no. They are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt on so much, and his physical health is not an exception to that. I think that you hear people giving rationalizations. It’s true that Bill Clinton had a similar operation. It was after he was the president of the United States. But the reality is a candidate having a heart attack is a really big deal. And historically, by any standard of political coverage, it is more than in bounds as a subject for scrutiny and for voters to consider. We’ve never had a president turn 80 in office before. We have two candidates in this race — two of the top three candidates in this race — would turn 80 in their first term as president if they were elected. People remember, I think, pretty well Hillary Clinton fainting at the 9/11 Memorial in the middle of the general election in 2016.

michael barbaro

I think she had pneumonia.

alexander burns

She had pneumonia. And you know, the Clinton campaign, I think, is still quite resentful of the way that was covered, but a candidate collapsing in the middle of a general election is a relevant subject for coverage. President Trump’s lack of transparency about his health has been a huge subject for coverage over the last few years. There’s enormous suspicion about whether we really know everything that we deserve to know about the president’s health. So this is not bias against Bernie Sanders, but the fact that people are inclined to see it as bias against Bernie Sanders, again, underscores the strength of his support.

michael barbaro

So you mentioned Hillary Clinton in 2016. Jessica encountered a lot of supporters who very much wanted to go back to that race and talk about what happened the last time around. And I want to play some of that.

speaker 1 We need to get Bernie elected this time around. The D.N.C. screwed him over in 2016. He was robbed of the nomination. So people want Bernie. speaker 2 I think it’s the race we needed to have in 2016. I think there’s a populist feel going on. The elites are destroying the country. And the Democrats lost because we ran an elitist. And now, it’s time to run a candidate with a multiracial working-class coalition. speaker 3 He knows that the Democrats are just as corrupt as Republicans, because there has been evidence that the D.N.C. did screw with caucuses — that in Seattle, he won by a landslide, but the delegates voted for Hillary anyway.

michael barbaro

So Alex, what do you make of that?

alexander burns

I think there are a lot of myths about the role of the D.N.C. in 2016, but the valid core to all of that is the sense among Sanders supporters — and this is really not up for debate — that the Democratic Party establishment did everything they could to give Hillary Clinton an advantage over him in that primary.

michael barbaro

Remind us of that, just so we can have it in hand.

alexander burns

You had everyone at the top of the party, including President Obama, do what they could to clear the field for Hillary Clinton. You had the leadership of the party in both houses of Congress try to clear the way for Hillary Clinton. You had other kinds of coordination between party officials who were supposed to be neutral, who were ostensibly neutral, and leaders of the Clinton campaign in ways that none of it was illegal and none of it was outside of the American political tradition, but if you’re a Bernie Sanders supporter, and you looked at that, and you felt like there ought to be an even playing field in this race, there wasn’t.

michael barbaro

I wonder how that makes a Bernie Sanders supporter relate to the Democratic Party and to everyone else in the field who identifies as a Democrat, especially if Sanders starts to falter.

alexander burns

This is one of the Trumpiest things about Bernie Sanders and his political movement — that in 2015, 2016, one of the best predictors of support for Donald Trump in the Republican primary was dislike for the Republican Party. He is obviously now come to embody the Republican Party, so that dynamic has changed, but you have a lot of people in the Democratic Party or on the left who are Democratic primary voters supporting Bernie Sanders and do not like the Democratic Party. It’s something that really frustrates more mainline Democrats — that they feel like Bernie is this interloper who is sort of rousing the left against the only party that really speaks to them. But if you are a Bernie Sanders supporter, you look at the traditional Democratic Party establishment as a collection of people and ideas that have failed.

[music]

michael barbaro

And what about the candidates?

alexander burns

Well, that is one of the great questions of this race — if Bernie is not the nominee, whether his core supporters will embrace another candidate with similar enthusiasm.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

jessica cheung One of the candidates, Elizabeth Warren, shares very similar policy positions. She’s also a liberal populist. I wonder what makes you continue your support for Bernie over Elizabeth Warren? speaker 1 Warren calls herself a capitalist, and she’s not out for a political revolution. I don’t know if I trust Warren. speaker 2 It’s hard to believe her when she still doesn’t have a Medicare for all policy on her website. speaker 3 It seems like now that she’s kind of just adopting a lot of the things that he was saying his whole life, pretty much. speaker 4 She is taking all of Bernie’s policies and kind of putting a spin on it. And it’s like, do you have any original ideas? And if she believed in these things, why wasn’t she supporting them four years ago? speaker 5 And you know, Warren used to be a Republican. speaker 6 Warren used to be a Republican. speaker 7 She was a Republican, and so, like, Elizabeth Warren, I feel like, is just a watered-down form of Bernie to try to make her more appealing, but the second the primary is over, she’s just going to pivot.

michael barbaro

Well?

alexander burns

Look, that’s really striking. She’s not been a Republican since I was in primary school, which was a while ago. But the fact that Sanders supporters have latched onto that in the way they have, I think, reflects just the gap in trust between how they feel about Bernie and how they feel about almost literally any other politician, certainly any other politician running for president.

michael barbaro

It still feels surprising to hear Sanders supporters attempt to differentiate a Democratic rival who, on paper, is so ideologically similar.

alexander burns

I think there are some important ideological distinctions, at least in the abstract. That I think in Elizabeth Warren’s ideal world, we would be a heavily regulated, heavily enforced, free-market economy — that it would be something similar to an F.D.R., Teddy Roosevelt kind regulatory regime. Bernie Sanders would, I think in his ideal world, have us much closer to a sort of Scandinavian social democracy, which is a really fundamentally different way of approaching government. And part of this is a dynamic that happens in primaries generally — that the candidates who are ideologically closest together can end up having the most sort of intense hostility between their supporters because they feel like only one of these people can emerge from this. And they’re right. But there is I think also a level of seeing the trees, but not the forest here, where you have the number two and number three candidates in this Democratic primary, if they were nominated, would be the most liberal nominee in, certainly, my lifetime and in lifetimes a good deal longer than mine as well. So the level of frustration does seem sort of out of proportion to what the downside of an Elizabeth Warren nomination would be.

michael barbaro

So Alex, to your point about the forest for the trees, Jess asked a lot of these voters, if Sanders doesn’t win, are you fine voting for anybody else in the party who becomes the nominee? And this is what people said.

jessica cheung And who is your second candidate of choice? speaker 1 Elizabeth Warren. speaker 2 If Bernie can’t make it, I’m happy with Elizabeth. speaker 3 If either Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders win the nomination, I would be so happy. And I think it would be, again, a sign of how much the Democratic Party is shifting. speaker 4 I do like Elizabeth Warren’s policies. And like, if Elizabeth Warren is the nominee, I’ll happily vote for her.

michael barbaro

So a lot of them, despite their skepticism of Warren, say, if I had to, I would vote for Elizabeth Warren. But then there were several voters who said that they would be very hard-pressed to turn out for anyone who wasn’t Bernie or what they consider to be kind of Bernie-lite, which is Warren.

speaker Sure, so I like Liz Warren. I think she’s probably the only other candidate I would ever even consider supporting. The rest of them, I find to be rather embarrassing. jessica cheung If it wasn’t Bernie, who’s your second candidate of choice? speaker If it wasn’t, I would probably vote for Elizabeth, if she was the candidate. I wouldn’t vote for Biden.

michael barbaro

That’s really interesting.

alexander burns

It really is. And I guess as they say in the Senate, I should revise and extend what I said about people sort of missing the forest — that you do hear people there sort of recognizing that the party as a whole has moved, that there are candidates besides Bernie, although clearly anyone else would be the second-best choice in this race for them. But I think what you heard is how hard it will be for a candidate who is not an economic populist to speak to this set of voters, that if you end up with a candidate who is an avowed centrist or a nominee who has repudiated what Bernie Sanders stands for — hasn’t just revised or watered down his views, but has rejected them and attacked them — that’s going to be a real challenge in the general election. I think one of the calculations the Democrats have traditionally made — certainly made in 2016 — is that the left will come home at the end of the day. And I think you saw in 2016, that was a risky bet to make.

michael barbaro

Right. I mean, that was a bet that just did not come true, because when Sanders supporters were asked to support Hillary Clinton, many of them did not. In fact, as we know from Times analysis, a meaningful number of them voted for Trump.

alexander burns

In the 2016 primary, it wasn’t just liberals who voted for Sanders in the Democratic primary. There were people who were just sort of disaffected and outside the system, people who wanted a populist, not necessarily somebody who is an ideological liberal as we traditionally think of it, people who just didn’t like Hillary Clinton. And then in the general election, there were people who were Democrats, who just weren’t enthusiastic. They would have turned out to vote for Bernie Sanders, would’ve volunteered for Bernie Sanders, would have donated to Bernie Sanders. And when you start to look at the margins of defeat for Hillary Clinton in the states that made the difference — Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania — could Democratic enthusiasm have turned out an additional 70,000 voters? Very possibly.

michael barbaro

So not to be too prescriptive, but based on everything you’re saying, if Joe Biden is the nominee, it will be a challenge, maybe a significant challenge, for this group of voters to be won over and transferred to him. If it is Elizabeth Warren, that will be more logical, although it will not necessarily be seamless.

alexander burns

I think that’s probably a safe bet. And if you’re Joe Biden, you know, maybe you can bring these people around, maybe you need to make up for a lack of enthusiasm on the left by winning over voters closer to the political middle, even folks on the center-right. That’s clearly a bet that candidates like Joe Biden are making — that if Bernie has his populist following that would be much more enthusiastic about him than about me, well, I have moderates who will never vote for a Democratic socialist, but who I can turn out in a general election. And in a lot of ways, this is the big strategic debate in the Democratic Party right now. We’ve talked a lot about the ideological and policy debates in the party, but sort of fundamental to the Democratic race right now is, are you better off trying to marshal a really enthusiastic and diverse coalition on the left or a more ideologically diverse coalition that is somewhat less reliant on liberal enthusiasm?

[music]

alexander burns

For whoever the nominee is in this election, and I think probably in most elections going forward, just given the ideological and demographic trajectory of the Democratic Party and the country, it’s going to be a recurring challenge for them. How do you harness what Bernie Sanders has created, while also appealing broadly to the voters that you need in order to capture the nomination, because Sanders is not actually doing that right now, and win a general election, which Sanders has never had the chance to try to do? And it’s a particularly important question when you look to the future of the Democratic Party. If you were to sort of make a bet right now about the trajectory of that party over the next few years, it will probably look more and more like the Bernie Sanders base and less and less like the coalition that defeated him in 2016 if the party stays on its current course. This is a group of voters that is very much here to stay. And the question is, do they stay as engaged and enthusiastic Democrats?

michael barbaro

Right, or do they basically start and finish their political journey with Bernie Sanders in a way that doesn’t really help the party?

alexander burns

Do they become passionate lifelong Democratic voters, volunteers, donors, or do they go back to being either casually engaged with politics, or disengaged entirely, or really sort of disgusted with the party as they were in 2016?

michael barbaro

Alex, thank you very much.

alexander burns

Thank you.

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (lindsey graham) O.K., I have introduced a resolution today with Senator McConnell. And the purpose of the resolution is to let the House know that the process you’re engaging in regarding the attempted impeachment of President Trump is a substantial deviation from what the House has done in the past.

michael barbaro

The Republican campaign to challenge the legitimacy of the House impeachment inquiry escalated on Thursday, as Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina introduced a resolution condemning it as unorthodox and improper. Graham focused on the closed-door hearings led by Representative Adam Schiff, despite the fact that Republicans themselves conducted closed-door testimony during the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998. And in his latest effort to break the deadlock over Brexit after yet another major delay, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would seek a new general election in December.

archived recording (boris johnson) We’re being very, very reasonable. We’re saying if you genuinely want more time, you can have it. Here it is. But the condition for that is that we all agree to go for a general election on December the 12th.

michael barbaro

Johnson hopes that such an election would give him a popular mandate to carry out his vision of a swift Brexit, despite deep resistance within Parliament, whose support is needed for such an election. In an interview with the BBC, Johnson defended the strategy, which his opponents in Parliament say is a form of political intimidation designed to scare them into supporting his plan.

archived recording But prime minister, it’s not standard behavior. You’re essentially trying to blackmail Parliament with the threat of an election in order to ram through your bill. You could just say, fine, let’s have as long as it takes to get through this line by line in Parliament. Would that not be the responsible thing to do? archived recording (boris johnson) Now, come on. We’ve had three and a half years of this. archived recording Not looking at this bill.

Ms. Warren has become known for her towering stack of policy plans, having offered dozens of proposals on a wide variety of subjects. But on health care, she has not been similarly forthcoming, and her repeated refusal to say whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to help finance Medicare for all has drawn sharp criticism from some of her Democratic presidential rivals.

Given her increasing status as a front-runner in the primary race, Ms. Warren was ce rtain to continue facing challenges on the issue. For weeks, she has sidestepped questions about raising taxes, no matter who was asking and when. But it had been an open question whether it would remain politically tenable for her to continue simply aligning herself with Senator Bernie Sanders’s health care plan while declining to provide any detailed explanation of how she would pay for it.

Ms. Warren brought up the issue of Medicare for all at the end of a town-hall-style event in Iowa on Sunday afternoon. “I plan over the next few weeks to put out a plan that talks about, specifically, the cost of Medicare for all and, specifically, how we pay for it,” she told the crowd at the event, held at Simpson College."

But the public’s rising disgust with corruption in the Democratic administration of Mayor David Rose led to steady and significant gains for the socialists, and in 1910 they won 21 of 35 City Council seats, 14 state legislative seats and the mayor’s office. That year, Victor Berger also became the first socialist elected to Congress.

There was no need to go on a “listening tour” to find out what the working class wanted, since so many of the party’s newly elected officials were workers themselves, including the new mayor of Milwaukee, a woodcarver named Emil Seidel. The eldest of 11 children, Seidel had been forced to go to work after grammar school. He and his fellow socialists in city government — including his personal secretary, the poet Carl Sandburg — instituted dozens of measures to improve their constituents’ lives.

They installed hundreds of drinking fountains, prosecuted restaurateurs for serving tainted food and compelled factory owners to put in heating systems and toilets. Most significantly, Seidel appointed an aggressive new health commissioner, whose department oversaw a reduction of more than 40 percent in the number of cases of the six leading contagious diseases, among them scarlet fever, whooping cough and smallpox, within two years.

The most widely admired trait of the sewer socialists was their integrity. “They never were approached by the lobbyists, because the lobbyists knew it was not possible to influence these men,” William Evjue, a Republican assemblyman, said of his socialist colleagues. Chicago, 80 miles to the south, was awash in corruption for decades, while Seidel’s administration had largely cleaned up Milwaukee’s municipal government in its brief run. But Democrats and Republicans joined forces to run a single candidate against Seidel, and he and most of the city’s elected socialists were defeated in 1912. (Later that year, when Debs ran for president, Seidel was his running mate, helping the Socialist Party win 6 percent of the vote, its highest percentage ever.)

One Milwaukee socialist who survived, however, was Daniel Hoan, the city attorney, who was not up for re-election that year. In 1916, Hoan avenged the socialists’ losses by winning the mayor’s office, which he held until 1940. Hoan oversaw further public investment, including the construction of the nation’s first public housing project, Garden Homes.

During Hoan’s tenure, an urban planner named Charles Whitnall designed sewer socialism’s most enduring achievement: the Milwaukee County park system, one of the most extensive and acclaimed in the country. The city added miles of new parkland along Lake Michigan’s waterfront, which had been dominated by private mansions.

Hoan adhered to sewer socialism’s tradition of spending taxpayer money frugally. “The objective is to give the best government possible,” Hoan once said. “But not necessarily at a low tax rate — at the lowest cost that can be paid.” During the Depression, he created a voluntary program in which city employees, including Hoan, took a 10 percent pay cut to fund public works projects that put nearly 15,000 unemployed people to work."

Opinion Out With the Old, In With the Young

It’s not just that President Trump is a well-seasoned 73 and his three top Democratic Party challengers are also septuagenarians. The average senator is now almost 63 and the average member of the House nearly 58, making them roughly 20 years older than their average constituent, and nearly a decade older than they were in 1981.

Older people today hold disproportionate power because they have the numbers and the means to do so. People 65 and older, for example, are more than three times as likely to make political donations as those under 30. As a result, their voices, amplified by money, carry farther politically than those of the young and impecunious.

There are a lot of voices in their chorus. The American electorate is the oldest it’s been since at least 1970 and is graying at a rapid clip, with the well-off living longer than ever before. By 2034, according to the Census Bureau, the population 65 and older will exceed the population under 18; by 2060 the 65-and-older crowd is projected to have almost doubled. There are some 74 million baby boomers alone, and when election time comes, they turn out in droves. During the 2018 midterms, 64 percent of citizens ages 54 to 72 cast a ballot, compared to 31 percent of eligible voters 29 and under.

“Money, numbers and power have been inexorably accruing to the aging ‘baby boomer’ generation for the last few decades,” the political scientist John Seery warned in his 2011 book “Too Young to Run?” The trends show no signs of slowing. Migration to metropolitan centers by people who tend to be younger and more diverse, along with rural depopulation and aging, will only intensify age-based inequities given the geographic biases of the American electoral system. Call it the coming gerontocracy.

While significant divisions exist within every age cohort (many older people in this country are progressive and poor, just as some young people are rich and right-wing), the divisions between older and younger generations are becoming increasingly salient. Of course, young people are not intrinsically enlightened or virtuous compared to their elders — as someone who just turned 40, I certainly hope that’s not the case — and our society desperately needs older people to participate in public life.

But our democracy is in a moment of crisis. People are, for good reason, losing faith in institutions, parties and political processes and questioning longstanding assumptions. Everything, it seems, is up for grabs. The lack of intergenerational justice, of equity between the young and old, is an underappreciated facet of the current turmoil: A hoary establishment hoards influence, curtailing young people’s ability to effect change.

That is not to say that the faults in America’s political system are solely the result of its biases against the young; the problems we face are myriad and addressing gerontocracy won’t solve them all. But an antiquated system that produces unrepresentative leadership is ill equipped to respond to the problems of our time. And that should concern anyone committed to democratic ideals.

A profound and growing experiential divide now fuels conflicting outlooks, material interests and political priorities. Not only is the cohort of people born after 1980 much more diverse than that of Americans now entering retirement (nearly 80 percent of Americans over 65 are white, a figure that drops to around 50 percent for people between 6 and 21) they are less well-off compared to their predecessors at the same age. (Given the persistence of racial discrimination, though, diversity and precarity cannot be neatly disentangled.)

Contrary to stereotypes, polls show that young people across the political spectrum are deeply concerned about the state of the world. This concern has translated into rising youth voter turnout and a resurgence of protest movements. On a range of issues, including global warming, gun control, economic inequality, racism, immigration and trans rights, youth-led movements are creating a generational insurgency.

But this insurgency faces major obstacles. From age limits on voting and eligibility for office, to the way House districts are drawn, to the problem of money in politics, our modern political system is stacked against the young. These barriers need to be openly acknowledged and broken down.

We the (Old) People

Black and indigenous people, white men without property, women and some religious groups were all excluded from America’s original democratic compact. So were young people, though we rarely consider this fact.

In “Too Young to Run?” Professor Seery argues that the Constitution effectively treats young people as second-class citizens by imposing minimum age requirements for elected federal office: 25 for Congress, 30 for the Senate, and 35 for president. The nation’s framers, the youngest of whom was 26, Professor Seery writes, “bequeathed an age bias unto posterity by which they themselves did not fully abide,” devising rules ensuring that the country would be governed by people more senior than themselves. (The founders no doubt knew a Latin root of the word “senator,” senex, means “old man.”)

The geographically based idiosyncrasies of American democracy that the founders put in place compound the problem. On average, ballots cast by older people hold more weight and are less frequently “wasted” than those of the young. (Wasted votes are those garnered in excess of what a candidate needs to win; in our winner-take-all systems that means anything over 50 percent.) Clustered in sparsely populated states and counties, voters who are older, whiter and wealthier get a boost: Older Americans wield disproportionate sway over the Electoral College, the Senate and a gerrymandered Congress.

Migration patterns worsen these trends. A growing percentage of young people now dream of city life, but their preferences inadvertently reduce their political clout: “18 percent of rural residents are 65 or older versus 15 percent in suburban and small metro counties and 13 percent in cities,” the Pew Research Center reported last year. Millennials, concentrated in metropolitan areas, are the predominant generation of potential voters in only 86 congressional districts, while boomer voters predominate in 341. By 2040, 70 percent of Americans are expected to live in the 15 most populous states; that would mean that 70 percent of America will be represented by only 30 senators.

Not Your Grandfather’s Generation Gap

On Sept. 20, millions of people around the world took to the streets as part of the youth-led Global Climate Strike, a week of protests timed with the United Nations climate summit. The movement began when the 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg stopped attending classes to protest government failure to curb greenhouse gas emissions. (Ms. Thunberg said she was inspired by the anti-gun violence walkouts led by high school students from Parkland, Fla.)

One of the young Americans who took up Ms. Thunberg’s call to action was Haven Coleman, a 13-year-old from Colorado. A co-founder of the national group U.S. Youth Climate Strike, she began skipping school every Friday to head to the steps of the State Capitol in Denver. Older people often stop to tell her they don’t understand why she’s protesting. “Because you didn’t do it,” she replies.

The environment is one of the critical lines separating the old from the young. Baby boomers may have helped organize the first Earth Day in 1970, but back then ecological disaster was a more distant threat. Today, intimate knowledge of planetary devastation, from hurricanes to forest fires, is distressingly common. When the Colorado hills burn, Ms. Coleman’s asthma flares up.

The other critical divide is the economy. The boomers who came of age in the 1950s and ’60s benefited from boom times while millennials and Generation Z have been dogged by the aftermath of the mortgage meltdown, an underwhelming recovery and Gilded Age levels of inequality. One generation enjoyed a comparatively high minimum wage, affordable college tuition and reasonable costs of living; for everyone after, stagnating wages, ballooning student debt and unaffordable housing have become the norm.

“Millennials are less well off than members of earlier generations when they were young,” a 2018 report by economists from the Federal Reserve Board bluntly states. Other economists have shown that a household headed by someone born in 1970 has a quarter less income and 40 percent less wealth than one headed by a comparable person born in 1940. In contrast, between 1989 and 2013, only the cohort of families headed by people at least 62 saw an increase in median wealth. Older people are more likely to own property, stocks and other assets — and, consequently, to prefer policies that will keep the values of those assets high. No wonder so many young people have pivoted left, rejecting conventional wisdom about the virtues of unfettered capitalism.

Just as affluence translates into political power, being comparatively precarious creates a disempowering feedback loop. Burdened by student loans, young people are postponing home ownership, marriage and starting families. As a result, they are less likely to feel they have a stake in the communities where they live, which means they are less likely to participate politically and thus have their interests adequately represented. This puts policies overwhelmingly favored by the young at a further disadvantage.

Votes for Children

Some might argue that the problem of gerontocracy isn’t really a problem at all. Even if young people do not have equal political rights as older people, it evens out eventually; young people actually do possess the same political rights as their elders, just not yet.

The limits of this “be patient and wait your turn attitude” were on display in February, when protesters associated with the youth-led Sunrise Movement clashed with Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, then 85, over the need for a Green New Deal. In a video of the encounter, a group ranging in age from 11 to 24 insist that Ms. Feinstein is duty-bound to listen to their concerns about the warning by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that we have just over a decade to avert the worst effects of global warming. “Well, you didn’t vote for me,” the senator says, dismissing a girl who says she is 16.

For any adult with half a conscience, the senator’s remarks held up a discomfiting mirror, a reminder of our complicity in the present crisis. For younger viewers, it encapsulated a growing sense that many older people, even those who are ostensibly liberals, are dangerously blasé about the future — and that their willingness to play with fire stems from their belief that they won’t live long enough to get burned.

A month after the confrontation with Ms. Feinstein went viral, getting more than 10 million views, Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts introduced a proposal to lower the federal voting age to 16. Since the era of Plato’s Republic, aged-based exclusions have almost always been justified in terms of youthful immaturity and the wisdom that comes with experience. Ms. Pressley instead highlighted the fact that young people have their own distinct experiential wisdom:

A 16-year-old will bring with them the 2019 fears that their father’s insulin will run out before the next paycheck.

A 17-year-old will bring with them the 2019 hopes to be the first in their family to earn a college degree.

A 17-year-old will bring with them a 2019 solemn vow to honor the lives of their classmates stolen by a gunman.

The proposal failed by 126 to 305, an outcome in line with the likely result if the matter was put to a popular vote: A full 75 percent of registered voters oppose enfranchising 17-year-olds; 84 percent oppose it for 16-year-olds. (Individual states, however, may lower the voting age for state and local elections.)

David Runciman, a professor of politics at Cambridge, disagrees with mainstream public sentiment. The structural disenfranchisement of young people, he argues, must be remedied by even more drastic measures. His proposal: Enfranchise everyone over the age of 6. “What’s the worst that could happen?” he asked on a podcast last year. Given the current president of the United States, it’s not clear that letting kids vote would yield worse outcomes than what adults have delivered.

For Professor Runciman, the fundamental issue is fairness. He points to the 2016 Brexit vote, in which 73 percent of the 18-24 age group cast a ballot for Remain when more than 60 percent of 65 and older voted Leave. Hundreds of thousands of people who were too young to vote will have to spend their entire lives dealing with the repercussions of a nostalgic, ill-considered decision made by people not long for this earth.

It turns out there are plenty of pragmatic reasons to lower the voting age, if not to 6 then to 16. And not just because politicians like Senator Feinstein would have to listen to kids about global warming.

Evan Hunt, 9, argued for lowering the voting age at a city council hearing in Hyattsville, Md., in 2015. Jabin Botsford/The New York Times

In 2013, Takoma Park, Md., became the first city in the United States to lower the voting age for local elections to 16. The turnout rate of 16- and 17-year-olds in the next election was nearly twice that of those 18 and older, inspiring the nearby town of Hyattsville to follow Takoma Park’s example.

Something similar happened in local elections in Norway in 2011, when 21 municipalities conducted a trial lowering the voting age from 18 to 16. A range of studies support the conclusion that 18 is not the optimal age to bestow the right to vote; people are leaving the nest and too preoccupied navigating college and work to figure out how to cast a ballot, let alone register to do so.

It is also the case that voting, though typically regarded as the paramount individual right, is actually a social affair. Research conducted in Denmark shows that having children old enough to vote at home makes their parents more likely to vote as well. And it’s habitual: Once you vote, you are more likely to do it again. A person’s first election is critical, a kind of democratic gateway drug, and it’s best to get him hooked young.

Sixteen seems a reasonable time to start. And lowering the voting age might also encourage more young people to run in the local and state races where the Constitution’s age restrictions do not apply.

Vote and Revolt

If our goal is to break the grip of the coming gerontocracy, giving more teenagers access to the ballot is a necessary but insufficient step. The inequities that result from the role of money in politics and our geographically based electoral system also need to be remedied. Otherwise, the power structure will keep pandering to older — and whiter and more affluent — voters.

To approach something resembling intergenerational justice, at least two additional transformations are required: campaign finance reform and a more proportional system of representation.

The imbalance of financial resources between the young and the old puts a generational twist on a longstanding conundrum: The concentration of political power that flows from concentration of wealth is anathema to the principle of political equality. A teenager working for minimum wage or a young parent struggling with student debt should have the same influence over her elected representatives as a retiree who has amassed a lifetime of wealth. Publicly financing elections would go a long way toward putting people of different ages on more even political footing.

At the same time, we need a new motto. Not “one person, one vote,” but “one person, one equally meaningful vote.” The Fair Representation Act proposed in the House is a step in the right direction, pointing the way to a more proportional model of congressional representation using larger multi-member districts. (The imbalances inherent to the Senate and Electoral College would need to be fixed through other means.)

Under a proportional system, if a party wins the support of 25 percent of votes cast by a given electorate, it gets 25 percent of the seats — votes are no longer “wasted” and more people are represented. Research indicates that more proportional systems may increase youth turnout by as much as 12 percentage points while also encouraging younger candidates to run for office. Larger districts would help address the problem of gerrymandering while urban-rural polarization, and the age-based inequities that stem from it, would diminish.

Some might respond that pursuing generational parity is the wrong approach. Recently, the Oxford University professor William MacAskill proposed age-weighting votes in favor of the young. By his accounting, 18- to 27- year-olds should possess six times the voting weight of someone 68 or older. Whether desirable or not, his thought experiment is provocative: Why shouldn’t those who will have to live longer with the consequences of elections have more of a say?

Such imaginative reforms are, of course, distant and unlikely prospects, which means it is incumbent on older people to find more immediate ways to express intergenerational solidarity. Just as many men stand against patriarchy, so can older people resist the gerontocracy.

Unlike their boomer predecessors who rallied under the ageist motto “Don’t trust anyone over 30,” kids today are eager to find venerable allies. Consider the popularity of the 78-year-old democratic socialist Bernie Sanders (still the favored presidential candidate among college-aged voters) or the fact that the 73-year-old Senator Ed Markey (a co-sponsor, along with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of the Green New Deal) recently secured the endorsement of the youthful Sunrise Movement over his telegenic 39-year-old primary challenger. They may be septuagenarians but they embrace millennial priorities.

Those of us who are older, if not wiser, should take another cue from young activists. We need to support forward-looking policies, and we also need to protest.

Climate activists in Denver gathered to hear Greta Thunberg speak on Oct. 11. Marc Piscotty/Getty Images

On Oct. 11, several thousand people, including Ms. Thunberg, gathered near the Colorado Capitol. For once, Ms. Coleman wasn’t the only climate striker in sight. Addressing the crowd, she didn’t spend a moment pleading to be formally enfranchised (though she has told me she thinks 16-year-olds should be). Her overwhelming mission was to spur adults to join the revolt. “Our hard work does not absolve you of action,” she said. “Adults step up.”

Ms. Coleman’s emphasis on the power of protest is historically informed. If the past proves anything, it is that structural reforms are rarely secured through elections alone. We should see the goal of including young people in political life as part of the prolonged fight for a more robust and inclusive democracy — a system, lest we forget, based on the premise that those affected by a decision should have a say in making it. This task is all the more urgent given the concerted effort to undermine hard-won democratic gains. The generational implications of brazen attempts to shore up minority rule by shrinking and disempowering the electorate through methods such as gerrymandering, voter ID laws and dark money too often go unremarked.

In 1776, John Adams wrote that the legislature should be in miniature “an exact portrait of the people at large -- it should think, feel, reason and act like them.” Should we ever build a movement powerful enough to create a government that takes this founder at his word, the result could be astounding: a democracy in which elected officials are responsive to the full range of their constituents; universal access to college and medical care ensures an educated and healthy citizenry; and the environment protected for generations to come. Over the long term, these outcomes — and this more democratic system — would benefit the vast majority of people, young and old alike."

Some Democrats celebrate seeing Mrs. Clinton giving zero, uh, cares. Others, like Ms. Gabbard, see her criticism as a different kind of badge of honor.

She has, with considerable justice, insisted that this is a bad way to frame the discussion, since any additional taxes would be offset by savings on the huge premiums workers and their employers now pay for private insurance — on average, more than $20,000 a year for a family plan.

The right question is whether the overall costs facing U.S. families would go up or down. Warren has been claiming that for most families, they would go down, but she hasn’t offered specifics. And this vagueness, which has started to seem like evasiveness, is more of a problem for her than it might be for other politicians. As I said, Warren has made policy seriousness a key aspect of her political persona, so her fogginess on health care really stands out.

The plan in the works will presumably try to dispel that fog, but doing so will be tricky. An independent estimate from the Urban Institute (which is, for what it’s worth, left-leaning) suggests that a highly comprehensive Medicare-for-all plan, similar to what Sanders is proposing, would substantially increase overall health spending, although a more modest plan wouldn’t.

But cost isn’t the only issue — in fact, I’m not sure how important it really is, given that full abolition of private insurance remains unlikely in practice. Also, let’s get real: If Warren gets the Democratic nomination, the outcome of the general election isn’t going to hinge on dueling think tank estimates.

The election might, however, hinge on the support of people who have good private coverage and would be nervous about making a leap into the unknown, no matter how many facts and figures Warren deploys.

So what I’ll want to see is whether Warren gives herself and her party enough flexibility to assuage these concerns. I’m not sure what form that flexibility might take. Maybe something like an extended transition period, with greatly enhanced Obamacare (which might actually be politically doable) in the interim?

Whatever Warren comes up with, this is a crucial moment. There are many excellent things in her overall policy agenda; but she won’t get a chance to do those things unless she can extricate herself from what looks like a health policy trap.

Opinion Out With the Old, In With the Young

It’s not just that President Trump is a well-seasoned 73 and his three top Democratic Party challengers are also septuagenarians. The average senator is now almost 63 and the average member of the House nearly 58, making them roughly 20 years older than their average constituent, and nearly a decade older than they were in 1981.

Older people today hold disproportionate power because they have the numbers and the means to do so. People 65 and older, for example, are more than three times as likely to make political donations as those under 30. As a result, their voices, amplified by money, carry farther politically than those of the young and impecunious.

There are a lot of voices in their chorus. The American electorate is the oldest it’s been since at least 1970 and is graying at a rapid clip, with the well-off living longer than ever before. By 2034, according to the Census Bureau, the population 65 and older will exceed the population under 18; by 2060 the 65-and-older crowd is projected to have almost doubled. There are some 74 million baby boomers alone, and when election time comes, they turn out in droves. During the 2018 midterms, 64 percent of citizens ages 54 to 72 cast a ballot, compared to 31 percent of eligible voters 29 and under.

“Money, numbers and power have been inexorably accruing to the aging ‘baby boomer’ generation for the last few decades,” the political scientist John Seery warned in his 2011 book “Too Young to Run?” The trends show no signs of slowing. Migration to metropolitan centers by people who tend to be younger and more diverse, along with rural depopulation and aging, will only intensify age-based inequities given the geographic biases of the American electoral system. Call it the coming gerontocracy.

While significant divisions exist within every age cohort (many older people in this country are progressive and poor, just as some young people are rich and right-wing), the divisions between older and younger generations are becoming increasingly salient. Of course, young people are not intrinsically enlightened or virtuous compared to their elders — as someone who just turned 40, I certainly hope that’s not the case — and our society desperately needs older people to participate in public life.

But our democracy is in a moment of crisis. People are, for good reason, losing faith in institutions, parties and political processes and questioning longstanding assumptions. Everything, it seems, is up for grabs. The lack of intergenerational justice, of equity between the young and old, is an underappreciated facet of the current turmoil: A hoary establishment hoards influence, curtailing young people’s ability to effect change.

That is not to say that the faults in America’s political system are solely the result of its biases against the young; the problems we face are myriad and addressing gerontocracy won’t solve them all. But an antiquated system that produces unrepresentative leadership is ill equipped to respond to the problems of our time. And that should concern anyone committed to democratic ideals.

A profound and growing experiential divide now fuels conflicting outlooks, material interests and political priorities. Not only is the cohort of people born after 1980 much more diverse than that of Americans now entering retirement (nearly 80 percent of Americans over 65 are white, a figure that drops to around 50 percent for people between 6 and 21) they are less well-off compared to their predecessors at the same age. (Given the persistence of racial discrimination, though, diversity and precarity cannot be neatly disentangled.)

Contrary to stereotypes, polls show that young people across the political spectrum are deeply concerned about the state of the world. This concern has translated into rising youth voter turnout and a resurgence of protest movements. On a range of issues, including global warming, gun control, economic inequality, racism, immigration and trans rights, youth-led movements are creating a generational insurgency.

But this insurgency faces major obstacles. From age limits on voting and eligibility for office, to the way House districts are drawn, to the problem of money in politics, our modern political system is stacked against the young. These barriers need to be openly acknowledged and broken down.

We the (Old) People

Black and indigenous people, white men without property, women and some religious groups were all excluded from America’s original democratic compact. So were young people, though we rarely consider this fact.

In “Too Young to Run?” Professor Seery argues that the Constitution effectively treats young people as second-class citizens by imposing minimum age requirements for elected federal office: 25 for Congress, 30 for the Senate, and 35 for president. The nation’s framers, the youngest of whom was 26, Professor Seery writes, “bequeathed an age bias unto posterity by which they themselves did not fully abide,” devising rules ensuring that the country would be governed by people more senior than themselves. (The founders no doubt knew a Latin root of the word “senator,” senex, means “old man.”)

The geographically based idiosyncrasies of American democracy that the founders put in place compound the problem. On average, ballots cast by older people hold more weight and are less frequently “wasted” than those of the young. (Wasted votes are those garnered in excess of what a candidate needs to win; in our winner-take-all systems that means anything over 50 percent.) Clustered in sparsely populated states and counties, voters who are older, whiter and wealthier get a boost: Older Americans wield disproportionate sway over the Electoral College, the Senate and a gerrymandered Congress.

Migration patterns worsen these trends. A growing percentage of young people now dream of city life, but their preferences inadvertently reduce their political clout: “18 percent of rural residents are 65 or older versus 15 percent in suburban and small metro counties and 13 percent in cities,” the Pew Research Center reported last year. Millennials, concentrated in metropolitan areas, are the predominant generation of potential voters in only 86 congressional districts, while boomer voters predominate in 341. By 2040, 70 percent of Americans are expected to live in the 15 most populous states; that would mean that 70 percent of America will be represented by only 30 senators.

Not Your Grandfather’s Generation Gap

On Sept. 20, millions of people around the world took to the streets as part of the youth-led Global Climate Strike, a week of protests timed with the United Nations climate summit. The movement began when the 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg stopped attending classes to protest government failure to curb greenhouse gas emissions. (Ms. Thunberg said she was inspired by the anti-gun violence walkouts led by high school students from Parkland, Fla.)

One of the young Americans who took up Ms. Thunberg’s call to action was Haven Coleman, a 13-year-old from Colorado. A co-founder of the national group U.S. Youth Climate Strike, she began skipping school every Friday to head to the steps of the State Capitol in Denver. Older people often stop to tell her they don’t understand why she’s protesting. “Because you didn’t do it,” she replies.

The environment is one of the critical lines separating the old from the young. Baby boomers may have helped organize the first Earth Day in 1970, but back then ecological disaster was a more distant threat. Today, intimate knowledge of planetary devastation, from hurricanes to forest fires, is distressingly common. When the Colorado hills burn, Ms. Coleman’s asthma flares up.

The other critical divide is the economy. The boomers who came of age in the 1950s and ’60s benefited from boom times while millennials and Generation Z have been dogged by the aftermath of the mortgage meltdown, an underwhelming recovery and Gilded Age levels of inequality. One generation enjoyed a comparatively high minimum wage, affordable college tuition and reasonable costs of living; for everyone after, stagnating wages, ballooning student debt and unaffordable housing have become the norm.

“Millennials are less well off than members of earlier generations when they were young,” a 2018 report by economists from the Federal Reserve Board bluntly states. Other economists have shown that a household headed by someone born in 1970 has a quarter less income and 40 percent less wealth than one headed by a comparable person born in 1940. In contrast, between 1989 and 2013, only the cohort of families headed by people at least 62 saw an increase in median wealth. Older people are more likely to own property, stocks and other assets — and, consequently, to prefer policies that will keep the values of those assets high. No wonder so many young people have pivoted left, rejecting conventional wisdom about the virtues of unfettered capitalism.

Just as affluence translates into political power, being comparatively precarious creates a disempowering feedback loop. Burdened by student loans, young people are postponing home ownership, marriage and starting families. As a result, they are less likely to feel they have a stake in the communities where they live, which means they are less likely to participate politically and thus have their interests adequately represented. This puts policies overwhelmingly favored by the young at a further disadvantage.

Votes for Children

Some might argue that the problem of gerontocracy isn’t really a problem at all. Even if young people do not have equal political rights as older people, it evens out eventually; young people actually do possess the same political rights as their elders, just not yet.

The limits of this “be patient and wait your turn attitude” were on display in February, when protesters associated with the youth-led Sunrise Movement clashed with Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, then 85, over the need for a Green New Deal. In a video of the encounter, a group ranging in age from 11 to 24 insist that Ms. Feinstein is duty-bound to listen to their concerns about the warning by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that we have just over a decade to avert the worst effects of global warming. “Well, you didn’t vote for me,” the senator says, dismissing a girl who says she is 16.

For any adult with half a conscience, the senator’s remarks held up a discomfiting mirror, a reminder of our complicity in the present crisis. For younger viewers, it encapsulated a growing sense that many older people, even those who are ostensibly liberals, are dangerously blasé about the future — and that their willingness to play with fire stems from their belief that they won’t live long enough to get burned.

A month after the confrontation with Ms. Feinstein went viral, getting more than 10 million views, Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts introduced a proposal to lower the federal voting age to 16. Since the era of Plato’s Republic, aged-based exclusions have almost always been justified in terms of youthful immaturity and the wisdom that comes with experience. Ms. Pressley instead highlighted the fact that young people have their own distinct experiential wisdom:

A 16-year-old will bring with them the 2019 fears that their father’s insulin will run out before the next paycheck.

A 17-year-old will bring with them the 2019 hopes to be the first in their family to earn a college degree.

A 17-year-old will bring with them a 2019 solemn vow to honor the lives of their classmates stolen by a gunman.

The proposal failed by 126 to 305, an outcome in line with the likely result if the matter was put to a popular vote: A full 75 percent of registered voters oppose enfranchising 17-year-olds; 84 percent oppose it for 16-year-olds. (Individual states, however, may lower the voting age for state and local elections.)

David Runciman, a professor of politics at Cambridge, disagrees with mainstream public sentiment. The structural disenfranchisement of young people, he argues, must be remedied by even more drastic measures. His proposal: Enfranchise everyone over the age of 6. “What’s the worst that could happen?” he asked on a podcast last year. Given the current president of the United States, it’s not clear that letting kids vote would yield worse outcomes than what adults have delivered.

For Professor Runciman, the fundamental issue is fairness. He points to the 2016 Brexit vote, in which 73 percent of the 18-24 age group cast a ballot for Remain when more than 60 percent of 65 and older voted Leave. Hundreds of thousands of people who were too young to vote will have to spend their entire lives dealing with the repercussions of a nostalgic, ill-considered decision made by people not long for this earth.

It turns out there are plenty of pragmatic reasons to lower the voting age, if not to 6 then to 16. And not just because politicians like Senator Feinstein would have to listen to kids about global warming.

In 2013, Takoma Park, Md., became the first city in the United States to lower the voting age for local elections to 16. The turnout rate of 16- and 17-year-olds in the next election was nearly twice that of those 18 and older, inspiring the nearby town of Hyattsville to follow Takoma Park’s example.

Something similar happened in local elections in Norway in 2011, when 21 municipalities conducted a trial lowering the voting age from 18 to 16. A range of studies support the conclusion that 18 is not the optimal age to bestow the right to vote; people are leaving the nest and too preoccupied navigating college and work to figure out how to cast a ballot, let alone register to do so.

It is also the case that voting, though typically regarded as the paramount individual right, is actually a social affair. Research conducted in Denmark shows that having children old enough to vote at home makes their parents more likely to vote as well. And it’s habitual: Once you vote, you are more likely to do it again. A person’s first election is critical, a kind of democratic gateway drug, and it’s best to get him hooked young.

Sixteen seems a reasonable time to start. And lowering the voting age might also encourage more young people to run in the local and state races where the Constitution’s age restrictions do not apply.

Vote and Revolt

If our goal is to break the grip of the coming gerontocracy, giving more teenagers access to the ballot is a necessary but insufficient step. The inequities that result from the role of money in politics and our geographically based electoral system also need to be remedied. Otherwise, the power structure will keep pandering to older — and whiter and more affluent — voters.

To approach something resembling intergenerational justice, at least two additional transformations are required: campaign finance reform and a more proportional system of representation.

The imbalance of financial resources between the young and the old puts a generational twist on a longstanding conundrum: The concentration of political power that flows from concentration of wealth is anathema to the principle of political equality. A teenager working for minimum wage or a young parent struggling with student debt should have the same influence over her elected representatives as a retiree who has amassed a lifetime of wealth. Publicly financing elections would go a long way toward putting people of different ages on more even political footing.

At the same time, we need a new motto. Not “one person, one vote,” but “one person, one equally meaningful vote.” The Fair Representation Act proposed in the House is a step in the right direction, pointing the way to a more proportional model of congressional representation using larger multi-member districts. (The imbalances inherent to the Senate and Electoral College would need to be fixed through other means.)

Under a proportional system, if a party wins the support of 25 percent of votes cast by a given electorate, it gets 25 percent of the seats — votes are no longer “wasted” and more people are represented. Research indicates that more proportional systems may increase youth turnout by as much as 12 percentage points while also encouraging younger candidates to run for office. Larger districts would help address the problem of gerrymandering while urban-rural polarization, and the age-based inequities that stem from it, would diminish.

Some might respond that pursuing generational parity is the wrong approach. Recently, the Oxford University professor William MacAskill proposed age-weighting votes in favor of the young. By his accounting, 18- to 27- year-olds should possess six times the voting weight of someone 68 or older. Whether desirable or not, his thought experiment is provocative: Why shouldn’t those who will have to live longer with the consequences of elections have more of a say?

Such imaginative reforms are, of course, distant and unlikely prospects, which means it is incumbent on older people to find more immediate ways to express intergenerational solidarity. Just as many men stand against patriarchy, so can older people resist the gerontocracy.

Unlike their boomer predecessors who rallied under the ageist motto “Don’t trust anyone over 30,” kids today are eager to find venerable allies. Consider the popularity of the 78-year-old democratic socialist Bernie Sanders (still the favored presidential candidate among college-aged voters) or the fact that the 73-year-old Senator Ed Markey (a co-sponsor, along with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of the Green New Deal) recently secured the endorsement of the youthful Sunrise Movement over his telegenic 39-year-old primary challenger. They may be septuagenarians but they embrace millennial priorities.

Those of us who are older, if not wiser, should take another cue from young activists. We need to support forward-looking policies, and we also need to protest.

Climate activists in Denver gathered to hear Greta Thunberg speak on Oct. 11. Marc Piscotty/Getty Images

On Oct. 11, several thousand people, including Ms. Thunberg, gathered near the Colorado Capitol. For once, Ms. Coleman wasn’t the only climate striker in sight. Addressing the crowd, she didn’t spend a moment pleading to be formally enfranchised (though she has told me she thinks 16-year-olds should be). Her overwhelming mission was to spur adults to join the revolt. “Our hard work does not absolve you of action,” she said. “Adults step up.”

Ms. Coleman’s emphasis on the power of protest is historically informed. If the past proves anything, it is that structural reforms are rarely secured through elections alone. We should see the goal of including young people in political life as part of the prolonged fight for a more robust and inclusive democracy — a system, lest we forget, based on the premise that those affected by a decision should have a say in making it. This task is all the more urgent given the concerted effort to undermine hard-won democratic gains. The generational implications of brazen attempts to shore up minority rule by shrinking and disempowering the electorate through methods such as gerrymandering, voter ID laws and dark money too often go unremarked.

In 1776, John Adams wrote that the legislature should be in miniature “an exact portrait of the people at large -- it should think, feel, reason and act like them.” Should we ever build a movement powerful enough to create a government that takes this founder at his word, the result could be astounding: a democracy in which elected officials are responsive to the full range of their constituents; universal access to college and medical care ensures an educated and healthy citizenry; and the environment protected for generations to come. Over the long term, these outcomes — and this more democratic system — would benefit the vast majority of people, young and old alike."

He was 69.

The exact cause has not been determined, but he had been ill, a friend, James Marshall, said.

Mr. Tosches (pronounced TOSH-ez ) and his fellow music writers Richard Meltzer and Lester Bangs were labeled “the Noise Boys” for their wild, energetic prose, a world away from fan magazines like Tiger Beat. Interviewing Debbie Harry of the band Blondie in 1979 for Creem magazine, he thought nothing of asking whether she shaved or waxed her legs. Neither, it turned out; she told him she plucked them, one hair at a time.

“We speak for many minutes of legs and their lore,” he wrote. “Each of us learns a great deal from the other. A mutual respect is born.”

Mr. Tosches’ first book, “Country,” published in 1977, was a well-researched look at some of country music’s lesser-known and often roguish figures. “Unsung Heroes of Rock ’n’ Roll” followed in 1984, with chapters on Ella Mae Morse, Skeets McDonald and many more."

He started out insisting that people were misstating what he had said, but Mr. Wallace was having none of it. “You were asked specifically by Jonathan Karl [of ABC News], Was investigating Democrats one of the conditions for holding up the aid — was that part of the quid pro quo? And you said, ‘It happens all the time.’” This sent Mr. Mulvaney spinning even more furiously, to which Mr. Wallace responded, “I hate to go through this, but you said what you said.” Mr. Mulvaney could protest all he wanted. Mr. Wallace had video receipts.

The acting chief wasn’t much better at trying to explain why Mr. Trump thought it a good idea to hold the Group of 7 gathering at one of his company’s resorts. “At the end of the day, he still considers himself to be in the hospitality business,” Mr. Mulvaney said.

Reviews of Mr. Mulvaney’s Sunday gig were not kind, even among the president’s friends and advisers — one of whom characterized it to Politico as “a self-immolation.” For weeks, word around Washington has been that Mr. Mulvaney has lost favor at the White House. The past few days have kicked speculation into high gear about how much longer he can hang on.

It’s easy to mock Mr. Mulvaney’s missteps. He has emerged as one of Mr. Trump’s top go-to guys for carrying out questionable orders, such as taking the practical steps necessary to withhold Ukraine’s aid money or shove aside career diplomats in favor of political lackeys.

But, in Mr. Mulvaney’s defense, he should never have been put in this position. The guy who’s doing the dirty work should not also be the guy expected to go out and defend it to a roomful of journalists. That’s what a press secretary is for — preferably a professional steeped in the dark art of ensorcelling the Fourth Estate.

Seriously, does anyone think Sarah Huckabee Sanders, in her turn as Mr. Trump’s chief spinner, would have been goaded into admitting a presidential quid pro quo and then admonish everyone for being naïve about that sort of thing? Of course not. She was too adept at dodging, deflecting and flat-out lying to blurt out such an inconvenient truth.

Before Sanders, Debs was the most successful socialist candidate in American history, winning hundreds of thousands of votes in the final four of his five campaigns for president. He won 6 percent of the national popular vote in 1912, the equivalent, in 2016 numbers, of more than eight million votes

Debs was best known for his thundering attacks on industrial capitalism. A tireless campaigner, he crisscrossed the country denouncing the inhumane conditions of factory labor and berating the capitalist class for its destructive obsession with profit. “In the wage system you and your children, and your children’s children, if capitalism shall prevail until they are born, are condemned to slavery and there is no possible hope unless by throwing over the capitalists and voting for socialism,” Debs declared in a speech delivered at an Independence Day celebration in Chicago in 1901.

But Debs didn’t just condemn his class enemies. He also called on his audiences to imagine a better world — to realize the democratic and egalitarian promise of the American Revolution through collective action. “We live in the most favored land beneath the unbending sky,” he said in a speech in 1900. “We have all the raw materials and the most marvelous machinery, millions of eager inhabitants seeking employment. Nothing is so easily produced as wealth, and no man should suffer for the need of it.” Debs’s appeal, noted the historian Nick Salvatore in his 1982 biography, “Eugene V. Debs: Citizen and Socialist,” was “frequently described by contemporaries as evangelical, and transcended at that moment factional disagreements and led each in the audience to glimpse a different social order.”

Or, as one self-described “hard-bitten socialist” said to the journalist Heywood Broun at the time: “That old man with the burning eyes actually believes that there can be such a thing as the brotherhood of man. And that’s not the funniest part of it. As long as he’s around, I believe it myself.”"

Is Hillary Clinton trolling us?

Over the past two weeks, Mrs. Clinton has called President Trump a “corrupt human tornado.” She’s refused to appear on a panel with Kirstjen Nielsen, the former homeland security secretary best known for separating migrant children from their families. She’s picked a fight with Representative Tulsi Gabbard, suggesting that the Hawaii congresswoman and presidential candidate is a favorite of the Russians. And she’s tweeted a letter mocking Mr. Trump with language that makes it unprintable in this family newsletter.

Welcome to Hillary Unplugged.

For most of her public career, Mrs. Clinton has been constrained by the expectations of her position, be it first lady, senator or secretary of state. Now, after her stunning loss in 2016, it seems she finally feels liberated to speak her mind.

And she’s certainly stirring up a lot of drama while doing it. The two-time Democratic presidential candidate continues to loom large in the psyche of her party — both as heroine and villain.

Some Democrats celebrate seeing Mrs. Clinton giving zero, uh, cares. Others, like Ms. Gabbard, see her criticism as a different kind of badge of honor. Several people who have spoken to Ms. Gabbard say privately that her team loves the controversy, seeing Mrs. Clinton as a perfect establishment foil for their stuck-in-the-single-digits campaign."

Yet unorthodox also describes Senator Bernie Sanders on banking policy, Senator Elizabeth Warren on antitrust policy and former Representative Beto ORourke on the free … [+2027 chars]",The problem is not just paranoia. It’s also that she questioned a candidate’s motives rather than the soundness of her views.,2019-10-21,The New York Times,Why Hillary Clinton Shouldn’t Trade in Conspiracy Theories About Tulsi Gabbard,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/21/opinion/tulsi-gabbard-hillary-clinton.html,"On Friday, Hillary Clinton suggested on a podcast that the Russian government might be “grooming” Democratic Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii as a third-party presidential candidate and referred to the former Green Party candidate Jill Stein as “a Russian asset.”

Ms. Gabbard, in response, fashioned an insult for Mrs. Clinton that seemed drawn from the “Iliad,” or perhaps “Game of Thrones,” calling Mrs. Clinton “the queen of warmongers.”

Mrs. Clinton’s assertions, backed only by innuendo, verged on the conspiratorial, yet it is a sign of the times that it was hard not to wonder at least for a moment whether to take her seriously. No one can honestly doubt that the Russian government is trying to foster chaos and disunity in the United States. Certainly it has preferred presidential candidates. If the Russians think there is something to be gained by indirectly or directly supporting someone, why wouldn’t they?

You’re a conspiracy theorist, as the saying goes, only if there isn’t a conspiracy.

Even so, it is a terrible thing to label candidates as “Russian assets” based on their views alone. It actually helps create its own kind of propaganda victory for foreign rivals, by replacing serious policy debate with rumor-mongering and suggestions of disloyalty."

Journalists have been badgering Warren to get specific about how much taxes would have to go up to pay for Medicare for all. She has, with considerable justice, insisted that this is a bad way to frame the discussion, since any additional taxes would be offset by savings on the huge premiums workers and their employers now pay for private insurance — on average, more than $20,000 a year for a family plan.

The right question is whether the overall costs facing U.S. families would go up or down. Warren has been claiming that for most families, they would go down, but she hasn’t offered specifics. And this vagueness, which has started to seem like evasiveness, is more of a problem for her than it might be for other politicians. As I said, Warren has made policy seriousness a key aspect of her political persona, so her fogginess on health care really stands out.

The plan in the works will presumably try to dispel that fog, but doing so will be tricky. An independent estimate from the Urban Institute (which is, for what it’s worth, left-leaning) suggests that a highly comprehensive Medicare-for-all plan, similar to what Sanders is proposing, would substantially increase overall health spending, although a more modest plan wouldn’t.

But cost isn’t the only issue — in fact, I’m not sure how important it really is, given that full abolition of private insurance remains unlikely in practice. Also, let’s get real: If Warren gets the Democratic nomination, the outcome of the general election isn’t going to hinge on dueling think tank estimates.

The election might, however, hinge on the support of people who have good private coverage and would be nervous about making a leap into the unknown, no matter how many facts and figures Warren deploys.

So what I’ll want to see is whether Warren gives herself and her party enough flexibility to assuage these concerns. I’m not sure what form that flexibility might take. Maybe something like an extended transition period, with greatly enhanced Obamacare (which might actually be politically doable) in the interim?

Whatever Warren comes up with, this is a crucial moment. There are many excellent things in her overall policy agenda; but she won’t get a chance to do those things unless she can extricate herself from what looks like a health policy trap.

He started out insisting that people were misstating what he had said, but Mr. Wallace was having none of it. “You were asked specifically by Jonathan Karl [of ABC News], Was investigating Democrats one of the conditions for holding up the aid — was that part of the quid pro quo? And you said, ‘It happens all the time.’” This sent Mr. Mulvaney spinning even more furiously, to which Mr. Wallace responded, “I hate to go through this, but you said what you said.” Mr. Mulvaney could protest all he wanted. Mr. Wallace had video receipts.

The acting chief wasn’t much better at trying to explain why Mr. Trump thought it a good idea to hold the Group of 7 gathering at one of his company’s resorts. “At the end of the day, he still considers himself to be in the hospitality business,” Mr. Mulvaney said.

Reviews of Mr. Mulvaney’s Sunday gig were not kind, even among the president’s friends and advisers — one of whom characterized it to Politico as “a self-immolation.” For weeks, word around Washington has been that Mr. Mulvaney has lost favor at the White House. The past few days have kicked speculation into high gear about how much longer he can hang on.

It’s easy to mock Mr. Mulvaney’s missteps. He has emerged as one of Mr. Trump’s top go-to guys for carrying out questionable orders, such as taking the practical steps necessary to withhold Ukraine’s aid money or shove aside career diplomats in favor of political lackeys.

But, in Mr. Mulvaney’s defense, he should never have been put in this position. The guy who’s doing the dirty work should not also be the guy expected to go out and defend it to a roomful of journalists. That’s what a press secretary is for — preferably a professional steeped in the dark art of ensorcelling the Fourth Estate.

Seriously, does anyone think Sarah Huckabee Sanders, in her turn as Mr. Trump’s chief spinner, would have been goaded into admitting a presidential quid pro quo and then admonish everyone for being naïve about that sort of thing? Of course not. She was too adept at dodging, deflecting and flat-out lying to blurt out such an inconvenient truth. If nothing else, she would have pleaded ignorance of the details — which would have been a tougher sell for Mr. Mulvaney given his role as a recurring character in the Ukraine shenanigans.

Chicago is a heavily Democratic city with a long history of backing labor unions. As teachers have marched through downtown and picketed outside schools in recent days, they have often been greeted by supportive car honks and parents offering apple cider and doughnuts. But Ms. Lightfoot and her predecessor, Rahm Emanuel , whose tenure included an especially bitter teachers’ strike in 2012, have struggled to reconcile demands from the union with the bleak finances of the city and the school system.

“Beyond what we put on the table, there is simply no more money,” Ms. Lightfoot said, taking a noticeably harsher tone this week than in the first days of the strike. She added: “Enough is enough. There is no further excuse to keep our kids out of school.”

Ms. Lightfoot suggested that she was unsurprised by Ms. Warren’s arrival, but did not expect it to change much for the city.

“She has her right to come in,” Ms. Lightfoot said. “I would expect all Democratic candidates for the presidency to support workers. That’s who we are as a party. But at the end of the day, what’s going to get it done is what happens at the bargaining table.”

Republicans were also skeptical of the visit.

“Teachers should be wary of any advice Elizabeth Warren may be relaying today in Chicago,” said Kevin Knoth, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee , in a statement that questioned the wisdom of Ms. Warren’s plan for spending billions of dollars more on education.

michael barbaro

Alex Burns, we’re going to do something a little bit different here. My colleague, “Daily” producer Jessica Cheung, went to this Bernie Sanders rally over the weekend in Queens, New York. And she recorded everything that she heard.

jessica cheung What’s the sign say? speaker It’s 2016, Bernie. jessica cheung It’s whited out.

michael barbaro

And it felt to her and it felt to us that she had really picked the right Bernie Sanders rally to attend, if you’re going to attend just one.

alexander burns

She really did. This came at a huge moment for the Sanders campaign. It was a huge test for the Sanders campaign.

archived recording (bernie sanders) We got a permit for 20,000 people, and we had to close the doors.

alexander burns

It has been a tough stretch for Bernie Sanders. He had a heart attack.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I am happy to report to you that I am more than ready.

alexander burns

He was off the trail for a couple of weeks ahead of this rally, with the exception of the debate in Ohio. Before the heart attack, the race was showing signs of becoming, really, a two-candidate contest between Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden. And Sanders was really struggling to show that he still had a path to win this thing — not just to be relevant, but to win this thing. And so these forces really converge in Queens.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Are you willing to fight for that person who you don’t even know as much as you’re willing to fight for yourself? [CHEERING]

alexander burns

And he delivers a speech that is in most respects not thematically groundbreaking. It’s about the big ideas of his campaign.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Today in America, half of our population is living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to pay their rents, their mortgages, their light bill, or fix their car.

alexander burns

Economic inequality, “Medicare for all,” corruption in Washington and on Wall Street. But he rolls out one of the biggest endorsements a progressive candidate can get, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and delivers his message with a force that is intended to really convey the idea that Bernie is back.

michael barbaro

In fact, I think he says —

michael barbaro

— I’m back.

archived recording (CHANTING) Bernie’s back. Bernie’s back. Bernie’s back. Bernie’s back.

michael barbaro

Which is an acknowledgment, of course, that he needs a comeback.

alexander burns

Right, I think he has really resisted the idea that he has fallen behind in this race, but it’s manifestly clear that he has. And from his body language, from his rhetoric, from the way his campaign is now approaching the early states and big events like this one, it’s clear that they know he does need a comeback.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I am more than ready to assume the office of president of the United States. [CHEERING]

michael barbaro

And because his campaign is at this pivotal moment, we wanted to better understand his supporters and the nature of his support. What somebody who shows up at a Bernie Sanders rally thinks about Sanders, how they talk about him, and what that means for the Democratic primary. So that’s what Jessica ended up asking voters about, and so I want to play that for you.

jessica cheung What about him excites you? speaker 1 Bernie is the true progressive — the only true progressive — running in the race. speaker 2 Bernie doesn’t say, leave it to me. Bernie says, come with me. We must join forces to create the fundamental changes required in this society. speaker 3 If you look at Bernie’s record, Bernie has been just saying the same things since pretty much, like, the ‘60s or whenever he came into public office. jessica cheung The ‘80s. speaker 3 Yeah, sorry. jessica cheung It’s OK. speaker 3 The ‘80s, but the country moved around him. And so I think now, there’s a lot of people that are, like, jumping onto the bandwagon, and so I really just think it’s the strength of Bernie Sanders and his platform. speaker 4 He’s a prophet. He knows the way forward.

alexander burns

What you hear there is just the extraordinary stature that Sanders commands on the left. The real fruits of that campaign that he ran in 2015 and 2016, when he got out there into an ideological space that other Democrats were just not comfortable entering and ran an insurgent campaign against the party establishment in a way that most Democrats had really never seen before. So I think you rarely hear candidates referred to us as prophets, but even stopping short of that sort of quasi-religious language, the depth of commitment to Bernie Sanders among his supporters probably exceeds the bond that any other candidate in the race has with their voters.

michael barbaro

Greater even than Trump, or you mean greater even than anyone on the Democratic field?

alexander burns

On the Democratic side, I should say. It is probably closer to Trump than to any of the other Democrats.

michael barbaro

That’s fascinating. But I mean, at the end of the day, a vote is a vote no matter how enthusiastically someone casts it, right? So I wonder what this kind of next-level devotion means for his candidacy.

alexander burns

Well, it has meant that even in what was a very lean summer for him — just a challenging political time where he was being eclipsed by another candidate on the left, Elizabeth Warren — he has never really been at risk of being irrelevant in this race, of being truly sidelined, because right now, it looks like anywhere between 10 percent and 17 or 18 percent of the Democratic Party is very, very tightly bonded to Bernie Sanders.

michael barbaro

One out of five Democrats?

alexander burns

One out of five on a good day. Closer to one out of 10 on a bad day. But still, on his worst day, he’s got more support in the party than every other candidate in the race, except for Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. That’s a pretty good place to be. And his support is different from any other candidate in the race. It is particularly strong among young people. There’s the irony of the Bernie Sanders campaign — the guy who would be the oldest president ever, the oldest candidate in this race, his strongest age group is the youngest age group in the Democratic electorate. What it has also meant is that he has this incredible flow of cash into his campaign, almost irrespective of whatever else is happening in this race. He has a small donor online fundraising machine that has collected tens of millions of dollars for him every quarter that he has been in this race. And in the most recent quarter, he was the number one fundraiser in the Democratic field. That’s an extraordinary thing to say about a candidate who isn’t running a super PAC, isn’t holding conventional big donor events, and is running on Democratic socialism — that he’s the best-funded candidate in the race.

michael barbaro

Right. So his fundraising is outpacing his polling, which, correct me if I’m wrong, is quite unusual in politics.

alexander burns

Right. And you basically only see it when you have these candidates who have a limited but unbelievably passionate base of support.

michael barbaro

So it feels like Bernie Sanders is kind of a test case for why genuine enthusiasm matters so much in politics.

alexander burns

His supporters are willing to do things for him that other candidate’s supporters may not be. He is going to have an easier time staying financially competitive, mobilizing volunteers, and especially in some of these early voting, cold weather states in February, getting them to actually show up and caucus in Iowa in a blizzard, if necessary.

michael barbaro

They’ll do it.

alexander burns

They’ll do it.

michael barbaro

So the next thing that Jess asked voters about at this Sanders rally was this heart attack that Sanders had a couple of weeks ago.

jessica cheung This is its first rally since he just came back from a heart attack. I wonder if you think that that makes him less electable in any way? speaker 1 I don’t think age matters. I think that’s just stupid. Like, I don’t know why people care about that. speaker 2 No, because he came back stronger. And it was a routine procedure that many people go through. speaker 3 I know a lot of people that have had stents put in, and then felt better afterwards than before. And I think he looked great, so I’m going to stick with him. speaker 4 Well, the curious thing is that Bernie, having undergone this procedure, may feel, like, 110 percent better than he did before. Just the amount of literal blood flowing to his heart may give him a level of energy and stamina that he didn’t feel before he underwent the procedure. And he’s — speaker 5 I saw him play softball! speaker 6 I don’t think that our current president has the best health, so why are we worried so much about a heart attack that wasn’t a big deal? He went right back into it afterwards. speaker 7 Both George Bush Sr. and Clinton had the same operation done in their ‘60s, so — jessica cheung He’s also pushing 80, though. speaker 8 He is, but I mean, it doesn’t — I don’t — I’m not thinking about age. I’m thinking about — speaker 9 There’s a pretty heavy bias against Bernie Sanders because he’s a fairly unique candidate. Like, Joe Biden’s eye exploded while we were all watching a debate, and they didn’t single him out with a question like, hey, Joe, like, why did your eye explode? Like, is it going to happen again?

michael barbaro

Did I miss something? Did Joe Biden’s eye suffer some kind of explosion?

alexander burns

There was a CNN town hall where he had some kind of burst capillary in his eye or something like that. It was unsightly, but —

michael barbaro

Something did happen.

alexander burns

— not medically serious, yeah.

michael barbaro

So in summary, it feels like Sanders supporters in this crowd, they are not concerned about this heart attack. And I wonder what you think of the way it was discussed?

alexander burns

I think right after the heart attack happened, there was this moment of questioning, would Sanders persist in this race? Would his support collapse because people suddenly realize he’s almost 80 years old? Would his health become the defining issue of his candidacy? And at least for his supporters, the answer to all those things is no. They are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt on so much, and his physical health is not an exception to that. I think that you hear people giving rationalizations. It’s true that Bill Clinton had a similar operation. It was after he was the president of the United States. But the reality is a candidate having a heart attack is a really big deal. And historically, by any standard of political coverage, it is more than in bounds as a subject for scrutiny and for voters to consider. We’ve never had a president turn 80 in office before. We have two candidates in this race — two of the top three candidates in this race — would turn 80 in their first term as president if they were elected. People remember, I think, pretty well Hillary Clinton fainting at the 9/11 Memorial in the middle of the general election in 2016.

michael barbaro

I think she had pneumonia.

alexander burns

She had pneumonia. And you know, the Clinton campaign, I think, is still quite resentful of the way that was covered, but a candidate collapsing in the middle of a general election is a relevant subject for coverage. President Trump’s lack of transparency about his health has been a huge subject for coverage over the last few years. There’s enormous suspicion about whether we really know everything that we deserve to know about the president’s health. So this is not bias against Bernie Sanders, but the fact that people are inclined to see it as bias against Bernie Sanders, again, underscores the strength of his support.

michael barbaro

So you mentioned Hillary Clinton in 2016. Jessica encountered a lot of supporters who very much wanted to go back to that race and talk about what happened the last time around. And I want to play some of that.

speaker 1 We need to get Bernie elected this time around. The D.N.C. screwed him over in 2016. He was robbed of the nomination. So people want Bernie. speaker 2 I think it’s the race we needed to have in 2016. I think there’s a populist feel going on. The elites are destroying the country. And the Democrats lost because we ran an elitist. And now, it’s time to run a candidate with a multiracial working-class coalition. speaker 3 He knows that the Democrats are just as corrupt as Republicans, because there has been evidence that the D.N.C. did screw with caucuses — that in Seattle, he won by a landslide, but the delegates voted for Hillary anyway.

michael barbaro

So Alex, what do you make of that?

alexander burns

I think there are a lot of myths about the role of the D.N.C. in 2016, but the valid core to all of that is the sense among Sanders supporters — and this is really not up for debate — that the Democratic Party establishment did everything they could to give Hillary Clinton an advantage over him in that primary.

michael barbaro

Remind us of that, just so we can have it in hand.

alexander burns

You had everyone at the top of the party, including President Obama, do what they could to clear the field for Hillary Clinton. You had the leadership of the party in both houses of Congress try to clear the way for Hillary Clinton. You had other kinds of coordination between party officials who were supposed to be neutral, who were ostensibly neutral, and leaders of the Clinton campaign in ways that none of it was illegal and none of it was outside of the American political tradition, but if you’re a Bernie Sanders supporter, and you looked at that, and you felt like there ought to be an even playing field in this race, there wasn’t.

michael barbaro

I wonder how that makes a Bernie Sanders supporter relate to the Democratic Party and to everyone else in the field who identifies as a Democrat, especially if Sanders starts to falter.

alexander burns

This is one of the Trumpiest things about Bernie Sanders and his political movement — that in 2015, 2016, one of the best predictors of support for Donald Trump in the Republican primary was dislike for the Republican Party. He is obviously now come to embody the Republican Party, so that dynamic has changed, but you have a lot of people in the Democratic Party or on the left who are Democratic primary voters supporting Bernie Sanders and do not like the Democratic Party. It’s something that really frustrates more mainline Democrats — that they feel like Bernie is this interloper who is sort of rousing the left against the only party that really speaks to them. But if you are a Bernie Sanders supporter, you look at the traditional Democratic Party establishment as a collection of people and ideas that have failed.

michael barbaro

And what about the candidates?

alexander burns

Well, that is one of the great questions of this race — if Bernie is not the nominee, whether his core supporters will embrace another candidate with similar enthusiasm.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

jessica cheung One of the candidates, Elizabeth Warren, shares very similar policy positions. She’s also a liberal populist. I wonder what makes you continue your support for Bernie over Elizabeth Warren? speaker 1 Warren calls herself a capitalist, and she’s not out for a political revolution. I don’t know if I trust Warren. speaker 2 It’s hard to believe her when she still doesn’t have a Medicare for all policy on her website. speaker 3 It seems like now that she’s kind of just adopting a lot of the things that he was saying his whole life, pretty much. speaker 4 She is taking all of Bernie’s policies and kind of putting a spin on it. And it’s like, do you have any original ideas? And if she believed in these things, why wasn’t she supporting them four years ago? speaker 5 And you know, Warren used to be a Republican. speaker 6 Warren used to be a Republican. speaker 7 She was a Republican, and so, like, Elizabeth Warren, I feel like, is just a watered-down form of Bernie to try to make her more appealing, but the second the primary is over, she’s just going to pivot.

michael barbaro

Well?

alexander burns

Look, that’s really striking. She’s not been a Republican since I was in primary school, which was a while ago. But the fact that Sanders supporters have latched onto that in the way they have, I think, reflects just the gap in trust between how they feel about Bernie and how they feel about almost literally any other politician, certainly any other politician running for president.

michael barbaro

It still feels surprising to hear Sanders supporters attempt to differentiate a Democratic rival who, on paper, is so ideologically similar.

alexander burns

I think there are some important ideological distinctions, at least in the abstract. That I think in Elizabeth Warren’s ideal world, we would be a heavily regulated, heavily enforced, free-market economy — that it would be something similar to an F.D.R., Teddy Roosevelt kind regulatory regime. Bernie Sanders would, I think in his ideal world, have us much closer to a sort of Scandinavian social democracy, which is a really fundamentally different way of approaching government. And part of this is a dynamic that happens in primaries generally — that the candidates who are ideologically closest together can end up having the most sort of intense hostility between their supporters because they feel like only one of these people can emerge from this. And they’re right. But there is I think also a level of seeing the trees, but not the forest here, where you have the number two and number three candidates in this Democratic primary, if they were nominated, would be the most liberal nominee in, certainly, my lifetime and in lifetimes a good deal longer than mine as well. So the level of frustration does seem sort of out of proportion to what the downside of an Elizabeth Warren nomination would be.

michael barbaro

So Alex, to your point about the forest for the trees, Jess asked a lot of these voters, if Sanders doesn’t win, are you fine voting for anybody else in the party who becomes the nominee? And this is what people said.

jessica cheung And who is your second candidate of choice? speaker 1 Elizabeth Warren. speaker 2 If Bernie can’t make it, I’m happy with Elizabeth. speaker 3 If either Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders win the nomination, I would be so happy. And I think it would be, again, a sign of how much the Democratic Party is shifting. speaker 4 I do like Elizabeth Warren’s policies. And like, if Elizabeth Warren is the nominee, I’ll happily vote for her.

michael barbaro

So a lot of them, despite their skepticism of Warren, say, if I had to, I would vote for Elizabeth Warren. But then there were several voters who said that they would be very hard-pressed to turn out for anyone who wasn’t Bernie or what they consider to be kind of Bernie-lite, which is Warren.

speaker Sure, so I like Liz Warren. I think she’s probably the only other candidate I would ever even consider supporting. The rest of them, I find to be rather embarrassing. jessica cheung If it wasn’t Bernie, who’s your second candidate of choice? speaker If it wasn’t, I would probably vote for Elizabeth, if she was the candidate. I wouldn’t vote for Biden.

michael barbaro

That’s really interesting.

alexander burns

It really is. And I guess as they say in the Senate, I should revise and extend what I said about people sort of missing the forest — that you do hear people there sort of recognizing that the party as a whole has moved, that there are candidates besides Bernie, although clearly anyone else would be the second-best choice in this race for them. But I think what you heard is how hard it will be for a candidate who is not an economic populist to speak to this set of voters, that if you end up with a candidate who is an avowed centrist or a nominee who has repudiated what Bernie Sanders stands for — hasn’t just revised or watered down his views, but has rejected them and attacked them — that’s going to be a real challenge in the general election. I think one of the calculations the Democrats have traditionally made — certainly made in 2016 — is that the left will come home at the end of the day. And I think you saw in 2016, that was a risky bet to make.

michael barbaro

Right. I mean, that was a bet that just did not come true, because when Sanders supporters were asked to support Hillary Clinton, many of them did not. In fact, as we know from Times analysis, a meaningful number of them voted for Trump.

alexander burns

In the 2016 primary, it wasn’t just liberals who voted for Sanders in the Democratic primary. There were people who were just sort of disaffected and outside the system, people who wanted a populist, not necessarily somebody who is an ideological liberal as we traditionally think of it, people who just didn’t like Hillary Clinton. And then in the general election, there were people who were Democrats, who just weren’t enthusiastic. They would have turned out to vote for Bernie Sanders, would’ve volunteered for Bernie Sanders, would have donated to Bernie Sanders. And when you start to look at the margins of defeat for Hillary Clinton in the states that made the difference — Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania — could Democratic enthusiasm have turned out an additional 70,000 voters? Very possibly.

michael barbaro

So not to be too prescriptive, but based on everything you’re saying, if Joe Biden is the nominee, it will be a challenge, maybe a significant challenge, for this group of voters to be won over and transferred to him. If it is Elizabeth Warren, that will be more logical, although it will not necessarily be seamless.

alexander burns

I think that’s probably a safe bet. And if you’re Joe Biden, you know, maybe you can bring these people around, maybe you need to make up for a lack of enthusiasm on the left by winning over voters closer to the political middle, even folks on the center-right. That’s clearly a bet that candidates like Joe Biden are making — that if Bernie has his populist following that would be much more enthusiastic about him than about me, well, I have moderates who will never vote for a Democratic socialist, but who I can turn out in a general election. And in a lot of ways, this is the big strategic debate in the Democratic Party right now. We’ve talked a lot about the ideological and policy debates in the party, but sort of fundamental to the Democratic race right now is, are you better off trying to marshal a really enthusiastic and diverse coalition on the left or a more ideologically diverse coalition that is somewhat less reliant on liberal enthusiasm?

[music]

alexander burns

For whoever the nominee is in this election, and I think probably in most elections going forward, just given the ideological and demographic trajectory of the Democratic Party and the country, it’s going to be a recurring challenge for them. How do you harness what Bernie Sanders has created, while also appealing broadly to the voters that you need in order to capture the nomination, because Sanders is not actually doing that right now, and win a general election, which Sanders has never had the chance to try to do? And it’s a particularly important question when you look to the future of the Democratic Party. If you were to sort of make a bet right now about the trajectory of that party over the next few years, it will probably look more and more like the Bernie Sanders base and less and less like the coalition that defeated him in 2016 if the party stays on its current course. This is a group of voters that is very much here to stay. And the question is, do they stay as engaged and enthusiastic Democrats?

michael barbaro

Right, or do they basically start and finish their political journey with Bernie Sanders in a way that doesn’t really help the party?

alexander burns

Do they become passionate lifelong Democratic voters, volunteers, donors, or do they go back to being either casually engaged with politics, or disengaged entirely, or really sort of disgusted with the party as they were in 2016?

michael barbaro

Alex, thank you very much.

Thank you.

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (lindsey graham) O.K., I have introduced a resolution today with Senator McConnell. And the purpose of the resolution is to let the House know that the process you’re engaging in regarding the attempted impeachment of President Trump is a substantial deviation from what the House has done in the past.

michael barbaro

The Republican campaign to challenge the legitimacy of the House impeachment inquiry escalated on Thursday, as Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina introduced a resolution condemning it as unorthodox and improper. Graham focused on the closed-door hearings led by Representative Adam Schiff, despite the fact that Republicans themselves conducted closed-door testimony during the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998. And in his latest effort to break the deadlock over Brexit after yet another major delay, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would seek a new general election in December.

archived recording (boris johnson) We’re being very, very reasonable. We’re saying if you genuinely want more time, you can have it. Here it is. But the condition for that is that we all agree to go for a general election on December the 12th.

michael barbaro

Johnson hopes that such an election would give him a popular mandate to carry out his vision of a swift Brexit, despite deep resistance within Parliament, whose support is needed for such an election. In an interview with the BBC, Johnson defended the strategy, which his opponents in Parliament say is a form of political intimidation designed to scare them into supporting his plan.

archived recording But prime minister, it’s not standard behavior. You’re essentially trying to blackmail Parliament with the threat of an election in order to ram through your bill.

A month later he dismissed criticisms of raising middle class taxes to pay for expanded health care, calling it “a distinction without a difference.”

By October, however, Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., had moved toward the center on all three issues . He has a climate-focused TV ad in which he says, “I believe that we need to have a plan that works for all of us.” The border crossings issue, he told CNN last week, is “the kind of stuff that gets us trapped.” And he’s a month into an attack on Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for not explaining how she’d pay for an overhaul of health care.

For most of his political career, Mr. Buttigieg presented himself as more of a centrist technocrat than a liberal ideologue. But striving for attention in a crowded field, he spent the early part of the 2020 Democratic primary touting an array of aspirational progressive ideas, delivering speeches that could have been ripped from an Aaron Sorkin script.

Now a serious candidate with a policy staff stocked with Washington insiders and a war chest boasting millions from big donors, Mr. Buttigieg has gradually reinvented himself as more of a moderate. While he hasn’t pivoted 180 degrees on policy proposals, he is modulating his positions and drawing explicit and implicit contrasts with his progressive rivals."

Before Sanders, Debs was the most successful socialist candidate in American history, winning hundreds of thousands of votes in the final four of his five campaigns for president. He won 6 percent of the national popular vote in 1912, the equivalent, in 2016 numbers, of more than eight million votes

Debs was best known for his thundering attacks on industrial capitalism. A tireless campaigner, he crisscrossed the country denouncing the inhumane conditions of factory labor and berating the capitalist class for its destructive obsession with profit. “In the wage system you and your children, and your children’s children, if capitalism shall prevail until they are born, are condemned to slavery and there is no possible hope unless by throwing over the capitalists and voting for socialism,” Debs declared in a speech delivered at an Independence Day celebration in Chicago in 1901.

But Debs didn’t just condemn his class enemies. He also called on his audiences to imagine a better world — to realize the democratic and egalitarian promise of the American Revolution through collective action. “We live in the most favored land beneath the unbending sky,” he said in a speech in 1900. “We have all the raw materials and the most marvelous machinery, millions of eager inhabitants seeking employment. Nothing is so easily produced as wealth, and no man should suffer for the need of it.” Debs’s appeal, noted the historian Nick Salvatore in his 1982 biography, “Eugene V. Debs: Citizen and Socialist,” was “frequently described by contemporaries as evangelical, and transcended at that moment factional disagreements and led each in the audience to glimpse a different social order.”

Or, as one self-described “hard-bitten socialist” said to the journalist Heywood Broun at the time: “That old man with the burning eyes actually believes that there can be such a thing as the brotherhood of man. And that’s not the funniest part of it. As long as he’s around, I believe it myself.”"

Paul Krugman is right that a single option version of “Medicare for all” that abolishes existing private health care plans would be politically hazardous. Many of the more than half of the population that is covered by some kind of private health insurance will reflexively not like being told that they will be forced to drop their coverage. Remember how much blowback President Barack Obama received when the media reported that his vow that “ i f you like your health care plan, you can keep it” was not actually true.

Just imagine how many will feel if they are told that they won’t be permitted to keep their health insurance coverage even if they like it. If Senator Elizabeth Warren is indeed so worried about protecting her left flank from Senator Bernie Sanders that she won’t support a less absolutist “public option” plan, then the Democratic Party should choose a different candidate.

Re “Warren Vows to Unveil Single-Payer Specifics” (news article, Oct. 21) and “Favoring Medicare for All, and the Taxes to Pay for It” (news article, Oct. 19):

The media have done a disservice by focusing on raising of taxes to pay for a single-payer health care system rather than focusing on total costs. Currently people pay large sums for health insurance premiums, co-pays, deductibles and prescription drugs. Worse, under the present system, it is estimated that abou t 30 percent of health care costs are for administration, which is double the percentage in Canada.

Under Medicare for all, premiums, co-pays and deductibles would be eliminated. Additionally, the federal government would be able to negotiate drug prices, leading to substantial cost reductions. Taxes will go up, but overall costs to everyone except the very wealthy will go down with a single-payer system. That is, nearly all health care costs will be included in taxes, with minimal other costs for health care."

Chicago is a heavily Democratic city with a long history of backing labor unions. As teachers have marched through downtown and picketed outside schools in recent days, they have often been greeted by supportive car honks and parents offering apple cider and doughnuts. But Ms. Lightfoot and her predecessor, Rahm Emanuel , whose tenure included an especially bitter teachers’ strike in 2012, have struggled to reconcile demands from the union with the bleak finances of the city and the school system.

“Beyond what we put on the table, there is simply no more money,” Ms. Lightfoot said, taking a noticeably harsher tone this week than in the first days of the strike. She added: “Enough is enough. There is no further excuse to keep our kids out of school.”

Ms. Lightfoot suggested that she was unsurprised by Ms. Warren’s arrival, but did not expect it to change much for the city.

“She has her right to come in,” Ms. Lightfoot said. “I would expect all Democratic candidates for the presidency to support workers. That’s who we are as a party. But at the end of the day, what’s going to get it done is what happens at the bargaining table.”

Republicans were also skeptical of the visit.

“Teachers should be wary of any advice Elizabeth Warren may be relaying today in Chicago,” said Kevin Knoth, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee , in a statement that questioned the wisdom of Ms. Warren’s plan for spending billions of dollars more on education.

Alex Burns, we’re going to do something a little bit different here. My colleague, “Daily” producer Jessica Cheung, went to this Bernie Sanders rally over the weekend in Queens, New York. And she recorded everything that she heard.

jessica cheung What’s the sign say? speaker It’s 2016, Bernie. jessica cheung It’s whited out.

And it felt to her and it felt to us that she had really picked the right Bernie Sanders rally to attend, if you’re going to attend just one.

It has been a tough stretch for Bernie Sanders. He had a heart attack.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I am happy to report to you that I am more than ready.

alexander burns

He was off the trail for a couple of weeks ahead of this rally, with the exception of the debate in Ohio. Before the heart attack, the race was showing signs of becoming, really, a two-candidate contest between Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden. And Sanders was really struggling to show that he still had a path to win this thing — not just to be relevant, but to win this thing. And so these forces really converge in Queens.

And he delivers a speech that is in most respects not thematically groundbreaking. It’s about the big ideas of his campaign.

Economic inequality, “Medicare for all,” corruption in Washington and on Wall Street. But he rolls out one of the biggest endorsements a progressive candidate can get, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and delivers his message with a force that is intended to really convey the idea that Bernie is back.

Which is an acknowledgment, of course, that he needs a comeback.

Right, I think he has really resisted the idea that he has fallen behind in this race, but it’s manifestly clear that he has. And from his body language, from his rhetoric, from the way his campaign is now approaching the early states and big events like this one, it’s clear that they know he does need a comeback.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I am more than ready to assume the office of president of the United States. [CHEERING]

michael barbaro

And because his campaign is at this pivotal moment, we wanted to better understand his supporters and the nature of his support. What somebody who shows up at a Bernie Sanders rally thinks about Sanders, how they talk about him, and what that means for the Democratic primary. So that’s what Jessica ended up asking voters about, and so I want to play that for you.

jessica cheung What about him excites you? speaker 1 Bernie is the true progressive — the only true progressive — running in the race. speaker 2 Bernie doesn’t say, leave it to me. Bernie says, come with me. We must join forces to create the fundamental changes required in this society. speaker 3 If you look at Bernie’s record, Bernie has been just saying the same things since pretty much, like, the ‘60s or whenever he came into public office. jessica cheung The ‘80s. speaker 3 Yeah, sorry. jessica cheung It’s OK. speaker 3 The ‘80s, but the country moved around him. And so I think now, there’s a lot of people that are, like, jumping onto the bandwagon, and so I really just think it’s the strength of Bernie Sanders and his platform. speaker 4 He’s a prophet. He knows the way forward.

alexander burns

What you hear there is just the extraordinary stature that Sanders commands on the left. The real fruits of that campaign that he ran in 2015 and 2016, when he got out there into an ideological space that other Democrats were just not comfortable entering and ran an insurgent campaign against the party establishment in a way that most Democrats had really never seen before. So I think you rarely hear candidates referred to us as prophets, but even stopping short of that sort of quasi-religious language, the depth of commitment to Bernie Sanders among his supporters probably exceeds the bond that any other candidate in the race has with their voters.

michael barbaro

Greater even than Trump, or you mean greater even than anyone on the Democratic field?

alexander burns

On the Democratic side, I should say. It is probably closer to Trump than to any of the other Democrats.

michael barbaro

That’s fascinating. But I mean, at the end of the day, a vote is a vote no matter how enthusiastically someone casts it, right? So I wonder what this kind of next-level devotion means for his candidacy.

alexander burns

Well, it has meant that even in what was a very lean summer for him — just a challenging political time where he was being eclipsed by another candidate on the left, Elizabeth Warren — he has never really been at risk of being irrelevant in this race, of being truly sidelined, because right now, it looks like anywhere between 10 percent and 17 or 18 percent of the Democratic Party is very, very tightly bonded to Bernie Sanders.

michael barbaro

One out of five Democrats?

alexander burns

One out of five on a good day. Closer to one out of 10 on a bad day. But still, on his worst day, he’s got more support in the party than every other candidate in the race, except for Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. That’s a pretty good place to be. And his support is different from any other candidate in the race. It is particularly strong among young people. There’s the irony of the Bernie Sanders campaign — the guy who would be the oldest president ever, the oldest candidate in this race, his strongest age group is the youngest age group in the Democratic electorate. What it has also meant is that he has this incredible flow of cash into his campaign, almost irrespective of whatever else is happening in this race. He has a small donor online fundraising machine that has collected tens of millions of dollars for him every quarter that he has been in this race. And in the most recent quarter, he was the number one fundraiser in the Democratic field. That’s an extraordinary thing to say about a candidate who isn’t running a super PAC, isn’t holding conventional big donor events, and is running on Democratic socialism — that he’s the best-funded candidate in the race.

michael barbaro

Right. So his fundraising is outpacing his polling, which, correct me if I’m wrong, is quite unusual in politics.

alexander burns

Right. And you basically only see it when you have these candidates who have a limited but unbelievably passionate base of support.

michael barbaro

So it feels like Bernie Sanders is kind of a test case for why genuine enthusiasm matters so much in politics.

alexander burns

His supporters are willing to do things for him that other candidate’s supporters may not be. He is going to have an easier time staying financially competitive, mobilizing volunteers, and especially in some of these early voting, cold weather states in February, getting them to actually show up and caucus in Iowa in a blizzard, if necessary.

michael barbaro

They’ll do it.

alexander burns

They’ll do it.

michael barbaro

So the next thing that Jess asked voters about at this Sanders rally was this heart attack that Sanders had a couple of weeks ago.

jessica cheung This is its first rally since he just came back from a heart attack. I wonder if you think that that makes him less electable in any way? speaker 1 I don’t think age matters. I think that’s just stupid. Like, I don’t know why people care about that. speaker 2 No, because he came back stronger. And it was a routine procedure that many people go through. speaker 3 I know a lot of people that have had stents put in, and then felt better afterwards than before. And I think he looked great, so I’m going to stick with him. speaker 4 Well, the curious thing is that Bernie, having undergone this procedure, may feel, like, 110 percent better than he did before. Just the amount of literal blood flowing to his heart may give him a level of energy and stamina that he didn’t feel before he underwent the procedure. And he’s — speaker 5 I saw him play softball! speaker 6 I don’t think that our current president has the best health, so why are we worried so much about a heart attack that wasn’t a big deal? He went right back into it afterwards. speaker 7 Both George Bush Sr. and Clinton had the same operation done in their ‘60s, so — jessica cheung He’s also pushing 80, though. speaker 8 He is, but I mean, it doesn’t — I don’t — I’m not thinking about age. I’m thinking about — speaker 9 There’s a pretty heavy bias against Bernie Sanders because he’s a fairly unique candidate. Like, Joe Biden’s eye exploded while we were all watching a debate, and they didn’t single him out with a question like, hey, Joe, like, why did your eye explode? Like, is it going to happen again?

michael barbaro

Did I miss something? Did Joe Biden’s eye suffer some kind of explosion?

alexander burns

There was a CNN town hall where he had some kind of burst capillary in his eye or something like that. It was unsightly, but —

michael barbaro

Something did happen.

alexander burns

— not medically serious, yeah.

michael barbaro

So in summary, it feels like Sanders supporters in this crowd, they are not concerned about this heart attack. And I wonder what you think of the way it was discussed?

alexander burns

I think right after the heart attack happened, there was this moment of questioning, would Sanders persist in this race? Would his support collapse because people suddenly realize he’s almost 80 years old? Would his health become the defining issue of his candidacy? And at least for his supporters, the answer to all those things is no. They are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt on so much, and his physical health is not an exception to that. I think that you hear people giving rationalizations. It’s true that Bill Clinton had a similar operation. It was after he was the president of the United States. But the reality is a candidate having a heart attack is a really big deal. And historically, by any standard of political coverage, it is more than in bounds as a subject for scrutiny and for voters to consider. We’ve never had a president turn 80 in office before. We have two candidates in this race — two of the top three candidates in this race — would turn 80 in their first term as president if they were elected. People remember, I think, pretty well Hillary Clinton fainting at the 9/11 Memorial in the middle of the general election in 2016.

michael barbaro

I think she had pneumonia.

alexander burns

She had pneumonia. And you know, the Clinton campaign, I think, is still quite resentful of the way that was covered, but a candidate collapsing in the middle of a general election is a relevant subject for coverage. President Trump’s lack of transparency about his health has been a huge subject for coverage over the last few years. There’s enormous suspicion about whether we really know everything that we deserve to know about the president’s health. So this is not bias against Bernie Sanders, but the fact that people are inclined to see it as bias against Bernie Sanders, again, underscores the strength of his support.

michael barbaro

So you mentioned Hillary Clinton in 2016. Jessica encountered a lot of supporters who very much wanted to go back to that race and talk about what happened the last time around. And I want to play some of that.

speaker 1 We need to get Bernie elected this time around. The D.N.C. screwed him over in 2016. He was robbed of the nomination. So people want Bernie. speaker 2 I think it’s the race we needed to have in 2016. I think there’s a populist feel going on. The elites are destroying the country. And the Democrats lost because we ran an elitist. And now, it’s time to run a candidate with a multiracial working-class coalition. speaker 3 He knows that the Democrats are just as corrupt as Republicans, because there has been evidence that the D.N.C. did screw with caucuses — that in Seattle, he won by a landslide, but the delegates voted for Hillary anyway.

michael barbaro

So Alex, what do you make of that?

alexander burns

I think there are a lot of myths about the role of the D.N.C. in 2016, but the valid core to all of that is the sense among Sanders supporters — and this is really not up for debate — that the Democratic Party establishment did everything they could to give Hillary Clinton an advantage over him in that primary.

michael barbaro

Remind us of that, just so we can have it in hand.

alexander burns

You had everyone at the top of the party, including President Obama, do what they could to clear the field for Hillary Clinton. You had the leadership of the party in both houses of Congress try to clear the way for Hillary Clinton. You had other kinds of coordination between party officials who were supposed to be neutral, who were ostensibly neutral, and leaders of the Clinton campaign in ways that none of it was illegal and none of it was outside of the American political tradition, but if you’re a Bernie Sanders supporter, and you looked at that, and you felt like there ought to be an even playing field in this race, there wasn’t.

michael barbaro

I wonder how that makes a Bernie Sanders supporter relate to the Democratic Party and to everyone else in the field who identifies as a Democrat, especially if Sanders starts to falter.

alexander burns

This is one of the Trumpiest things about Bernie Sanders and his political movement — that in 2015, 2016, one of the best predictors of support for Donald Trump in the Republican primary was dislike for the Republican Party. He is obviously now come to embody the Republican Party, so that dynamic has changed, but you have a lot of people in the Democratic Party or on the left who are Democratic primary voters supporting Bernie Sanders and do not like the Democratic Party. It’s something that really frustrates more mainline Democrats — that they feel like Bernie is this interloper who is sort of rousing the left against the only party that really speaks to them. But if you are a Bernie Sanders supporter, you look at the traditional Democratic Party establishment as a collection of people and ideas that have failed.

[music]

michael barbaro

And what about the candidates?

alexander burns

Well, that is one of the great questions of this race — if Bernie is not the nominee, whether his core supporters will embrace another candidate with similar enthusiasm.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

jessica cheung One of the candidates, Elizabeth Warren, shares very similar policy positions. She’s also a liberal populist. I wonder what makes you continue your support for Bernie over Elizabeth Warren? speaker 1 Warren calls herself a capitalist, and she’s not out for a political revolution. I don’t know if I trust Warren. speaker 2 It’s hard to believe her when she still doesn’t have a Medicare for all policy on her website. speaker 3 It seems like now that she’s kind of just adopting a lot of the things that he was saying his whole life, pretty much. speaker 4 She is taking all of Bernie’s policies and kind of putting a spin on it. And it’s like, do you have any original ideas? And if she believed in these things, why wasn’t she supporting them four years ago? speaker 5 And you know, Warren used to be a Republican. speaker 6 Warren used to be a Republican. speaker 7 She was a Republican, and so, like, Elizabeth Warren, I feel like, is just a watered-down form of Bernie to try to make her more appealing, but the second the primary is over, she’s just going to pivot.

michael barbaro

Well?

alexander burns

Look, that’s really striking. She’s not been a Republican since I was in primary school, which was a while ago. But the fact that Sanders supporters have latched onto that in the way they have, I think, reflects just the gap in trust between how they feel about Bernie and how they feel about almost literally any other politician, certainly any other politician running for president.

michael barbaro

It still feels surprising to hear Sanders supporters attempt to differentiate a Democratic rival who, on paper, is so ideologically similar.

alexander burns

I think there are some important ideological distinctions, at least in the abstract. That I think in Elizabeth Warren’s ideal world, we would be a heavily regulated, heavily enforced, free-market economy — that it would be something similar to an F.D.R., Teddy Roosevelt kind regulatory regime. Bernie Sanders would, I think in his ideal world, have us much closer to a sort of Scandinavian social democracy, which is a really fundamentally different way of approaching government. And part of this is a dynamic that happens in primaries generally — that the candidates who are ideologically closest together can end up having the most sort of intense hostility between their supporters because they feel like only one of these people can emerge from this. And they’re right. But there is I think also a level of seeing the trees, but not the forest here, where you have the number two and number three candidates in this Democratic primary, if they were nominated, would be the most liberal nominee in, certainly, my lifetime and in lifetimes a good deal longer than mine as well. So the level of frustration does seem sort of out of proportion to what the downside of an Elizabeth Warren nomination would be.

michael barbaro

So Alex, to your point about the forest for the trees, Jess asked a lot of these voters, if Sanders doesn’t win, are you fine voting for anybody else in the party who becomes the nominee? And this is what people said.

jessica cheung And who is your second candidate of choice? speaker 1 Elizabeth Warren. speaker 2 If Bernie can’t make it, I’m happy with Elizabeth. speaker 3 If either Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders win the nomination, I would be so happy. And I think it would be, again, a sign of how much the Democratic Party is shifting. speaker 4 I do like Elizabeth Warren’s policies. And like, if Elizabeth Warren is the nominee, I’ll happily vote for her.

michael barbaro

So a lot of them, despite their skepticism of Warren, say, if I had to, I would vote for Elizabeth Warren. But then there were several voters who said that they would be very hard-pressed to turn out for anyone who wasn’t Bernie or what they consider to be kind of Bernie-lite, which is Warren.

speaker Sure, so I like Liz Warren. I think she’s probably the only other candidate I would ever even consider supporting. The rest of them, I find to be rather embarrassing. jessica cheung If it wasn’t Bernie, who’s your second candidate of choice? speaker If it wasn’t, I would probably vote for Elizabeth, if she was the candidate. I wouldn’t vote for Biden.

michael barbaro

That’s really interesting.

alexander burns

It really is. And I guess as they say in the Senate, I should revise and extend what I said about people sort of missing the forest — that you do hear people there sort of recognizing that the party as a whole has moved, that there are candidates besides Bernie, although clearly anyone else would be the second-best choice in this race for them. But I think what you heard is how hard it will be for a candidate who is not an economic populist to speak to this set of voters, that if you end up with a candidate who is an avowed centrist or a nominee who has repudiated what Bernie Sanders stands for — hasn’t just revised or watered down his views, but has rejected them and attacked them — that’s going to be a real challenge in the general election. I think one of the calculations the Democrats have traditionally made — certainly made in 2016 — is that the left will come home at the end of the day. And I think you saw in 2016, that was a risky bet to make.

michael barbaro

Right. I mean, that was a bet that just did not come true, because when Sanders supporters were asked to support Hillary Clinton, many of them did not. In fact, as we know from Times analysis, a meaningful number of them voted for Trump.

alexander burns

In the 2016 primary, it wasn’t just liberals who voted for Sanders in the Democratic primary. There were people who were just sort of disaffected and outside the system, people who wanted a populist, not necessarily somebody who is an ideological liberal as we traditionally think of it, people who just didn’t like Hillary Clinton. And then in the general election, there were people who were Democrats, who just weren’t enthusiastic. They would have turned out to vote for Bernie Sanders, would’ve volunteered for Bernie Sanders, would have donated to Bernie Sanders. And when you start to look at the margins of defeat for Hillary Clinton in the states that made the difference — Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania — could Democratic enthusiasm have turned out an additional 70,000 voters? Very possibly.

michael barbaro

So not to be too prescriptive, but based on everything you’re saying, if Joe Biden is the nominee, it will be a challenge, maybe a significant challenge, for this group of voters to be won over and transferred to him. If it is Elizabeth Warren, that will be more logical, although it will not necessarily be seamless.

alexander burns

I think that’s probably a safe bet. And if you’re Joe Biden, you know, maybe you can bring these people around, maybe you need to make up for a lack of enthusiasm on the left by winning over voters closer to the political middle, even folks on the center-right. That’s clearly a bet that candidates like Joe Biden are making — that if Bernie has his populist following that would be much more enthusiastic about him than about me, well, I have moderates who will never vote for a Democratic socialist, but who I can turn out in a general election. And in a lot of ways, this is the big strategic debate in the Democratic Party right now. We’ve talked a lot about the ideological and policy debates in the party, but sort of fundamental to the Democratic race right now is, are you better off trying to marshal a really enthusiastic and diverse coalition on the left or a more ideologically diverse coalition that is somewhat less reliant on liberal enthusiasm?

[music]

alexander burns

For whoever the nominee is in this election, and I think probably in most elections going forward, just given the ideological and demographic trajectory of the Democratic Party and the country, it’s going to be a recurring challenge for them. How do you harness what Bernie Sanders has created, while also appealing broadly to the voters that you need in order to capture the nomination, because Sanders is not actually doing that right now, and win a general election, which Sanders has never had the chance to try to do? And it’s a particularly important question when you look to the future of the Democratic Party. If you were to sort of make a bet right now about the trajectory of that party over the next few years, it will probably look more and more like the Bernie Sanders base and less and less like the coalition that defeated him in 2016 if the party stays on its current course. This is a group of voters that is very much here to stay. And the question is, do they stay as engaged and enthusiastic Democrats?

michael barbaro

Right, or do they basically start and finish their political journey with Bernie Sanders in a way that doesn’t really help the party?

alexander burns

Do they become passionate lifelong Democratic voters, volunteers, donors, or do they go back to being either casually engaged with politics, or disengaged entirely, or really sort of disgusted with the party as they were in 2016?

michael barbaro

Alex, thank you very much.

alexander burns

Thank you.

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (lindsey graham) O.K., I have introduced a resolution today with Senator McConnell. And the purpose of the resolution is to let the House know that the process you’re engaging in regarding the attempted impeachment of President Trump is a substantial deviation from what the House has done in the past.

michael barbaro

The Republican campaign to challenge the legitimacy of the House impeachment inquiry escalated on Thursday, as Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina introduced a resolution condemning it as unorthodox and improper. Graham focused on the closed-door hearings led by Representative Adam Schiff, despite the fact that Republicans themselves conducted closed-door testimony during the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998. And in his latest effort to break the deadlock over Brexit after yet another major delay, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would seek a new general election in December.

archived recording (boris johnson) We’re being very, very reasonable. We’re saying if you genuinely want more time, you can have it. Here it is. But the condition for that is that we all agree to go for a general election on December the 12th.

michael barbaro

Johnson hopes that such an election would give him a popular mandate to carry out his vision of a swift Brexit, despite deep resistance within Parliament, whose support is needed for such an election. In an interview with the BBC, Johnson defended the strategy, which his opponents in Parliament say is a form of political intimidation designed to scare them into supporting his plan.

archived recording But prime minister, it’s not standard behavior. You’re essentially trying to blackmail Parliament with the threat of an election in order to ram through your bill. You could just say, fine, let’s have as long as it takes to get through this line by line in Parliament. Would that not be the responsible thing to do? archived recording (boris johnson) Now, come on. We’ve had three and a half years of this. archived recording Not looking at this bill.

But give Trump this: He’s turning a remarkable number of foreign policy liberals and progressives into born-again neoconservatives.

That’s a thought worth pondering as the president pursues a foreign policy that, had it been undertaken by a Democratic administration, would likely have been met with considerable approval on the left. After all, getting America out of fill-in-the-blank — Vietnam, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Iraq, Afghanistan — has for decades been the go-to slogan of progressives.

Why, now, should our retreat from Syria be any different?

If the argument is that the Kurds stood by us, depended on us, and helped us to wage a difficult war, well, so did many others, such as the Montagnards in Vietnam. If the argument is that our retreat from Syria creates the conditions for a humanitarian disaster, one must ask: Where was that humanitarian concern when much of the left was agitating for immediate U.S. withdrawal from Iraq as terrorist and sectarian violence exploded in 2005 and 2006? If the argument is that we are sending a fatal signal of fecklessness to friend and foe alike, why were so many liberals prepared to give Barack Obama a pass when the al-Assad regime violated his chemical red line in 2013?"

By October, however, Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., had moved toward the center on all three issues . He has a climate-focused TV ad in which he says, “I believe that we need to have a plan that works for all of us.” The border crossings issue, he told CNN last week, is “the kind of stuff that gets us trapped.” And he’s a month into an attack on Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for not explaining how she’d pay for an overhaul of health care.

For most of his political career, Mr. Buttigieg presented himself as more of a centrist technocrat than a liberal ideologue. But striving for attention in a crowded field, he spent the early part of the 2020 Democratic primary touting an array of aspirational progressive ideas, delivering speeches that could have been ripped from an Aaron Sorkin script.

Now a serious candidate with a policy staff stocked with Washington insiders and a war chest boasting millions from big donors, Mr. Buttigieg has gradually reinvented himself as more of a moderate.

Paul Krugman is right that a single option version of “Medicare for all” that abolishes existing private health care plans would be politically hazardous. Many of the more than half of the population that is covered by some kind of private health insurance will reflexively not like being told that they will be forced to drop their coverage. Remember how much blowback President Barack Obama received when the media reported that his vow that “ i f you like your health care plan, you can keep it” was not actually true.

Just imagine how many will feel if they are told that they won’t be permitted to keep their health insurance coverage even if they like it. If Senator Elizabeth Warren is indeed so worried about protecting her left flank from Senator Bernie Sanders that she won’t support a less absolutist “public option” plan, then the Democratic Party should choose a different candidate.

Re “Warren Vows to Unveil Single-Payer Specifics” (news article, Oct. 21) and “Favoring Medicare for All, and the Taxes to Pay for It” (news article, Oct. 19):

The media have done a disservice by focusing on raising of taxes to pay for a single-payer health care system rather than focusing on total costs. Currently people pay large sums for health insurance premiums, co-pays, deductibles and prescription drugs. Worse, under the present system, it is estimated that abou t 30 percent of health care costs are for administration, which is double the percentage in Canada.

Under Medicare for all, premiums, co-pays and deductibles would be eliminated. Additionally, the federal government would be able to negotiate drug prices, leading to substantial cost reductions. Taxes will go up, but overall costs to everyone except the very wealthy will go down with a single-payer system. That is, nearly all health care costs will be included in taxes, with minimal other costs for health care."

michael barbaro

Alex Burns, we’re going to do something a little bit different here. My colleague, “Daily” producer Jessica Cheung, went to this Bernie Sanders rally over the weekend in Queens, New York. And she recorded everything that she heard.

jessica cheung What’s the sign say? speaker It’s 2016, Bernie. jessica cheung It’s whited out.

michael barbaro

And it felt to her and it felt to us that she had really picked the right Bernie Sanders rally to attend, if you’re going to attend just one.

alexander burns

She really did. This came at a huge moment for the Sanders campaign. It was a huge test for the Sanders campaign.

archived recording (bernie sanders) We got a permit for 20,000 people, and we had to close the doors.

alexander burns

It has been a tough stretch for Bernie Sanders. He had a heart attack.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I am happy to report to you that I am more than ready.

alexander burns

He was off the trail for a couple of weeks ahead of this rally, with the exception of the debate in Ohio. Before the heart attack, the race was showing signs of becoming, really, a two-candidate contest between Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden. And Sanders was really struggling to show that he still had a path to win this thing — not just to be relevant, but to win this thing. And so these forces really converge in Queens.

And he delivers a speech that is in most respects not thematically groundbreaking. It’s about the big ideas of his campaign.

Economic inequality, “Medicare for all,” corruption in Washington and on Wall Street.

Which is an acknowledgment, of course, that he needs a comeback.

alexander burns

Right, I think he has really resisted the idea that he has fallen behind in this race, but it’s manifestly clear that he has. And from his body language, from his rhetoric, from the way his campaign is now approaching the early states and big events like this one, it’s clear that they know he does need a comeback.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I am more than ready to assume the office of president of the United States. [CHEERING]

michael barbaro

And because his campaign is at this pivotal moment, we wanted to better understand his supporters and the nature of his support. What somebody who shows up at a Bernie Sanders rally thinks about Sanders, how they talk about him, and what that means for the Democratic primary. So that’s what Jessica ended up asking voters about, and so I want to play that for you.

jessica cheung What about him excites you? speaker 1 Bernie is the true progressive — the only true progressive — running in the race. speaker 2 Bernie doesn’t say, leave it to me. Bernie says, come with me. We must join forces to create the fundamental changes required in this society. speaker 3 If you look at Bernie’s record, Bernie has been just saying the same things since pretty much, like, the ‘60s or whenever he came into public office. jessica cheung The ‘80s. speaker 3 Yeah, sorry. jessica cheung It’s OK. speaker 3 The ‘80s, but the country moved around him. And so I think now, there’s a lot of people that are, like, jumping onto the bandwagon, and so I really just think it’s the strength of Bernie Sanders and his platform. speaker 4 He’s a prophet. He knows the way forward.

alexander burns

What you hear there is just the extraordinary stature that Sanders commands on the left. The real fruits of that campaign that he ran in 2015 and 2016, when he got out there into an ideological space that other Democrats were just not comfortable entering and ran an insurgent campaign against the party establishment in a way that most Democrats had really never seen before. So I think you rarely hear candidates referred to us as prophets, but even stopping short of that sort of quasi-religious language, the depth of commitment to Bernie Sanders among his supporters probably exceeds the bond that any other candidate in the race has with their voters.

michael barbaro

Greater even than Trump, or you mean greater even than anyone on the Democratic field?

On the Democratic side, I should say. It is probably closer to Trump than to any of the other Democrats.

michael barbaro

That’s fascinating. But I mean, at the end of the day, a vote is a vote no matter how enthusiastically someone casts it, right? So I wonder what this kind of next-level devotion means for his candidacy.

alexander burns

Well, it has meant that even in what was a very lean summer for him — just a challenging political time where he was being eclipsed by another candidate on the left, Elizabeth Warren — he has never really been at risk of being irrelevant in this race, of being truly sidelined, because right now, it looks like anywhere between 10 percent and 17 or 18 percent of the Democratic Party is very, very tightly bonded to Bernie Sanders.

michael barbaro

One out of five Democrats?

alexander burns

One out of five on a good day. Closer to one out of 10 on a bad day. But still, on his worst day, he’s got more support in the party than every other candidate in the race, except for Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. That’s a pretty good place to be. And his support is different from any other candidate in the race. It is particularly strong among young people. There’s the irony of the Bernie Sanders campaign — the guy who would be the oldest president ever, the oldest candidate in this race, his strongest age group is the youngest age group in the Democratic electorate. What it has also meant is that he has this incredible flow of cash into his campaign, almost irrespective of whatever else is happening in this race. He has a small donor online fundraising machine that has collected tens of millions of dollars for him every quarter that he has been in this race. And in the most recent quarter, he was the number one fundraiser in the Democratic field. That’s an extraordinary thing to say about a candidate who isn’t running a super PAC, isn’t holding conventional big donor events, and is running on Democratic socialism — that he’s the best-funded candidate in the race.

michael barbaro

Right. So his fundraising is outpacing his polling, which, correct me if I’m wrong, is quite unusual in politics.

alexander burns

Right. And you basically only see it when you have these candidates who have a limited but unbelievably passionate base of support.

michael barbaro

So it feels like Bernie Sanders is kind of a test case for why genuine enthusiasm matters so much in politics.

alexander burns

His supporters are willing to do things for him that other candidate’s supporters may not be. He is going to have an easier time staying financially competitive, mobilizing volunteers, and especially in some of these early voting, cold weather states in February, getting them to actually show up and caucus in Iowa in a blizzard, if necessary.

michael barbaro

They’ll do it.

alexander burns

They’ll do it.

michael barbaro

So the next thing that Jess asked voters about at this Sanders rally was this heart attack that Sanders had a couple of weeks ago.

jessica cheung This is its first rally since he just came back from a heart attack. I wonder if you think that that makes him less electable in any way? speaker 1 I don’t think age matters. I think that’s just stupid. Like, I don’t know why people care about that. speaker 2 No, because he came back stronger. And it was a routine procedure that many people go through. speaker 3 I know a lot of people that have had stents put in, and then felt better afterwards than before. And I think he looked great, so I’m going to stick with him. speaker 4 Well, the curious thing is that Bernie, having undergone this procedure, may feel, like, 110 percent better than he did before. Just the amount of literal blood flowing to his heart may give him a level of energy and stamina that he didn’t feel before he underwent the procedure. And he’s — speaker 5 I saw him play softball! speaker 6 I don’t think that our current president has the best health, so why are we worried so much about a heart attack that wasn’t a big deal? He went right back into it afterwards. speaker 7 Both George Bush Sr. and Clinton had the same operation done in their ‘60s, so — jessica cheung He’s also pushing 80, though. speaker 8 He is, but I mean, it doesn’t — I don’t — I’m not thinking about age. I’m thinking about — speaker 9 There’s a pretty heavy bias against Bernie Sanders because he’s a fairly unique candidate. Like, Joe Biden’s eye exploded while we were all watching a debate, and they didn’t single him out with a question like, hey, Joe, like, why did your eye explode? Like, is it going to happen again?

michael barbaro

Did I miss something? Did Joe Biden’s eye suffer some kind of explosion?

alexander burns

There was a CNN town hall where he had some kind of burst capillary in his eye or something like that. It was unsightly, but —

michael barbaro

Something did happen.

alexander burns

— not medically serious, yeah.

michael barbaro

So in summary, it feels like Sanders supporters in this crowd, they are not concerned about this heart attack. And I wonder what you think of the way it was discussed?

alexander burns

I think right after the heart attack happened, there was this moment of questioning, would Sanders persist in this race? Would his support collapse because people suddenly realize he’s almost 80 years old? Would his health become the defining issue of his candidacy? And at least for his supporters, the answer to all those things is no. They are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt on so much, and his physical health is not an exception to that. I think that you hear people giving rationalizations. It’s true that Bill Clinton had a similar operation. It was after he was the president of the United States. But the reality is a candidate having a heart attack is a really big deal. And historically, by any standard of political coverage, it is more than in bounds as a subject for scrutiny and for voters to consider. We’ve never had a president turn 80 in office before. We have two candidates in this race — two of the top three candidates in this race — would turn 80 in their first term as president if they were elected. People remember, I think, pretty well Hillary Clinton fainting at the 9/11 Memorial in the middle of the general election in 2016.

michael barbaro

I think she had pneumonia.

alexander burns

She had pneumonia. And you know, the Clinton campaign, I think, is still quite resentful of the way that was covered, but a candidate collapsing in the middle of a general election is a relevant subject for coverage. President Trump’s lack of transparency about his health has been a huge subject for coverage over the last few years. There’s enormous suspicion about whether we really know everything that we deserve to know about the president’s health. So this is not bias against Bernie Sanders, but the fact that people are inclined to see it as bias against Bernie Sanders, again, underscores the strength of his support.

michael barbaro

So you mentioned Hillary Clinton in 2016. Jessica encountered a lot of supporters who very much wanted to go back to that race and talk about what happened the last time around. And I want to play some of that.

speaker 1 We need to get Bernie elected this time around. The D.N.C. screwed him over in 2016. He was robbed of the nomination. So people want Bernie. speaker 2 I think it’s the race we needed to have in 2016. I think there’s a populist feel going on. The elites are destroying the country. And the Democrats lost because we ran an elitist. And now, it’s time to run a candidate with a multiracial working-class coalition. speaker 3 He knows that the Democrats are just as corrupt as Republicans, because there has been evidence that the D.N.C. did screw with caucuses — that in Seattle, he won by a landslide, but the delegates voted for Hillary anyway.

michael barbaro

So Alex, what do you make of that?

alexander burns

I think there are a lot of myths about the role of the D.N.C. in 2016, but the valid core to all of that is the sense among Sanders supporters — and this is really not up for debate — that the Democratic Party establishment did everything they could to give Hillary Clinton an advantage over him in that primary.

michael barbaro

Remind us of that, just so we can have it in hand.

alexander burns

You had everyone at the top of the party, including President Obama, do what they could to clear the field for Hillary Clinton. You had the leadership of the party in both houses of Congress try to clear the way for Hillary Clinton. You had other kinds of coordination between party officials who were supposed to be neutral, who were ostensibly neutral, and leaders of the Clinton campaign in ways that none of it was illegal and none of it was outside of the American political tradition, but if you’re a Bernie Sanders supporter, and you looked at that, and you felt like there ought to be an even playing field in this race, there wasn’t.

michael barbaro

I wonder how that makes a Bernie Sanders supporter relate to the Democratic Party and to everyone else in the field who identifies as a Democrat, especially if Sanders starts to falter.

alexander burns

This is one of the Trumpiest things about Bernie Sanders and his political movement — that in 2015, 2016, one of the best predictors of support for Donald Trump in the Republican primary was dislike for the Republican Party. He is obviously now come to embody the Republican Party, so that dynamic has changed, but you have a lot of people in the Democratic Party or on the left who are Democratic primary voters supporting Bernie Sanders and do not like the Democratic Party. It’s something that really frustrates more mainline Democrats — that they feel like Bernie is this interloper who is sort of rousing the left against the only party that really speaks to them. But if you are a Bernie Sanders supporter, you look at the traditional Democratic Party establishment as a collection of people and ideas that have failed.

[music]

michael barbaro

And what about the candidates?

alexander burns

Well, that is one of the great questions of this race — if Bernie is not the nominee, whether his core supporters will embrace another candidate with similar enthusiasm.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

jessica cheung One of the candidates, Elizabeth Warren, shares very similar policy positions. She’s also a liberal populist. I wonder what makes you continue your support for Bernie over Elizabeth Warren? speaker 1 Warren calls herself a capitalist, and she’s not out for a political revolution. I don’t know if I trust Warren. speaker 2 It’s hard to believe her when she still doesn’t have a Medicare for all policy on her website. speaker 3 It seems like now that she’s kind of just adopting a lot of the things that he was saying his whole life, pretty much. speaker 4 She is taking all of Bernie’s policies and kind of putting a spin on it. And it’s like, do you have any original ideas? And if she believed in these things, why wasn’t she supporting them four years ago? speaker 5 And you know, Warren used to be a Republican. speaker 6 Warren used to be a Republican. speaker 7 She was a Republican, and so, like, Elizabeth Warren, I feel like, is just a watered-down form of Bernie to try to make her more appealing, but the second the primary is over, she’s just going to pivot.

michael barbaro

Well?

alexander burns

Look, that’s really striking. She’s not been a Republican since I was in primary school, which was a while ago. But the fact that Sanders supporters have latched onto that in the way they have, I think, reflects just the gap in trust between how they feel about Bernie and how they feel about almost literally any other politician, certainly any other politician running for president.

michael barbaro

It still feels surprising to hear Sanders supporters attempt to differentiate a Democratic rival who, on paper, is so ideologically similar.

alexander burns

I think there are some important ideological distinctions, at least in the abstract. That I think in Elizabeth Warren’s ideal world, we would be a heavily regulated, heavily enforced, free-market economy — that it would be something similar to an F.D.R., Teddy Roosevelt kind regulatory regime. Bernie Sanders would, I think in his ideal world, have us much closer to a sort of Scandinavian social democracy, which is a really fundamentally different way of approaching government. And part of this is a dynamic that happens in primaries generally — that the candidates who are ideologically closest together can end up having the most sort of intense hostility between their supporters because they feel like only one of these people can emerge from this. And they’re right. But there is I think also a level of seeing the trees, but not the forest here, where you have the number two and number three candidates in this Democratic primary, if they were nominated, would be the most liberal nominee in, certainly, my lifetime and in lifetimes a good deal longer than mine as well. So the level of frustration does seem sort of out of proportion to what the downside of an Elizabeth Warren nomination would be.

michael barbaro

So Alex, to your point about the forest for the trees, Jess asked a lot of these voters, if Sanders doesn’t win, are you fine voting for anybody else in the party who becomes the nominee? And this is what people said.

jessica cheung And who is your second candidate of choice? speaker 1 Elizabeth Warren. speaker 2 If Bernie can’t make it, I’m happy with Elizabeth. speaker 3 If either Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders win the nomination, I would be so happy. And I think it would be, again, a sign of how much the Democratic Party is shifting. speaker 4 I do like Elizabeth Warren’s policies. And like, if Elizabeth Warren is the nominee, I’ll happily vote for her.

michael barbaro

So a lot of them, despite their skepticism of Warren, say, if I had to, I would vote for Elizabeth Warren. But then there were several voters who said that they would be very hard-pressed to turn out for anyone who wasn’t Bernie or what they consider to be kind of Bernie-lite, which is Warren.

speaker Sure, so I like Liz Warren. I think she’s probably the only other candidate I would ever even consider supporting. The rest of them, I find to be rather embarrassing. jessica cheung If it wasn’t Bernie, who’s your second candidate of choice? speaker If it wasn’t, I would probably vote for Elizabeth, if she was the candidate. I wouldn’t vote for Biden.

michael barbaro

That’s really interesting.

alexander burns

It really is. And I guess as they say in the Senate, I should revise and extend what I said about people sort of missing the forest — that you do hear people there sort of recognizing that the party as a whole has moved, that there are candidates besides Bernie, although clearly anyone else would be the second-best choice in this race for them. But I think what you heard is how hard it will be for a candidate who is not an economic populist to speak to this set of voters, that if you end up with a candidate who is an avowed centrist or a nominee who has repudiated what Bernie Sanders stands for — hasn’t just revised or watered down his views, but has rejected them and attacked them — that’s going to be a real challenge in the general election. I think one of the calculations the Democrats have traditionally made — certainly made in 2016 — is that the left will come home at the end of the day. And I think you saw in 2016, that was a risky bet to make.

michael barbaro

Right. I mean, that was a bet that just did not come true, because when Sanders supporters were asked to support Hillary Clinton, many of them did not. In fact, as we know from Times analysis, a meaningful number of them voted for Trump.

alexander burns

In the 2016 primary, it wasn’t just liberals who voted for Sanders in the Democratic primary. There were people who were just sort of disaffected and outside the system, people who wanted a populist, not necessarily somebody who is an ideological liberal as we traditionally think of it, people who just didn’t like Hillary Clinton. And then in the general election, there were people who were Democrats, who just weren’t enthusiastic. They would have turned out to vote for Bernie Sanders, would’ve volunteered for Bernie Sanders, would have donated to Bernie Sanders. And when you start to look at the margins of defeat for Hillary Clinton in the states that made the difference — Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania — could Democratic enthusiasm have turned out an additional 70,000 voters? Very possibly.

michael barbaro

So not to be too prescriptive, but based on everything you’re saying, if Joe Biden is the nominee, it will be a challenge, maybe a significant challenge, for this group of voters to be won over and transferred to him. If it is Elizabeth Warren, that will be more logical, although it will not necessarily be seamless.

alexander burns

I think that’s probably a safe bet. And if you’re Joe Biden, you know, maybe you can bring these people around, maybe you need to make up for a lack of enthusiasm on the left by winning over voters closer to the political middle, even folks on the center-right. That’s clearly a bet that candidates like Joe Biden are making — that if Bernie has his populist following that would be much more enthusiastic about him than about me, well, I have moderates who will never vote for a Democratic socialist, but who I can turn out in a general election. And in a lot of ways, this is the big strategic debate in the Democratic Party right now. We’ve talked a lot about the ideological and policy debates in the party, but sort of fundamental to the Democratic race right now is, are you better off trying to marshal a really enthusiastic and diverse coalition on the left or a more ideologically diverse coalition that is somewhat less reliant on liberal enthusiasm?

[music]

alexander burns

For whoever the nominee is in this election, and I think probably in most elections going forward, just given the ideological and demographic trajectory of the Democratic Party and the country, it’s going to be a recurring challenge for them. How do you harness what Bernie Sanders has created, while also appealing broadly to the voters that you need in order to capture the nomination, because Sanders is not actually doing that right now, and win a general election, which Sanders has never had the chance to try to do? And it’s a particularly important question when you look to the future of the Democratic Party. If you were to sort of make a bet right now about the trajectory of that party over the next few years, it will probably look more and more like the Bernie Sanders base and less and less like the coalition that defeated him in 2016 if the party stays on its current course. This is a group of voters that is very much here to stay. And the question is, do they stay as engaged and enthusiastic Democrats?

michael barbaro

Right, or do they basically start and finish their political journey with Bernie Sanders in a way that doesn’t really help the party?

alexander burns

Do they become passionate lifelong Democratic voters, volunteers, donors, or do they go back to being either casually engaged with politics, or disengaged entirely, or really sort of disgusted with the party as they were in 2016?

michael barbaro

Alex, thank you very much.

alexander burns

Thank you.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (lindsey graham) O.K., I have introduced a resolution today with Senator McConnell. And the purpose of the resolution is to let the House know that the process you’re engaging in regarding the attempted impeachment of President Trump is a substantial deviation from what the House has done in the past.

michael barbaro

The Republican campaign to challenge the legitimacy of the House impeachment inquiry escalated on Thursday, as Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina introduced a resolution condemning it as unorthodox and improper. Graham focused on the closed-door hearings led by Representative Adam Schiff, despite the fact that Republicans themselves conducted closed-door testimony during the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998. And in his latest effort to break the deadlock over Brexit after yet another major delay, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would seek a new general election in December.

archived recording (boris johnson) We’re being very, very reasonable. We’re saying if you genuinely want more time, you can have it. Here it is. But the condition for that is that we all agree to go for a general election on December the 12th.

michael barbaro

Johnson hopes that such an election would give him a popular mandate to carry out his vision of a swift Brexit, despite deep resistance within Parliament, whose support is needed for such an election. In an interview with the BBC, Johnson defended the strategy, which his opponents in Parliament say is a form of political intimidation designed to scare them into supporting his plan.

archived recording But prime minister, it’s not standard behavior. You’re essentially trying to blackmail Parliament with the threat of an election in order to ram through your bill. You could just say, fine, let’s have as long as it takes to get through this line by line in Parliament. Would that not be the responsible thing to do? archived recording (boris johnson) Now, come on. We’ve had three and a half years of this. archived recording Not looking at this bill.

But for Mr. Sanders, the political pressure and personal stakes are unique.",2019-10-25,The New York Times,Bernie Sanders Almost Won Iowa in 2016. He Knows He Can’t Slip Now.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/us/politics/bernie-sanders-iowa.html,"The sudden flurry of attention represents a change from earlier this year, when White House hopefuls appeared to be embracing a more national campaign strategy that took them beyond Iowa and other early nominating states. The growth of social media, the changes to the electoral calendar and the increasing diversity of the Democratic electorate combined to make it seem like Iowa, a predominantly white state, might lose its sway in the primary process.

“Usually there’s a ramp-up period in past presidential cycles,” said Sean Bagniewski, the Democratic chair in Polk County, about the focus on Iowa. “This year, it was like a thunderclap.”

The stakes in Iowa for Mr. Sanders have personal and psychological dimensions. After his surprising performance in the caucuses in 2016, some aides said the state has taken on an almost mystical quality. A weak result could also indicate that he does not have the same influence with progressive voters as he used to.

Despite a series of disappointing polls in the state — a Suffolk University/USA Today poll released this week showed him in fourth place — allies are confident he is still in a position to do well.

Like it did in 2016, the Sanders campaign is betting on an extensive ground game that relies heavily on a vast network of volunteers that they hope will motivate other supporters to turn out on caucus night — including people who do not typically participate in the political process.

His aides believe that the technique, known as distributed organizing, will help motivate unlikely or first-time caucusgoers, especially those who were too young to participate in the last presidential caucuses; Latino voters, whose turnout rate in the caucuses is typically low; and working-class voters. The campaign sees high potential for victory particularly in and around college towns, like Ames and Iowa City, and in rural areas.

To solidify his base of support, he has spent hours rallying on college campuses in an effort to capture the support of young voters. He has courted labor support particularly in counties along the Mississippi River. And he has held multiple “Unidos con Bernie” events with Latino voters."

But give Trump this: He’s turning a remarkable number of foreign policy liberals and progressives into born-again neoconservatives.

That’s a thought worth pondering as the president pursues a foreign policy that, had it been undertaken by a Democratic administration, would likely have been met with considerable approval on the left. After all, getting America out of fill-in-the-blank — Vietnam, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Iraq, Afghanistan — has for decades been the go-to slogan of progressives.

Why, now, should our retreat from Syria be any different?

If the argument is that the Kurds stood by us, depended on us, and helped us to wage a difficult war, well, so did many others, such as the Montagnards in Vietnam. If the argument is that our retreat from Syria creates the conditions for a humanitarian disaster, one must ask: Where was that humanitarian concern when much of the left was agitating for immediate U.S. withdrawal from Iraq as terrorist and sectarian violence exploded in 2005 and 2006? If the argument is that we are sending a fatal signal of fecklessness to friend and foe alike, why were so many liberals prepared to give Barack Obama a pass when the al-Assad regime violated his chemical red line in 2013?"

But that’s not ridicule, you say? Well, that’s the point: Who should be trusted to decide such things when fines, jail time and expulsion from college loom as possible consequences?

Second, federal courts consistently have struck down speech codes at public universities that punished students who engaged in undefined “acts of intolerance” or who “stigmatized” others based on their race, religion, sexuality or other characteristic. One such decision invalidated a university speech code that imposed discipline for “threats, insults, epithets, ridicule or personal attacks.”

The reasoning in those cases — that speech may not be censored or punished for its content — also applies in the University of Connecticut case. Here, there was not even an identifiable target of the offensive speech, just a bystander with a cellphone. (Moreover, it appears that the Connecticut law, which was enacted a century ago, was intended to apply only to some form of “advertisement,” making the use of the law to criminalize the students’ speech even more misguided.)

To be sure, speech may be punished when the words used are likely to produce what the Supreme Court has called “imminent lawless action,” such as physical violence. But this leads to the third reason Connecticut’s anti-ridicule statute is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court case that established that rule, Brandenburg v. Ohio in 1969, involved the prosecution of Ku Klux Klansmen who were filmed uttering repulsive racist statements — including the N-word. But as in the case of the University of Connecticut students, the Klansmen’s words provoked no action, and the Ohio law under which the men were prosecuted was struck down under the First Amendment.

In the face of an absurd statute like Connecticut’s anti-ridicule law, it is tempting to extol the value of satire, irreverence and cheek as part of our country’s robust free-speech traditions. But this is not the time for that. Racial, ethnic, sexual and religious slurs exact a social cost. They deprive members of the affected groups of their dignity and inhibit their participation in our democracy as equal citizens.

But it is possible to hold that thought in mind while keeping in mind another thought: that we do not want the police or prosecutors — or university administrators, who too often cave in to public pressure in such situations — wielding the power to decide what constitutes “ridicule” and when someone should be hauled up on charges for engaging in it.

Bernie Sanders drew the largest crowd of his campaign yet at a rally in New York City last weekend, at a moment when his candidacy may be at its most vulnerable.

Those crowds are raising a fraught question for the leaders of the Democratic Party. Is the loyalty of Sanders’s supporters to the party or just to him?

jessica cheung Hi, I’m a producer at The New York Times, “The Daily.” Can I ask you guys a few questions? speaker 1 Totally. speaker 2 Yeah, totally. jessica cheung What brought you out here today? speaker 1 We love Bernie. speaker 2 I’m a huge Bernie fan. speaker 3 I’ve always supported Bernie, even before I could vote, so —

michael barbaro

Alex Burns, we’re going to do something a little bit different here. My colleague, “Daily” producer Jessica Cheung, went to this Bernie Sanders rally over the weekend in Queens, New York. And she recorded everything that she heard.

jessica cheung What’s the sign say? speaker It’s 2016, Bernie. jessica cheung It’s whited out.

michael barbaro

And it felt to her and it felt to us that she had really picked the right Bernie Sanders rally to attend, if you’re going to attend just one.

alexander burns

She really did. This came at a huge moment for the Sanders campaign. It was a huge test for the Sanders campaign.

archived recording (bernie sanders) We got a permit for 20,000 people, and we had to close the doors.

alexander burns

It has been a tough stretch for Bernie Sanders. He had a heart attack.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I am happy to report to you that I am more than ready.

alexander burns

He was off the trail for a couple of weeks ahead of this rally, with the exception of the debate in Ohio. Before the heart attack, the race was showing signs of becoming, really, a two-candidate contest between Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden. And Sanders was really struggling to show that he still had a path to win this thing — not just to be relevant, but to win this thing. And so these forces really converge in Queens.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Are you willing to fight for that person who you don’t even know as much as you’re willing to fight for yourself? [CHEERING]

alexander burns

And he delivers a speech that is in most respects not thematically groundbreaking. It’s about the big ideas of his campaign.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Today in America, half of our population is living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to pay their rents, their mortgages, their light bill, or fix their car.

alexander burns

Economic inequality, “Medicare for all,” corruption in Washington and on Wall Street. But he rolls out one of the biggest endorsements a progressive candidate can get, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and delivers his message with a force that is intended to really convey the idea that Bernie is back.

michael barbaro

In fact, I think he says —

archived recording (bernie sanders) To put it bluntly, I am back.

michael barbaro

— I’m back.

archived recording (CHANTING) Bernie’s back. Bernie’s back. Bernie’s back. Bernie’s back.

michael barbaro

Which is an acknowledgment, of course, that he needs a comeback.

alexander burns

Right, I think he has really resisted the idea that he has fallen behind in this race, but it’s manifestly clear that he has. And from his body language, from his rhetoric, from the way his campaign is now approaching the early states and big events like this one, it’s clear that they know he does need a comeback.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I am more than ready to assume the office of president of the United States. [CHEERING]

michael barbaro

And because his campaign is at this pivotal moment, we wanted to better understand his supporters and the nature of his support. What somebody who shows up at a Bernie Sanders rally thinks about Sanders, how they talk about him, and what that means for the Democratic primary. So that’s what Jessica ended up asking voters about, and so I want to play that for you.

jessica cheung What about him excites you? speaker 1 Bernie is the true progressive — the only true progressive — running in the race. speaker 2 Bernie doesn’t say, leave it to me. Bernie says, come with me. We must join forces to create the fundamental changes required in this society. speaker 3 If you look at Bernie’s record, Bernie has been just saying the same things since pretty much, like, the ‘60s or whenever he came into public office. jessica cheung The ‘80s. speaker 3 Yeah, sorry. jessica cheung It’s OK. speaker 3 The ‘80s, but the country moved around him. And so I think now, there’s a lot of people that are, like, jumping onto the bandwagon, and so I really just think it’s the strength of Bernie Sanders and his platform. speaker 4 He’s a prophet. He knows the way forward.

alexander burns

What you hear there is just the extraordinary stature that Sanders commands on the left. The real fruits of that campaign that he ran in 2015 and 2016, when he got out there into an ideological space that other Democrats were just not comfortable entering and ran an insurgent campaign against the party establishment in a way that most Democrats had really never seen before. So I think you rarely hear candidates referred to us as prophets, but even stopping short of that sort of quasi-religious language, the depth of commitment to Bernie Sanders among his supporters probably exceeds the bond that any other candidate in the race has with their voters.

michael barbaro

Greater even than Trump, or you mean greater even than anyone on the Democratic field?

alexander burns

On the Democratic side, I should say. It is probably closer to Trump than to any of the other Democrats.

michael barbaro

That’s fascinating. But I mean, at the end of the day, a vote is a vote no matter how enthusiastically someone casts it, right? So I wonder what this kind of next-level devotion means for his candidacy.

alexander burns

Well, it has meant that even in what was a very lean summer for him — just a challenging political time where he was being eclipsed by another candidate on the left, Elizabeth Warren — he has never really been at risk of being irrelevant in this race, of being truly sidelined, because right now, it looks like anywhere between 10 percent and 17 or 18 percent of the Democratic Party is very, very tightly bonded to Bernie Sanders.

michael barbaro

One out of five Democrats?

alexander burns

One out of five on a good day. Closer to one out of 10 on a bad day. But still, on his worst day, he’s got more support in the party than every other candidate in the race, except for Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. That’s a pretty good place to be. And his support is different from any other candidate in the race. It is particularly strong among young people. There’s the irony of the Bernie Sanders campaign — the guy who would be the oldest president ever, the oldest candidate in this race, his strongest age group is the youngest age group in the Democratic electorate. What it has also meant is that he has this incredible flow of cash into his campaign, almost irrespective of whatever else is happening in this race. He has a small donor online fundraising machine that has collected tens of millions of dollars for him every quarter that he has been in this race. And in the most recent quarter, he was the number one fundraiser in the Democratic field. That’s an extraordinary thing to say about a candidate who isn’t running a super PAC, isn’t holding conventional big donor events, and is running on Democratic socialism — that he’s the best-funded candidate in the race.

michael barbaro

Right. So his fundraising is outpacing his polling, which, correct me if I’m wrong, is quite unusual in politics.

alexander burns

Right. And you basically only see it when you have these candidates who have a limited but unbelievably passionate base of support.

michael barbaro

So it feels like Bernie Sanders is kind of a test case for why genuine enthusiasm matters so much in politics.

alexander burns

His supporters are willing to do things for him that other candidate’s supporters may not be. He is going to have an easier time staying financially competitive, mobilizing volunteers, and especially in some of these early voting, cold weather states in February, getting them to actually show up and caucus in Iowa in a blizzard, if necessary.

michael barbaro

They’ll do it.

alexander burns

They’ll do it.

michael barbaro

So the next thing that Jess asked voters about at this Sanders rally was this heart attack that Sanders had a couple of weeks ago.

jessica cheung This is its first rally since he just came back from a heart attack. I wonder if you think that that makes him less electable in any way? speaker 1 I don’t think age matters. I think that’s just stupid. Like, I don’t know why people care about that. speaker 2 No, because he came back stronger. And it was a routine procedure that many people go through. speaker 3 I know a lot of people that have had stents put in, and then felt better afterwards than before. And I think he looked great, so I’m going to stick with him. speaker 4 Well, the curious thing is that Bernie, having undergone this procedure, may feel, like, 110 percent better than he did before. Just the amount of literal blood flowing to his heart may give him a level of energy and stamina that he didn’t feel before he underwent the procedure. And he’s — speaker 5 I saw him play softball! speaker 6 I don’t think that our current president has the best health, so why are we worried so much about a heart attack that wasn’t a big deal? He went right back into it afterwards. speaker 7 Both George Bush Sr. and Clinton had the same operation done in their ‘60s, so — jessica cheung He’s also pushing 80, though. speaker 8 He is, but I mean, it doesn’t — I don’t — I’m not thinking about age. I’m thinking about — speaker 9 There’s a pretty heavy bias against Bernie Sanders because he’s a fairly unique candidate. Like, Joe Biden’s eye exploded while we were all watching a debate, and they didn’t single him out with a question like, hey, Joe, like, why did your eye explode? Like, is it going to happen again?

michael barbaro

Did I miss something? Did Joe Biden’s eye suffer some kind of explosion?

alexander burns

There was a CNN town hall where he had some kind of burst capillary in his eye or something like that. It was unsightly, but —

michael barbaro

Something did happen.

alexander burns

— not medically serious, yeah.

michael barbaro

So in summary, it feels like Sanders supporters in this crowd, they are not concerned about this heart attack. And I wonder what you think of the way it was discussed?

alexander burns

I think right after the heart attack happened, there was this moment of questioning, would Sanders persist in this race? Would his support collapse because people suddenly realize he’s almost 80 years old? Would his health become the defining issue of his candidacy? And at least for his supporters, the answer to all those things is no. They are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt on so much, and his physical health is not an exception to that. I think that you hear people giving rationalizations. It’s true that Bill Clinton had a similar operation. It was after he was the president of the United States. But the reality is a candidate having a heart attack is a really big deal. And historically, by any standard of political coverage, it is more than in bounds as a subject for scrutiny and for voters to consider. We’ve never had a president turn 80 in office before. We have two candidates in this race — two of the top three candidates in this race — would turn 80 in their first term as president if they were elected. People remember, I think, pretty well Hillary Clinton fainting at the 9/11 Memorial in the middle of the general election in 2016.

michael barbaro

I think she had pneumonia.

alexander burns

She had pneumonia. And you know, the Clinton campaign, I think, is still quite resentful of the way that was covered, but a candidate collapsing in the middle of a general election is a relevant subject for coverage. President Trump’s lack of transparency about his health has been a huge subject for coverage over the last few years. There’s enormous suspicion about whether we really know everything that we deserve to know about the president’s health. So this is not bias against Bernie Sanders, but the fact that people are inclined to see it as bias against Bernie Sanders, again, underscores the strength of his support.

michael barbaro

So you mentioned Hillary Clinton in 2016. Jessica encountered a lot of supporters who very much wanted to go back to that race and talk about what happened the last time around. And I want to play some of that.

speaker 1 We need to get Bernie elected this time around. The D.N.C. screwed him over in 2016. He was robbed of the nomination. So people want Bernie. speaker 2 I think it’s the race we needed to have in 2016. I think there’s a populist feel going on. The elites are destroying the country. And the Democrats lost because we ran an elitist. And now, it’s time to run a candidate with a multiracial working-class coalition. speaker 3 He knows that the Democrats are just as corrupt as Republicans, because there has been evidence that the D.N.C. did screw with caucuses — that in Seattle, he won by a landslide, but the delegates voted for Hillary anyway.

michael barbaro

So Alex, what do you make of that?

alexander burns

I think there are a lot of myths about the role of the D.N.C. in 2016, but the valid core to all of that is the sense among Sanders supporters — and this is really not up for debate — that the Democratic Party establishment did everything they could to give Hillary Clinton an advantage over him in that primary.

michael barbaro

Remind us of that, just so we can have it in hand.

alexander burns

You had everyone at the top of the party, including President Obama, do what they could to clear the field for Hillary Clinton. You had the leadership of the party in both houses of Congress try to clear the way for Hillary Clinton. You had other kinds of coordination between party officials who were supposed to be neutral, who were ostensibly neutral, and leaders of the Clinton campaign in ways that none of it was illegal and none of it was outside of the American political tradition, but if you’re a Bernie Sanders supporter, and you looked at that, and you felt like there ought to be an even playing field in this race, there wasn’t.

michael barbaro

I wonder how that makes a Bernie Sanders supporter relate to the Democratic Party and to everyone else in the field who identifies as a Democrat, especially if Sanders starts to falter.

alexander burns

This is one of the Trumpiest things about Bernie Sanders and his political movement — that in 2015, 2016, one of the best predictors of support for Donald Trump in the Republican primary was dislike for the Republican Party. He is obviously now come to embody the Republican Party, so that dynamic has changed, but you have a lot of people in the Democratic Party or on the left who are Democratic primary voters supporting Bernie Sanders and do not like the Democratic Party. It’s something that really frustrates more mainline Democrats — that they feel like Bernie is this interloper who is sort of rousing the left against the only party that really speaks to them. But if you are a Bernie Sanders supporter, you look at the traditional Democratic Party establishment as a collection of people and ideas that have failed.

[music]

michael barbaro

And what about the candidates?

alexander burns

Well, that is one of the great questions of this race — if Bernie is not the nominee, whether his core supporters will embrace another candidate with similar enthusiasm.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

jessica cheung One of the candidates, Elizabeth Warren, shares very similar policy positions. She’s also a liberal populist. I wonder what makes you continue your support for Bernie over Elizabeth Warren? speaker 1 Warren calls herself a capitalist, and she’s not out for a political revolution. I don’t know if I trust Warren. speaker 2 It’s hard to believe her when she still doesn’t have a Medicare for all policy on her website. speaker 3 It seems like now that she’s kind of just adopting a lot of the things that he was saying his whole life, pretty much. speaker 4 She is taking all of Bernie’s policies and kind of putting a spin on it. And it’s like, do you have any original ideas? And if she believed in these things, why wasn’t she supporting them four years ago? speaker 5 And you know, Warren used to be a Republican. speaker 6 Warren used to be a Republican. speaker 7 She was a Republican, and so, like, Elizabeth Warren, I feel like, is just a watered-down form of Bernie to try to make her more appealing, but the second the primary is over, she’s just going to pivot.

michael barbaro

Well?

alexander burns

Look, that’s really striking. She’s not been a Republican since I was in primary school, which was a while ago. But the fact that Sanders supporters have latched onto that in the way they have, I think, reflects just the gap in trust between how they feel about Bernie and how they feel about almost literally any other politician, certainly any other politician running for president.

michael barbaro

It still feels surprising to hear Sanders supporters attempt to differentiate a Democratic rival who, on paper, is so ideologically similar.

alexander burns

I think there are some important ideological distinctions, at least in the abstract. That I think in Elizabeth Warren’s ideal world, we would be a heavily regulated, heavily enforced, free-market economy — that it would be something similar to an F.D.R., Teddy Roosevelt kind regulatory regime. Bernie Sanders would, I think in his ideal world, have us much closer to a sort of Scandinavian social democracy, which is a really fundamentally different way of approaching government. And part of this is a dynamic that happens in primaries generally — that the candidates who are ideologically closest together can end up having the most sort of intense hostility between their supporters because they feel like only one of these people can emerge from this. And they’re right. But there is I think also a level of seeing the trees, but not the forest here, where you have the number two and number three candidates in this Democratic primary, if they were nominated, would be the most liberal nominee in, certainly, my lifetime and in lifetimes a good deal longer than mine as well. So the level of frustration does seem sort of out of proportion to what the downside of an Elizabeth Warren nomination would be.

michael barbaro

So Alex, to your point about the forest for the trees, Jess asked a lot of these voters, if Sanders doesn’t win, are you fine voting for anybody else in the party who becomes the nominee? And this is what people said.

jessica cheung And who is your second candidate of choice? speaker 1 Elizabeth Warren. speaker 2 If Bernie can’t make it, I’m happy with Elizabeth. speaker 3 If either Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders win the nomination, I would be so happy. And I think it would be, again, a sign of how much the Democratic Party is shifting. speaker 4 I do like Elizabeth Warren’s policies. And like, if Elizabeth Warren is the nominee, I’ll happily vote for her.

michael barbaro

So a lot of them, despite their skepticism of Warren, say, if I had to, I would vote for Elizabeth Warren. But then there were several voters who said that they would be very hard-pressed to turn out for anyone who wasn’t Bernie or what they consider to be kind of Bernie-lite, which is Warren.

speaker Sure, so I like Liz Warren. I think she’s probably the only other candidate I would ever even consider supporting. The rest of them, I find to be rather embarrassing. jessica cheung If it wasn’t Bernie, who’s your second candidate of choice? speaker If it wasn’t, I would probably vote for Elizabeth, if she was the candidate. I wouldn’t vote for Biden.

michael barbaro

That’s really interesting.

alexander burns

It really is. And I guess as they say in the Senate, I should revise and extend what I said about people sort of missing the forest — that you do hear people there sort of recognizing that the party as a whole has moved, that there are candidates besides Bernie, although clearly anyone else would be the second-best choice in this race for them. But I think what you heard is how hard it will be for a candidate who is not an economic populist to speak to this set of voters, that if you end up with a candidate who is an avowed centrist or a nominee who has repudiated what Bernie Sanders stands for — hasn’t just revised or watered down his views, but has rejected them and attacked them — that’s going to be a real challenge in the general election. I think one of the calculations the Democrats have traditionally made — certainly made in 2016 — is that the left will come home at the end of the day. And I think you saw in 2016, that was a risky bet to make.

michael barbaro

Right. I mean, that was a bet that just did not come true, because when Sanders supporters were asked to support Hillary Clinton, many of them did not. In fact, as we know from Times analysis, a meaningful number of them voted for Trump.

alexander burns

In the 2016 primary, it wasn’t just liberals who voted for Sanders in the Democratic primary. There were people who were just sort of disaffected and outside the system, people who wanted a populist, not necessarily somebody who is an ideological liberal as we traditionally think of it, people who just didn’t like Hillary Clinton. And then in the general election, there were people who were Democrats, who just weren’t enthusiastic. They would have turned out to vote for Bernie Sanders, would’ve volunteered for Bernie Sanders, would have donated to Bernie Sanders. And when you start to look at the margins of defeat for Hillary Clinton in the states that made the difference — Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania — could Democratic enthusiasm have turned out an additional 70,000 voters? Very possibly.

michael barbaro

So not to be too prescriptive, but based on everything you’re saying, if Joe Biden is the nominee, it will be a challenge, maybe a significant challenge, for this group of voters to be won over and transferred to him. If it is Elizabeth Warren, that will be more logical, although it will not necessarily be seamless.

alexander burns

I think that’s probably a safe bet. And if you’re Joe Biden, you know, maybe you can bring these people around, maybe you need to make up for a lack of enthusiasm on the left by winning over voters closer to the political middle, even folks on the center-right. That’s clearly a bet that candidates like Joe Biden are making — that if Bernie has his populist following that would be much more enthusiastic about him than about me, well, I have moderates who will never vote for a Democratic socialist, but who I can turn out in a general election. And in a lot of ways, this is the big strategic debate in the Democratic Party right now. We’ve talked a lot about the ideological and policy debates in the party, but sort of fundamental to the Democratic race right now is, are you better off trying to marshal a really enthusiastic and diverse coalition on the left or a more ideologically diverse coalition that is somewhat less reliant on liberal enthusiasm?

[music]

alexander burns

For whoever the nominee is in this election, and I think probably in most elections going forward, just given the ideological and demographic trajectory of the Democratic Party and the country, it’s going to be a recurring challenge for them. How do you harness what Bernie Sanders has created, while also appealing broadly to the voters that you need in order to capture the nomination, because Sanders is not actually doing that right now, and win a general election, which Sanders has never had the chance to try to do? And it’s a particularly important question when you look to the future of the Democratic Party. If you were to sort of make a bet right now about the trajectory of that party over the next few years, it will probably look more and more like the Bernie Sanders base and less and less like the coalition that defeated him in 2016 if the party stays on its current course. This is a group of voters that is very much here to stay. And the question is, do they stay as engaged and enthusiastic Democrats?

michael barbaro

Right, or do they basically start and finish their political journey with Bernie Sanders in a way that doesn’t really help the party?

alexander burns

Do they become passionate lifelong Democratic voters, volunteers, donors, or do they go back to being either casually engaged with politics, or disengaged entirely, or really sort of disgusted with the party as they were in 2016?

michael barbaro

Alex, thank you very much.

alexander burns

Thank you.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (lindsey graham) O.K., I have introduced a resolution today with Senator McConnell. And the purpose of the resolution is to let the House know that the process you’re engaging in regarding the attempted impeachment of President Trump is a substantial deviation from what the House has done in the past.

michael barbaro

The Republican campaign to challenge the legitimacy of the House impeachment inquiry escalated on Thursday, as Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina introduced a resolution condemning it as unorthodox and improper. Graham focused on the closed-door hearings led by Representative Adam Schiff, despite the fact that Republicans themselves conducted closed-door testimony during the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998. And in his latest effort to break the deadlock over Brexit after yet another major delay, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would seek a new general election in December.

archived recording (boris johnson) We’re being very, very reasonable. We’re saying if you genuinely want more time, you can have it. Here it is. But the condition for that is that we all agree to go for a general election on December the 12th.

michael barbaro

Johnson hopes that such an election would give him a popular mandate to carry out his vision of a swift Brexit, despite deep resistance within Parliament, whose support is needed for such an election. In an interview with the BBC, Johnson defended the strategy, which his opponents in Parliament say is a form of political intimidation designed to scare them into supporting his plan.

archived recording But prime minister, it’s not standard behavior. You’re essentially trying to blackmail Parliament with the threat of an election in order to ram through your bill. You could just say, fine, let’s have as long as it takes to get through this line by line in Parliament. Would that not be the responsible thing to do? archived recording (boris johnson) Now, come on. We’ve had three and a half years of this. archived recording Not looking at this bill.

He Knows He Can’t Slip Now.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/us/politics/bernie-sanders-iowa.html,"The sudden flurry of attention represents a change from earlier this year, when White House hopefuls appeared to be embracing a more national campaign strategy that took them beyond Iowa and other early nominating states. The growth of social media, the changes to the electoral calendar and the increasing diversity of the Democratic electorate combined to make it seem like Iowa, a predominantly white state, might lose its sway in the primary process.

“Usually there’s a ramp-up period in past presidential cycles,” said Sean Bagniewski, the Democratic chair in Polk County, about the focus on Iowa. “This year, it was like a thunderclap.”

The stakes in Iowa for Mr. Sanders have personal and psychological dimensions. After his surprising performance in the caucuses in 2016, some aides said the state has taken on an almost mystical quality. A weak result could also indicate that he does not have the same influence with progressive voters as he used to.

Despite a series of disappointing polls in the state — a Suffolk University/USA Today poll released this week showed him in fourth place — allies are confident he is still in a position to do well.

Like it did in 2016, the Sanders campaign is betting on an extensive ground game that relies heavily on a vast network of volunteers that they hope will motivate other supporters to turn out on caucus night — including people who do not typically participate in the political process.

His aides believe that the technique, known as distributed organizing, will help motivate unlikely or first-time caucusgoers, especially those who were too young to participate in the last presidential caucuses; Latino voters, whose turnout rate in the caucuses is typically low; and working-class voters. The campaign sees high potential for victory particularly in and around college towns, like Ames and Iowa City, and in rural areas.

To solidify his base of support, he has spent hours rallying on college campuses in an effort to capture the support of young voters. He has courted labor support particularly in counties along the Mississippi River. And he has held multiple “Unidos con Bernie” events with Latino voters."

Then the fracking revolution came about, and the U.S. resumed its long-lost place as the world’s No. 1 oil and natural gas producer.

The result: lower oil prices for American consumers, less dependence on petrodespots, a dramatic shift from coal to natural gas for electricity generation (with concomitant benefits in carbon emissions), and hundreds of thousands of working-class jobs, including tens of thousands in swing states like Colorado and Pennsylvania.

Elizabeth Warren wants to kill all this.

Who’s winning? The polls don’t know

Four polls out this week presented a muddled picture of how the Democratic primary is unfolding."
224,Steve Sanders,Those who cheer the arrests of the University of Connecticut students might ask themselves whether they would be equally happy with a prosecutor who decided that it was criminal ridicule for someone to walk down the street uttering the N-word while reciting r… [+2869 chars],"They were guilty of vulgarity and ignorance, but “ridicule” is not a crime.",2019-10-25,The New York Times,Those College Students Who Used the N-Word Shouldn’t Have Been Arrested,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/opinion/uconn-students-arrested.html,"Those who cheer the arrests of the University of Connecticut students might ask themselves whether they would be equally happy with a prosecutor who decided that it was criminal “ridicule” for someone to walk down the street uttering a racial slur while reciting rap lyrics. But that’s not ridicule, you say? Well, that’s the point: Who should be trusted to decide such things when fines, jail time and expulsion from college loom as possible consequences?

Second, federal courts consistently have struck down speech codes at public universities that punished students who engaged in undefined “acts of intolerance” or who “stigmatized” others based on their race, religion, sexuality or other characteristic. One such decision invalidated a university speech code that imposed discipline for “threats, insults, epithets, ridicule or personal attacks.”

The reasoning in those cases — that speech may not be censored or punished for its content — also applies in the University of Connecticut case. Here, there was not even an identifiable target of the offensive speech, just a bystander with a cellphone. (Moreover, it appears that the Connecticut law, which was enacted a century ago, was intended to apply only to some form of “advertisement,” making the use of the law to criminalize the students’ speech even more misguided.)

To be sure, speech may be punished when the words used are likely to produce what the Supreme Court has called “imminent lawless action,” such as physical violence. But this leads to the third reason Connecticut’s anti-ridicule statute is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court case that established that rule, Brandenburg v. Ohio in 1969, involved the prosecution of Ku Klux Klansmen who were filmed uttering repulsive racist statements — including the N-word. But as in the case of the University of Connecticut students, the Klansmen’s words provoked no action, and the Ohio law under which the men were prosecuted was struck down under the First Amendment.

In the face of an absurd statute like Connecticut’s anti-ridicule law, it is tempting to extol the value of satire, irreverence and cheek as part of our country’s robust free-speech traditions. But this is not the time for that. Racial, ethnic, sexual and religious slurs exact a social cost. They deprive members of the affected groups of their dignity and inhibit their participation in our democracy as equal citizens.

But it is possible to hold that thought in mind while keeping in mind another thought: that we do not want the police or prosecutors — or university administrators, who too often cave in to public pressure in such situations — wielding the power to decide what constitutes “ridicule” and when someone should be hauled up on charges for engaging in it.

The debate will be held on Dec. 19 and sponsored by PBS NewsHour and Politico. The format and moderators have not yet been announced. Another debate is scheduled for Nov. 20, sponsored by MSNBC and The Washington Post.

In an effort to narrow the number of candidates after the largest debate ever in October, the D.N.C. is raising its thresholds for the December debate. It will require candidates to have at least 200,000 individual donors and meet one of two polling requirements: They must either receive 4 percent support in four national or early-state polls conducted by qualifying pollsters, or 6 percent support in two polls in the four early states — Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina."

Candidates of color are languishing in the low single digits in polls, well behind the four leaders — former Vice President Joseph R.

But 10 months later, the Democratic field has a top tier of four white candidates, three of them men.

Candidates of color are languishing in the low single digits in polls, well behind the four leaders — former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. The divide could become even more pronounced in the coming months: Because of new, more rigorous thresholds for the Democratic debate in December, it is possible that only one nonwhite candidate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, will qualify.

With the Iowa caucuses three months away, it’s a noticeable sorting of the field for an increasingly multiracial party, whose most recent White House victories were powered by a strong minority turnout for a black nominee. It has frustrated the Democrats seeking a more diverse party leadership — not to mention the affected candidates.

“I’ve had lots of crazy things said to me, like, ‘Is America ready for another black president?’” Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said in an interview. “And I’m confident it’s never been asked of a white candidate, ‘Is America ready for another white president?’”"

LOS ANGELES — At one smoldering end of California, Capt. Alex Arriola and hundreds of other firefighters charged up flaming hillsides in the middle of the night Monday to battle a brush fire that exploded on the tinder-dry edge of West Los Angeles.

As helicopters doused the hills to protect the priceless artworks at the nearby Getty Center and homes went up in flames, the fire crews on the ground began attacking the blaze to keep it from leaping across the street and taking out other multimillion-dollar houses.

“It was pretty much chaos,” said Captain Arriola, a 34-year veteran of the Los Angeles Fire Department."

Re “Anxious Democrats Ask, ‘Is There Anybody Else?’” (news article, Oct. 23):

It’s hard to find good news regarding our politics. Yet seeing Sherrod Brown’s name in this article is heartening. It’s not that the Democrats don’t have good-to-great candidates. They do. But each is flawed enough to risk giving this country another four years with President Trump.

Senator Brown, from Ohio, is uniquely positioned — smart, compassionate, Midwestern, union-friendly, reasonable about supporting a public option as opposed to “Medicare for all” — to ensure a win. What can we do to entice him to jump in now?

There is still plenty of time for former Vice President Al Gore to run for president. He has integrity, experience and great name recognition, and he was ahead of most in recognizing the urgency of addressing man-made climate change. Perhaps most important, he is the only candidate who has won a presidential election — though five Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices took away his victory.

When will the Democratic National Committee listen to its base? Instead of celebrating the most diverse and progressive group ever, big donors and top Democratic Party leaders keep searching. The polls show that all three leading candidates — Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden — can beat President Trump, so that’s not their real worry."

The issue is a talking point among Democratic presidential candidates. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) has called for a nationwide ban on police use of facial recognition. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) have both called for regulations on facial-recognition technology as part of their criminal-justice platforms.

Also worrying for corporations is a bill that Sen. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.) and Sen. Brian Schatz (D., Hawaii) introduced in March. The Commercial Facial Recognition Privacy Act would limit companies’ ability to share facial-recognition data and would prohibit the use of the technology unless a business obtains consent from the people it is used on and provides notice and documentation explaining how the technology works. The bill hasn’t made it to a committee vote.

Nine industry groups—including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Security Industry Association and the American Association of Airport Executives—sent a letter dated Oct. 16 to more than a dozen House and Senate lawmakers urging them not to support strict limits on the use of facial-recognition technology.

“[W]e are concerned that a moratorium on the use of facial recognition technology would be premature and have unintended consequences not only for innovation, safety, and security but for the continued improvement of the technology’s accuracy and effectiveness,” the letter said.

Retailers, airports, stadiums and other businesses have already started rolling out facial-recognition tools to improve security and speed up customer check-ins.

“We’re not opposed to regulation, but we oppose a ban,” said Tim Day, senior vice president of the Chamber of Commerce’s Technology Engagement Center. “There should be guardrails in place to allow the technology to move forward in a smart way.”

The Chamber has convened a facial-recognition working group of about 40 companies from sectors including retail and transportation. The group plans to release model legislation for facial recognition by year-end and to lobby lawmakers to draft and vote for laws that are in line with those guidelines, Mr. Day said.

San Francisco; Oakland, Calif.; and Somerville, Mass., have passed laws banning government agencies from using the technology.

California has prohibited facial-recognition software in police body cameras: Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed the bill into law this month. The legislation, which becomes effective in January and expires after three years, doesn’t apply to the private sector.

Some companies, meanwhile, are pointing to the benefits that facial recognition brings.

Miami International Airport, which is affiliated with Airports Council International—North America, has cut passenger screening wait times by up to 80% over the past year, thanks in part to a biometrics-only concourse screening facility, according to a Miami-Dade Aviation Department spokesman.

In January, the airport started using the technology for entry screening on up to 10 international flights a day, and it is testing facial recognition for boarding on “a few daily flights,” the spokesman said. The plan is to eventually expand both programs airport-wide.

Such programs would be hampered if facial recognition bans were passed, Mr. Day said.

In Europe, laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation, which prohibits companies from processing facial-recognition data unless certain circumstances apply, have slowed and in some cases halted the rollout of the technology, said Heikki Koski, chief digital officer at Finavia, the state-owned operator of 21 Finnish airports.

Helsinki Airport is undergoing a €1 billion ($1.11 billion) expansion set to be completed in 2022, and it is considering using facial recognition in new check-in and security facilities, Mr. Koski said. But aviation officials haven’t decided whether to proceed because of the challenges of complying with strict data-privacy laws.

Under the GDPR, organizations can be fined up to €20 million or 4% of global annual revenue, whichever is larger. In August, the Swedish Data Protection Authority fined a municipality about €20,000 for conducting a facial-recognition pilot to keep track of students’ school attendance.

The Swedish authority found that the pilot violated the GDPR. The school failed to perform an adequate impact assessment and consult with Swedish privacy authorities before processing biometric data, it said. Consent from the students wasn’t valid, it added, because of the “clear imbalance” between the students and the school.

“There are many obstacles to solve before we will see widespread implementation here,” Mr. Koski said.

But after watching Trump’s performance on Sunday, I went back and watched Obama’s 2011 announcement of Osama bin Laden’s death. It was dignified and eloquent. And then I watched George H.W. Bush’s February 1991 announcement of victory in the Persian Gulf war, when he said this was “certainly not a time to gloat.” What a contrast these two presidents provide! What depressing reminders of what presidential behavior used to look like!

Gail: We’re witnessing the birth of a new, 21st-century bottom line for presidential performances. Imagine the most awful loudmouthed bully in your high school. If it’s better than that it’s achieved the new minimum.

Bret: I’m as glad as anyone that al-Baghdadi is dead, and glad also that he was killed thanks to American action. I’m also sorry he murdered three children in the bargain. But whatever we accomplished against ISIS with his death we undermined with our withdrawal from northern Syria, which has jeopardized the continued imprisonment of thousands of captured ISIS terrorists.

Gail: Truly the bottom line rule of this administration is that no news is ever going to be really good. D.J.T. will always find a way to make it awful.

Bret: May I switch the subject, though? As bad as things are going for Trump, I fear they are going worse for Democrats. The presidential field is just a mess.

Gail: So glad you asked. When I’m out on the road, everybody asks if there’s any problem having these political arguments, given that you and I clearly get along so well. I always say that the main difficulty is fighting with someone who despises Donald Trump even more than I do. Then I add that if things get too convivial, I just bring up Elizabeth Warren.

Bret: Thank goodness for that.

Gail: I don’t find the field all that disheartening. I think Warren could be a very good president. I do worry about electability. But she’s getting to be a better campaigner every day. And if Biden demonstrates over the next months that he can hang in there and take care of business, I’m fine with him. Buttigieg is too young and green, but if the primary voters don’t care, I’m good with him as president. The only serious candidate I have real reservations about is Bernie Sanders, who does not seem to play all that well with others. But compared with Donald Trump, he’s Franklin Roosevelt."
