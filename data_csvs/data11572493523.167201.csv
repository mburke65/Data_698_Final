Their tax proposals are helping to galvanize those on the left, but their ideas will also provide fodder for Republicans eager to paint them in a general election as tax-happy and too liberal.

Polls have found widespread support for the idea of taxing wealth. A poll conducted for The New York Times by the internet research firm SurveyMonkey this summer found that two-thirds of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, backed a 2 percent tax on households worth over $50 million, which is the heart of Ms. Warren’s plan.

The proposals for a wealth tax are among a variety of ideas for collecting more tax revenue that Democratic presidential candidates have put forward. On Monday, Mr. Sanders proposed a new tax on corporations that have a huge gap between what they pay their chief executive and their median worker. Jared Bernstein, who was chief economist for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. from 2009 to 2011, said he has discussed with the Biden campaign a proposal to tax financial transactions.

[The latest data and analysis to keep track of who’s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.]

On the campaign trail, Ms. Warren explains the concept of a wealth tax by putting it in familiar terms, likening it to the property taxes that many Americans pay on their homes. For the superrich, she said in South Carolina on Saturday, “how about we include in yours not only your real estate, but also your stock portfolio, the diamonds, the Rembrandt and the yacht?”

Mr. Sanders is blunt about his desire to reduce the size of America’s biggest fortunes, even highlighting how much individual billionaires would have to pay in taxes under his proposal. He said last week that he did not believe billionaires should exist in the United States.

“There’s no question to my mind that the United States is moving toward an oligarchy,” Mr. Sanders said. “This is an issue that has to be addressed, and this wealth tax begins to do that.”"

Ms. Warren rolled out a proposal to break up Facebook, Amazon and other tech giants in March. To ensure that tech workers got her message, her campaign paid for a billboard near a major transit station in San Francisco. It read “Break Up Big Tech,” in capital letters.

On Tuesday, nearly seven months after Ms. Warren first unveiled her plan, The Verge offered a window into what Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, thinks about it.

Mr. Biden’s campaign has said he scored his best week of fund-raising since the second week of the campaign as Democrats initiated an impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump over a whistle-blower complaint claiming that Mr. Trump prodded the president of Ukraine to investigate the business dealings there of Mr. Biden’s son Hunter Biden.

Still, some Biden supporters are nervous about how the impeachment process, and any added scrutiny of Hunter Biden’s business affairs, will play out. Some have even discussed creating a super PAC, which the campaign quickly disavowed. Others see in Ms. Warren’s rise as a top rival, with Mr. Sanders in third, an opportunity for Mr. Biden to truly consolidate a donor class that has remained fractured.

Mr. Biden’s ability to attract small donors will be closely scrutinized. In the last 90 days, his campaign ranked 10th among the Democratic presidential candidates for advertising dollars on Facebook, where campaigns often prospect for new contributors. He spent less than one-quarter of what Mr. Buttigieg had spent on the platform in that time, and well less than half of what Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders had spent, according to Facebook data.

Mr. Biden told donors at a sushi restaurant in Los Angeles last week that he had nearly 670,000 donations overall with an average donation of $46, which would translate to only about $10.8 million this quarter. A Biden campaign official said the former vice president had not presented the “full picture” but declined to elaborate.

A Biden campaign official said Tuesday that the former vice president had “unequivocally’’ raised enough money to be competitive in the primary race, and that details would be released soon.

Two other top tier candidates, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., have yet to release their third-quarter totals.

Zuckerberg would take Warren to court over a Facebook breakup plan

In leaked audio conversations with Facebook employees, Mark Zuckerberg can be heard saying he would sue Senator Elizabeth Warren if she moved to break up Facebook, Matt Stevens of the NYT reports.

Ms. Warren has said she would split up big tech companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon if she becomes president.

“If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in recordings from a July internal meeting published by The Verge. “Does that still suck for us? Yeah.”

The recordings pit a leading Democrat candidate for president against a tech giant “at a time when Silicon Valley in general and Facebook in particular continue to be scrutinized for their efforts to combat disinformation and prevent election interference in 2020 and beyond,” Mr. Stevens writes."

She has breached 20 percent of the vote in recent national surveys and might hold a narrow lead in Iowa and New Hampshire. The prediction markets now consider her a clear favorite to win the nomination. It can be hard to see how her Democratic rivals will attack or stop her.

But the challenge facing Ms. Warren, if past primaries are any indication, isn’t those rivals. It is whether she will hit a wall: the rank and file of the Democratic primary electorate.

In primary after primary, the candidates of the party’s left-liberal activists have failed to win the more typical members of the Democratic Party. These voters don’t show up at rallies or post on political Twitter. They are more moderate. They are disproportionately nonwhite; Southern; and less likely to have graduated from college. But in the modern era, they have usually had the votes to decide the nomination. In August, t hey even had the votes to sway an Iowa straw poll to Joe Biden when other candidates attracted far bigger crowds at the same fai r.

To win the nomination, Ms. Warren will need to advance beyond her factional base to a broader coalition. Historically, many left-liberal candidates have found it easy to attract 20-plus percent in the polls and five-digit crowds on the stump. Howard Dean (2004) and Bernie Sanders (2016) had done so by this point in the election cycle. But such candidates have found it far harder to win."

First, they’re based on a premise that the American economy is doing just fine and we shouldn’t mess with success. But as the statistics above make clear, the economy is not doing fine. The country should be looking for new approaches.

Second, while it’s plausible that a wealth tax might further depress economic growth, it’s also plausible that a wealth tax would accelerate economic growth. Somehow, the opponents leave out that part.

How would it accelerate growth? Right now, the American economy is suffering from extreme inequality. A large portion of society’s resources are held by a tiny slice of people, who aren’t using the resources very efficiently. As my colleague Paul Krugman wrote this week, referring to Warren’s plans, “The only people who would be directly affected by her tax proposals are those who more or less literally have more money than they know what to do with.”

Sure, it’s theoretically possible that some entrepreneurs and investors might work less hard because of a 2 percent annual tax on their holdings above $50 million (the tax threshold under the Warren plan), thus sapping economic growth. But it’s more likely that any such effect would be small — and more than outweighed by the return that the economy would get on the programs that a wealth tax would finance, like education, scientific research, infrastructure and more. Those basic investments all have a long record of lifting economic growth. The very wealthy, however, don’t tend to spend much of their money building roads, starting community colleges or financing clean energy.

So don’t be fooled by the scaremongering. A wealth tax would have a significant effect on the economy’s distribution but probably only a modest effect on the growth rate. And if anything, the tax is likely to be pro-growth."

The problem is that his existential crisis — instead of being about the damage his giant social media company might be causing our society — is all about the trustbusting stylings of Senator Elizabeth Warren.

Thanks to Casey Newton of The Verge — a tech news organization that I work with in my role as an editor for Vox Media, the parent company of The Verge — this week we got to hear what Mr. Zuckerberg really thinks. On Tuesday, the Verge released an audio recording of the Facebook chief executive talking to employees in a closed-door Q. and A. session. Mr. Zuckerberg’s frank words were not meant for public consumption.

Ms. Warren, the intense and substantive politician who has morphed into the Teddy Roosevelt of the digital age, is clearly top of mind for Silicon Valley’s man-boy king. From the sound of it, she really, really bugs him. Consider this stemwinder from Mr. Zuckerberg, someone who usually is at a loss for words:

So there might be a political movement where people are angry at the tech companies or are worried about concentration or worried about different issues and worried that they’re not being handled well. That doesn’t mean that, even if there’s anger and that you have someone like Elizabeth Warren who thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies … I mean, if she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don’t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. I mean, that’s not the position that you want to be in when you’re, you know, I mean … it’s like, we care about our country and want to work with our government and do good things. But look, at the end of the day, if someone’s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.

(The network has monetized this lightly condescending label with a set of MSNBC Mom tote bags and latte mugs.) Molly Jong-Fast, a former novelist who once described her pre-Trump self as “completely selfish and disinterested in politics” and who is now a liberal Twitter influencer and columnist for the Never Trump site The Bulwark, told me that Maddow “made wonkiness cool.”

Recently, I went to dinner at the home of Rebecca Kee, a preschool principal in San Francisco who turned to Maddow in her depression and confusion over the 2016 election. I brought a bottle of rosé, and she poured it into glasses decorated with charms that featured Russia-investigation figures on one side and characters from “Star Trek: The Next Generation” on the other. I sipped from the Hope Hicks/Beverly Crusher glass, and we watched Maddow’s show over veggie enchiladas. “I think of her as a news doula: You know the news is going to be painful no matter what, so we might as well have someone who helps us survive it,” Kee told me. Last year, Kee had a Maddow-themed birthday party, at which her friends and her two young sons put on big black glasses and slicked their hair to the side. Also in attendance was a life-size cardboard cutout of Maddow, which is now in storage so as not to startle guests.

On TV, Maddow appears in slim black blazers over black shirts. She wears smoky eye shadow and subtly glossy lipstick, and her short hair is swept elegantly away from her forehead. The only tell that her business-casual femininity is a mirage created for television is that she has not modified her look for 11 years. It is a uniform she selected for work and steps into every day, so that she never has to make an aesthetic choice that can be picked apart by the commentariat and elevated above what she has to say. When the show is over, she wipes off her makeup, removes her contacts and changes into her civilian clothing.

When I picked her up from rehab, she wore glasses, a denim shirt and jeans, and a vintage belt buckle engraved with the words “Texas Nuclear,” signaling one of her obsessions: This month, she publishes her second book, “Blowout,” about the political impact of the oil-and-gas industry. She has described herself as “a cross between the jock and the antisocial girl who bit people” in a John Hughes film, and it tracks: She could be the love child of Ally Sheedy and Emilio Estevez.

“This is the hardest part of my day,” Maddow said as she approached the nickel-bronze revolving doors of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, before lifting her crutches and hopping easily through the obstacle. Just as she approached the threshold of the secure elevator bank, Maddow was detained by another fan, who pulled her back into the lobby for one more selfie.

“People think I have secret information,” Maddow told me. “I definitely get the instant, like, But what’s the real story?” Recently, she said on air that she expects more Democratic candidates to drop out of the presidential race soon, and she had to instantly clarify that she was not some kind of soothsayer divining answers from the wonk crystal ball that she keeps tucked under the anchor desk. When she told me this, she waved her arms in front of her, as if wielding a pair of orange safety batons on the tarmac of her reputation. Then she mimicked herself desperately trying to ground her viewers: “I don’t know that any candidate is going to drop out! I am just surmising from publicly available data!”"

Now, several Democratic presidential candidates are proposing that parents who stay home to care for children be paid, too. It’s a twist on typical family policies — like paid leave, subsidized child care or the right to work part-time — all of which make it easier for parents to have jobs outside the home. Instead, this proposal would make it easier for them not to.

It’s an idea that blurs partisan lines. On the left, there have long been calls to recognize the economic value of unpaid domestic labor by paying for it. At the same time, many on the left fear that paying at-home parents — who are most often women — would reinforce unequal gender roles and set women back in the labor force.

On the right, proponents appreciate that the proposal supports traditional families and allows young children to be home with a parent. Yet many on the right resist the expansion of government benefits, especially without work requirements."

Thanks to a nearly $25 million fund-raising bounty in the spring, which he topped up with a respectable $19.1 million over the summer, as reported Tuesday, Mr. Buttigieg has been able to invest in a gold-plated ground game in Iowa as he seeks to challenge two candidates who have been organizing for longer here, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders .

“We’re entering the stage where the rubber meets the road,” Mr. Buttigieg said in an interview as his four-day trip wrapped up last week. “ In order to settle the question of electability , the best thing you can do is perform well in an actual election. Iowa’s of course the first. And so that’s where a lot of our focus is going to go.”

Grass-roots organizing is essential to a strong caucus finish. Word of mouth about a candidate is often what turns people out on a cold February night. The Buttigieg campaign, which opened its bus tour to live-tweeting journalists in an effort to set itself apart, is also road-testing a somewhat novel approach to organizing.

Zuckerberg would take Warren to court over a Facebook breakup plan

In leaked audio conversations with Facebook employees, Mark Zuckerberg can be heard saying he would sue Senator Elizabeth Warren if she moved to break up Facebook, Matt Stevens of the NYT reports.

Ms. Warren has said she would split up big tech companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon if she becomes president.

“If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in recordings from a July internal meeting published by The Verge. “Does that still suck for us? Yeah.”

The recordings pit a leading Democrat candidate for president against a tech giant “at a time when Silicon Valley in general and Facebook in particular continue to be scrutinized for their efforts to combat disinformation and prevent election interference in 2020 and beyond,” Mr. Stevens writes."

Facebook is too powerful

The anti-monopolist spirit that animates Ms. Warren’s policy has found an unlikely vessel in Chris Hughes, who created Facebook with Mr. Zuckerberg when the two were roommates at Harvard. In a nearly 6,000-word Op-Ed for The Times, Mr. Hughes argues that Mr. Zuckerberg, whom he considers a “good, kind person,” simply has more influence over how businesses and people relate than any individual should. (Here are five takeaways from his piece.) “Mark’s power,” he says, “is unprecedented and un-American,” and must be curtailed. He writes:

Facebook has earned the prize of domination. It is worth half a trillion dollars and commands, by my estimate, more than 80 percent of the world’s social networking revenue. It is a powerful monopoly, eclipsing all of its rivals and erasing competition from the social networking category.

Mr. Hughes contends that Facebook’s dominance prohibits would-be entrepreneurs from creating alternative social networks, suffocating innovation and restricting consumer choice. The damage extends to industries beyond tech, including journalism, whose business model was broken by Facebook’s and Google’s capture of digital advertising revenue. In warning about the dangers of Facebook’s monopolistic ambitions, Mr. Hughes cites Tim Wu, a Columbia Law School professor and the author of “The Curse of Bigness,” who told Wired’s editor, Nicholas Thompson:

Mark Zuckerberg wrote an email when he was acquiring Instagram that was disclosed in the New York Post, and it suggests he was buying Instagram because he saw it as a competitive threat. Now, it is a felony under U.S. law to buy companies that you believe are competitive threats to you. … The American way is that we believe in competition and that companies should fight it out, not buy each other when there’s serious competition.

But the most pernicious aspect of Facebook’s hegemony, Mr. Hughes says, is Mr. Zuckerberg’s “unilateral control over speech.” He points as an example to Mr. Zuckerberg’s 2017 decision to stop Facebook Messenger from being used in Myanmar to spread calls for the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims. At the same time, United Nations investigators and human rights groups said that the company didn’t do nearly enough and, in its negligence, actively facilitated what has since been deemed a genocide.

“Mark knows that this is too much power,” Mr. Hughes writes.

Breaking up Facebook isn’t a silver bullet

Breaking up Facebook isn’t enough, as even Mr. Hughes admits, since it won’t address some of society’s greatest grievances with the platform, argues Evelyn Douek in Slate. On the issue of election security, she writes:

If we’re worried about Russia or other foreign powers using Facebook and other social media platforms to influence elections — as Sen. Elizabeth Warren mentions when making her case for breakup — then we also need to acknowledge that these influence campaigns are often sophisticated, cross-platform operations that require well-resourced, expert and coordinated responses. No one has made a good case for how breakup and competition would aid these efforts.

Ms. Douek also agrees with Mr. Hughes that Mr. Zuckerberg’s control over speech is deeply troubling. But she fails to see how increased competition would have helped in Myanmar, where the military purposefully spread violent propaganda. Authoritarianism and ethnic hatred are not problems the market can solve, nor are “the most intractable issues about how to moderate speech on any individual platform.”

User privacy, Shira Ovide argues in Bloomberg, is another issue that breaking apart the Facebook platform from Instagram and WhatsApp wouldn’t fix. She writes:

Does a core Facebook with perhaps 1 billion users have less ability to harvest information such as people’s web-surfing habits and physical locations as they roam around with smartphones? No, it doesn’t.

Both Ms. Douek and Ms. Ovide are open to breaking up Facebook to keep markets competitive, but they see trustbusting as somewhat beside the point of regulation and democratic oversight. They share this perspective with the tech journalist Kara Swisher, who has called in The Times for a national privacy law as well as increased funding for the agencies already charged with regulating the tech sector.

Dipayan Ghosh, a co-director of the Platform Accountability Project at the Harvard Kennedy School, goes one step further, claiming that Facebook should be treated as a public utility, like water and electric companies. He writes in the Harvard Business Review, “Facebook and firms like it have become natural monopolies that necessitate a novel, stringent set of regulations to obstruct their capitalistic overreaches and protect the public against ingrained economic exploitation.”

Facebook is being vilified

Reports of Facebook’s monopoly are exaggerated, writes Bloomberg’s editorial board. Dominance in a market, it says, should not be mistaken for a lack of competition:

As successful as Facebook is, there’s little stopping other companies from doing things better. In fact, they already are: Nearly all of Facebook’s constituent services — messaging, video sharing and so forth — face competition from apps around the world.

Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, has argued that the company faces a great deal of competition from Chinese tech companies, which would benefit from a policy like Ms. Warren’s. “You could break us up, you could break other tech companies up, but you actually don’t address the underlying issues people are concerned about,” she said in May.

What’s more, writes CNBC’s Matt Rosoff, calls to break up Facebook or regulate it like a public utility ignore the fact that it isn’t strictly necessary to modern life as water and electricity are:

Hughes and others have cited historical precedents such as the government’s breakup of Standard Oil and AT&T as a justification for stricter antitrust regulation against tech giants. But these companies not only had clear monopolies with pricing power that hurt consumers, they also offered products that were vital to the economy. … Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are only three of many ways people can communicate digitally, and while many people spend hours every week using them, they are replaceable and inessential.

But others worry that an older commander-in-chief would share the declines they have experienced in their own physical and mental abilities over the years.

Discussions of aging have been all-but-inescapable on the campaign trail. Since he entered the race, Mr. Biden has been dogged by questions about his physical fitness and condition — concerns he has tried to alleviate by bounding through parade routes and shaking dozens of hands in steamy summer weather. Mr. Sanders keeps a blistering campaign schedule that often includes multiple events in multiple cities each day. And supporters of Ms. Warren gush about her vitality, bragging about the hundreds of selfies she takes with supporters after each appearance.

“I was just amazed that when you first came out here, Senator Warren, that you ran up those steps the way that you did, and all this energy and stamina that you have,” Nikita L. Jackson, a Rock Hill, S.C., city councilwoman , said as she praised Ms. Warren to a crowd at a town hall event on Saturday.

None of the Democratic candidates have been particularly eager to delve into the details of their health. Aides to Mr. Sanders released a brief statement noting that he “was found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted,” a fairly common procedure in the United States. Like his rivals, Mr. Sanders has not yet released his medical records, though all three have vowed to do so before the Iowa caucuses in February.

With little actual medical information, even minor irregularities in how candidates appear have prompted a flurry of age-related speculation. When Mr. Sanders hit his head on the edge of a glass shower door, his campaign explained that he had received a cut requiring stitches but stressed that he did not fall. Mr. Biden appeared to be moving his mouth in a strange fashion during the last debate, which led to questions about whether he wore dentures. At Mr. Biden’s campaign events, voters question whether his verbal missteps can be attributed to his age.

“He’s not as sharp as he might be,” said Carol Sobelson, 63, at a campaign event in Concord, N.H. “He’s done a lot for our country, he was a great vice president. He’s probably not my first choice.”"

A Monmouth University national poll released Wednesday showed Mr. Biden locked in a statistical dead heat with Ms. Warren, who garnered 28 percent support from Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters to his 25 percent, a difference within the survey’s margin of error.

At Wednesday night’s rally, Mr. Biden took a swipe at some of his Democratic opponents who had accused him of focusing too much on Mr. Trump and not enough on issues facing voters.

“A lot of my opponents say we have to do more than just beat Donald Trump,” he said. “I agree. We have to do more than beat Donald Trump. We have to beat him like a drum.”

Mr. Biden’s team has been alarmed by reports that Mr. Trump’s supporters plan to launch an aggressive advertising campaign to portray the former vice president as the person who had acted improperly — despite the lack of any evidence to support that claim."

First, they’re based on a premise that the American economy is doing just fine and we shouldn’t mess with success. But as the statistics above make clear, the economy is not doing fine. The country should be looking for new approaches.

Second, while it’s plausible that a wealth tax might further depress economic growth, it’s also plausible that a wealth tax would accelerate economic growth. Somehow, the opponents leave out that part.

How would it accelerate growth? Right now, the American economy is suffering from extreme inequality. A large portion of society’s resources are held by a tiny slice of people, who aren’t using the resources very efficiently. As my colleague Paul Krugman wrote this week, referring to Warren’s plans, “The only people who would be directly affected by her tax proposals are those who more or less literally have more money than they know what to do with.”

Sure, it’s theoretically possible that some entrepreneurs and investors might work less hard because of a 2 percent annual tax on their holdings above $50 million (the tax threshold under the Warren plan), thus sapping economic growth. But it’s more likely that any such effect would be small — and more than outweighed by the return that the economy would get on the programs that a wealth tax would finance, like education, scientific research, infrastructure and more. Those basic investments all have a long record of lifting economic growth. The very wealthy, however, don’t tend to spend much of their money building roads, starting community colleges or financing clean energy.

So don’t be fooled by the scaremongering. A wealth tax would have a significant effect on the economy’s distribution but probably only a modest effect on the growth rate. And if anything, the tax is likely to be pro-growth."

Mr. Zuckerberg’s frank words were not meant for public consumption.

Ms. Warren, the intense and substantive politician who has morphed into the Teddy Roosevelt of the digital age, is clearly top of mind for Silicon Valley’s man-boy king. From the sound of it, she really, really bugs him. Consider this stemwinder from Mr. Zuckerberg, someone who usually is at a loss for words:

So there might be a political movement where people are angry at the tech companies or are worried about concentration or worried about different issues and worried that they’re not being handled well. That doesn’t mean that, even if there’s anger and that you have someone like Elizabeth Warren who thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies … I mean, if she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don’t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. I mean, that’s not the position that you want to be in when you’re, you know, I mean … it’s like, we care about our country and want to work with our government and do good things.

Ms. Warren’s campaign said on Friday that it had received 943,000 donations in the third quarter from 509,000 donors, and more than 300,000 of those donors gave to her presidential campaign for the first time. The average donation was $26, and Ms. Warren ended the quarter with $25.7 million in cash on hand, according to her campaign.

“Please take a moment to be proud of the movement you’re helping build ,” Roger Lau, Ms. Warren’s campaign manager, wrote in an email to supporters. “Close your eyes and picture Wall Street bankers scowling into their catered breakfast,” he suggested.

Collecting small contributions from a vast group of donors comes with a huge long-term advantage: Those donors can keep giving again and again as the campaign goes on. That is not the case for wealthy donors writing $2,800 checks to candidates — the maximum an individual can give to a campaign for the primary race.

Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders “are breaking these old political models in which rich donors can capture and control political parties,” said Stephanie Taylor, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is supporting Ms. Warren. “This is just a really revolutionary, seismic shift in American politics.”

Beating Mr. Sanders’s total for the past three months would have given another jolt of momentum to Ms. Warren’s campaign. Instead, Mr. Sanders’s status as the top fund-raiser for the quarter provides a reminder of his sizable base of support, even as other indicators like polling are less favorable.

In the long run, Mr. Sanders’s slight financial edge over Ms. Warren in the quarter is unlikely to make a major difference in the perceptions of their candidacies. Mr. Sanders entered the race having already established an enormous network of donors during his 2016 presidential campaign, and he raised slightly less in the third quarter of 2019 than he did during the same time period in 2015."

This year, the White House physician pronounced Mr. Trump in “very good health,” although the president had gained weight and is now officially obese.

Other presidents and presidential candidates have had heart trouble, though not all of it was known to the public at the time. Experts believe that President Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack that his doctor did not detect. Toward the end of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s third term and until his death in his fourth term, his White House doctor withheld the fact that he had serious heart failure. President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack near the end of his first term, and might have had a heart attack before he ran for president.

In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley damaged his presidential campaign by not disclosing that he had had a number of episodes of atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality, before he experienced one while campaigning and had to be rushed to a hospital with reporters trailing him.

Before his heart attack pulled him from the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders was polling in the top tier of the Democratic primary race with Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, and his staff has been trying to project optimism about his candidacy. But the episode has cast a shadow over his campaign just as he was attempting to reinvigorate it after a summer slump that saw his standing in some polls slip.

Hoping to reverse course, he had recently begun to focus more on his electability, arguing that he is the candidate best positioned to beat Mr. Trump in the general election.

The Sanders campaign announced this week that it had raised $25.3 million in the third quarter, placing him ahead of Ms. Warren, his chief ideological rival, by a hair and at the top of the field in fund-raising.

It’s a twist on typical family policies — like paid leave, subsidized child care or the right to work part-time — all of which make it easier for parents to have jobs outside the home. Instead, this proposal would make it easier for them not to.

It’s an idea that blurs partisan lines. On the left, there have long been calls to recognize the economic value of unpaid domestic labor by paying for it. At the same time, many on the left fear that paying at-home parents — who are most often women — would reinforce unequal gender roles and set women back in the labor force.

Thanks to a nearly $25 million fund-raising bounty in the spring, which he topped up with a respectable $19.1 million over the summer, as reported Tuesday, Mr. Buttigieg has been able to invest in a gold-plated ground game in Iowa as he seeks to challenge two candidates who have been organizing for longer here, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders .

“We’re entering the stage where the rubber meets the road,” Mr. Buttigieg said in an interview as his four-day trip wrapped up last week. “ In order to settle the question of electability , the best thing you can do is perform well in an actual election. Iowa’s of course the first. And so that’s where a lot of our focus is going to go.”

Grass-roots organizing is essential to a strong caucus finish. Word of mouth about a candidate is often what turns people out on a cold February night. The Buttigieg campaign, which opened its bus tour to live-tweeting journalists in an effort to set itself apart, is also road-testing a somewhat novel approach to organizing. Its Iowa volunteers first contact friends and family members rather than cold-calling lists of registered voters, who are now so bombarded they ignore unknown numbers."

Facebook is too powerful

The anti-monopolist spirit that animates Ms. Warren’s policy has found an unlikely vessel in Chris Hughes, who created Facebook with Mr. Zuckerberg when the two were roommates at Harvard. In a nearly 6,000-word Op-Ed for The Times, Mr. Hughes argues that Mr. Zuckerberg, whom he considers a “good, kind person,” simply has more influence over how businesses and people relate than any individual should. (Here are five takeaways from his piece.) “Mark’s power,” he says, “is unprecedented and un-American,” and must be curtailed. He writes:

Facebook has earned the prize of domination. It is worth half a trillion dollars and commands, by my estimate, more than 80 percent of the world’s social networking revenue. It is a powerful monopoly, eclipsing all of its rivals and erasing competition from the social networking category.

Mr. Hughes contends that Facebook’s dominance prohibits would-be entrepreneurs from creating alternative social networks, suffocating innovation and restricting consumer choice. The damage extends to industries beyond tech, including journalism, whose business model was broken by Facebook’s and Google’s capture of digital advertising revenue. In warning about the dangers of Facebook’s monopolistic ambitions, Mr. Hughes cites Tim Wu, a Columbia Law School professor and the author of “The Curse of Bigness,” who told Wired’s editor, Nicholas Thompson:

Mark Zuckerberg wrote an email when he was acquiring Instagram that was disclosed in the New York Post, and it suggests he was buying Instagram because he saw it as a competitive threat. Now, it is a felony under U.S. law to buy companies that you believe are competitive threats to you. … The American way is that we believe in competition and that companies should fight it out, not buy each other when there’s serious competition.

But the most pernicious aspect of Facebook’s hegemony, Mr. Hughes says, is Mr. Zuckerberg’s “unilateral control over speech.” He points as an example to Mr. Zuckerberg’s 2017 decision to stop Facebook Messenger from being used in Myanmar to spread calls for the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims. At the same time, United Nations investigators and human rights groups said that the company didn’t do nearly enough and, in its negligence, actively facilitated what has since been deemed a genocide.

“Mark knows that this is too much power,” Mr. Hughes writes.

Breaking up Facebook isn’t a silver bullet

Breaking up Facebook isn’t enough, as even Mr. Hughes admits, since it won’t address some of society’s greatest grievances with the platform, argues Evelyn Douek in Slate. On the issue of election security, she writes:

If we’re worried about Russia or other foreign powers using Facebook and other social media platforms to influence elections — as Sen. Elizabeth Warren mentions when making her case for breakup — then we also need to acknowledge that these influence campaigns are often sophisticated, cross-platform operations that require well-resourced, expert and coordinated responses. No one has made a good case for how breakup and competition would aid these efforts.

Ms. Douek also agrees with Mr. Hughes that Mr. Zuckerberg’s control over speech is deeply troubling. But she fails to see how increased competition would have helped in Myanmar, where the military purposefully spread violent propaganda. Authoritarianism and ethnic hatred are not problems the market can solve, nor are “the most intractable issues about how to moderate speech on any individual platform.”

User privacy, Shira Ovide argues in Bloomberg, is another issue that breaking apart the Facebook platform from Instagram and WhatsApp wouldn’t fix. She writes:

Does a core Facebook with perhaps 1 billion users have less ability to harvest information such as people’s web-surfing habits and physical locations as they roam around with smartphones? No, it doesn’t.

Both Ms. Douek and Ms. Ovide are open to breaking up Facebook to keep markets competitive, but they see trustbusting as somewhat beside the point of regulation and democratic oversight. They share this perspective with the tech journalist Kara Swisher, who has called in The Times for a national privacy law as well as increased funding for the agencies already charged with regulating the tech sector.

Dipayan Ghosh, a co-director of the Platform Accountability Project at the Harvard Kennedy School, goes one step further, claiming that Facebook should be treated as a public utility, like water and electric companies. He writes in the Harvard Business Review, “Facebook and firms like it have become natural monopolies that necessitate a novel, stringent set of regulations to obstruct their capitalistic overreaches and protect the public against ingrained economic exploitation.”

Facebook is being vilified

Reports of Facebook’s monopoly are exaggerated, writes Bloomberg’s editorial board. Dominance in a market, it says, should not be mistaken for a lack of competition:

As successful as Facebook is, there’s little stopping other companies from doing things better. In fact, they already are: Nearly all of Facebook’s constituent services — messaging, video sharing and so forth — face competition from apps around the world.

Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, has argued that the company faces a great deal of competition from Chinese tech companies, which would benefit from a policy like Ms. Warren’s. “You could break us up, you could break other tech companies up, but you actually don’t address the underlying issues people are concerned about,” she said in May.

What’s more, writes CNBC’s Matt Rosoff, calls to break up Facebook or regulate it like a public utility ignore the fact that it isn’t strictly necessary to modern life as water and electricity are:

Hughes and others have cited historical precedents such as the government’s breakup of Standard Oil and AT&T as a justification for stricter antitrust regulation against tech giants. But these companies not only had clear monopolies with pricing power that hurt consumers, they also offered products that were vital to the economy. … Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are only three of many ways people can communicate digitally, and while many people spend hours every week using them, they are replaceable and inessential.

In the end, writes Jim Geraghty for National Review, the fault is not in our tech overlords, but in ourselves:"

But others worry that an older commander-in-chief would share the declines they have experienced in their own physical and mental abilities over the years.

Discussions of aging have been all-but-inescapable on the campaign trail. Since he entered the race, Mr. Biden has been dogged by questions about his physical fitness and condition — concerns he has tried to alleviate by bounding through parade routes and shaking dozens of hands in steamy summer weather. Mr. Sanders keeps a blistering campaign schedule that often includes multiple events in multiple cities each day. And supporters of Ms. Warren gush about her vitality, bragging about the hundreds of selfies she takes with supporters after each appearance.

“I was just amazed that when you first came out here, Senator Warren, that you ran up those steps the way that you did, and all this energy and stamina that you have,” Nikita L. Jackson, a Rock Hill, S.C., city councilwoman , said as she praised Ms. Warren to a crowd at a town hall event on Saturday.

None of the Democratic candidates have been particularly eager to delve into the details of their health. Aides to Mr. Sanders released a brief statement noting that he “was found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted,” a fairly common procedure in the United States. Like his rivals, Mr. Sanders has not yet released his medical records, though all three have vowed to do so before the Iowa caucuses in February.

With little actual medical information, even minor irregularities in how candidates appear have prompted a flurry of age-related speculation. When Mr. Sanders hit his head on the edge of a glass shower door, his campaign explained that he had received a cut requiring stitches but stressed that he did not fall. Mr. Biden appeared to be moving his mouth in a strange fashion during the last debate, which led to questions about whether he wore dentures. At Mr. Biden’s campaign events, voters question whether his verbal missteps can be attributed to his age.

“He’s not as sharp as he might be,” said Carol Sobelson, 63, at a campaign event in Concord, N.H. “He’s done a lot for our country, he was a great vice president. He’s probably not my first choice.”"

A Monmouth University national poll released Wednesday showed Mr. Biden locked in a statistical dead heat with Ms. Warren, who garnered 28 percent support from Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters to his 25 percent, a difference within the survey’s margin of error.

At Wednesday night’s rally, Mr. Biden took a swipe at some of his Democratic opponents who had accused him of focusing too much on Mr. Trump and not enough on issues facing voters.

“A lot of my opponents say we have to do more than just beat Donald Trump,” he said. “I agree. We have to do more than beat Donald Trump. We have to beat him like a drum.”

Mr. Biden’s team has been alarmed by reports that Mr. Trump’s supporters plan to launch an aggressive advertising campaign to portray the former vice president as the person who had acted improperly — despite the lack of any evidence to support that claim."

Ms. Warren’s campaign said on Friday that it had received 943,000 donations in the third quarter from 509,000 donors, and more than 300,000 of those donors gave to her presidential campaign for the first time. The average donation was $26, and Ms. Warren ended the quarter with $25.7 million in cash on hand, according to her campaign.

“Please take a moment to be proud of the movement you’re helping build ,” Roger Lau, Ms. Warren’s campaign manager, wrote in an email to supporters. “Close your eyes and picture Wall Street bankers scowling into their catered breakfast,” he suggested.

Collecting small contributions from a vast group of donors comes with a huge long-term advantage: Those donors can keep giving again and again as the campaign goes on. That is not the case for wealthy donors writing $2,800 checks to candidates — the maximum an individual can give to a campaign for the primary race.

Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders “are breaking these old political models in which rich donors can capture and control political parties,” said Stephanie Taylor, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is supporting Ms. Warren. “This is just a really revolutionary, seismic shift in American politics.”

Beating Mr. Sanders’s total for the past three months would have given another jolt of momentum to Ms. Warren’s campaign. Instead, Mr. Sanders’s status as the top fund-raiser for the quarter provides a reminder of his sizable base of support, even as other indicators like polling are less favorable.

In the long run, Mr. Sanders’s slight financial edge over Ms. Warren in the quarter is unlikely to make a major difference in the perceptions of their candidacies. Mr. Sanders entered the race having already established an enormous network of donors during his 2016 presidential campaign, and he raised slightly less in the third quarter of 2019 than he did during the same time period in 2015."

This year, the White House physician pronounced Mr. Trump in “very good health,” although the president had gained weight and is now officially obese.

Other presidents and presidential candidates have had heart trouble, though not all of it was known to the public at the time. Experts believe that President Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack that his doctor did not detect. Toward the end of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s third term and until his death in his fourth term, his White House doctor withheld the fact that he had serious heart failure. President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack near the end of his first term, and might have had a heart attack before he ran for president.

In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley damaged his presidential campaign by not disclosing that he had had a number of episodes of atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality, before he experienced one while campaigning and had to be rushed to a hospital with reporters trailing him.

Before his heart attack pulled him from the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders was polling in the top tier of the Democratic primary race with Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, and his staff has been trying to project optimism about his candidacy. But the episode has cast a shadow over his campaign just as he was attempting to reinvigorate it after a summer slump that saw his standing in some polls slip.

Hoping to reverse course, he had recently begun to focus more on his electability, arguing that he is the candidate best positioned to beat Mr. Trump in the general election.

The Sanders campaign announced this week that it had raised $25.3 million in the third quarter, placing him ahead of Ms. Warren, his chief ideological rival, by a hair and at the top of the field in fund-raising.

Like those earlier candidates, Ms. Warren faces multiple rivals who may splinter the electorate this winter, and running up the vote margin in predominantly black areas could once again deliver troves of delegates needed for the nomination.

While Ms. Warren is rising in polls thanks to support among liberals, women, young people and college-educated whites, black voters, who are the most essential part of the traditional Democratic coalition, have yet to embrace her in large numbers."

“Let’s have some real talk,” Ms. Harris said in Reno. “This is not a new conversation for me. This is a conversation that I’ve heard every time I’ve ran a campaign and — here’s the operative word — won.”

In strategic terms, her campaign’s choice to pivot to Iowa is a concession that its initial theory of the presidential race was at least partially incorrect. From the start, her longtime advisers mapped out a national strategy that highlighted primaries with more diverse electorates — such as South Carolina, Nevada and California, her home state — while conserving resources often used in early states for television advertisements in later ones.

It was a risky bet made with California confidence, that they would not only boost a candidate with the potential to make history but also do so without prioritizing Iowa and New Hampshire, a strategy that is unproven on the national stage and a break from Barack Obama’s successful playbook in 2008.

But after the fleeting high of Ms. Harris’s much-talked-about exchange with Mr. Biden over segregation and school busing in the first Democratic debate, it became clear that several assumptions underpinning that national strategy were not in line with the current moment.

Mr. Biden’s support soon bounced back, fueled by perceptions that he was best suited to defeat Mr. Trump, which remains the obsessive top priority for most Democratic voters. Mr. Biden’s strength with black voters has been particularly difficult for Ms. Harris to match, and some of her own supporters from within the Congressional Black Caucus told her privately they felt the debate moment had crossed a line.

Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have also dictated the policy terms of the primary and the debates, pulling Ms. Harris between the dueling worlds of progressives advocating structural change and Mr. Biden’s yesteryear centrism. She prefers neither."

Denise Bauer, a former ambassador to Belgium, said there was an urgency in the air. “We need him to get the nomination because he’s the one who can win,” she said, adding “We are all going to try to raise every single dollar we can.”

Some donors played down the importance of the very currency that had brought them to Philadelphia in the first place for what the campaign called a “finance committee forum,” questioning, for instance, whether Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders had the other political assets needed to seriously challenge Mr. Biden. In a sign of the attendees’ significant financial firepower, Mr. Biden himself addressed the several dozen donors who came to the retreat on Saturday, rallying them for 45 minutes about the months ahead, people there said. The campaign kept the session with Mr. Biden behind closed doors, despite pledging to open his fund-raising events to reporters. The campaign said this event with Mr. Biden’s biggest bundlers was different because no money was actually raised.

On Friday afternoon, the donors received a tour of Mr. Biden’s downtown Philadelphia office before decamping to the second floor of The Continental Mid-town, a retro-style bar a few blocks away where they sported shiny “Joe 2020” pins and sipped from an open bar. On Saturday, there were a series of closed-door briefings, with updates from most of Mr. Biden’s top brass, including his campaign manager, Greg Schultz, and former chief of staff as vice president, Steve Ricchetti, about the run-up to the Iowa caucuses through Super Tuesday, including delegate math and digital tactics, according to attendees, who were asked to keep the proceedings private.

Recalling the difficulty Hillary Clinton had in confronting Mr. Trump’s campaign style, Mr. Biden worried about being “sucked into the trap of the stuff that Trump was laying. He wants you in a mud fight.”

“But when you respond to that,” he continued, “it brings you back down into that.”

Mr. Biden was even blunter, and angrier, in private after news first emerged that Mr. Trump had exhorted the Ukrainian government to investigate him and his son.

“I can’t believe this guy is going after my family like this,” he told Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, as the two campaigned in Iowa, Mr. Coons recalled.

“It’s time to really respond so everybody hears it,” said Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a campaign co-chairman. “If someone says something enough, people will start to believe it, and this president gets in his zone of telling a lie over and over again.

A New Gay Rights Case for a Changed Court¶

The United States Supreme Court, in its new term starting this week, will consider whether transgender and gay employees are protected under workplace discrimination laws, specifically whether discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation is considered sex discrimination under the existing federal law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In one case, Donald Zarda, a skydiving instructor, said he was fired because he was gay. “The claim could accurately be framed entirely in terms of sex and nothing else: Zarda was fired for being a man attracted to men,” his lawyers wrote. “That is sex discrimination pure and simple.” The case is the court’s first on gay rights since the retirement last year of Justice Anthony M.

Here is our quick rundown of what happened in the 2020 race.

A health scare for Sanders

Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont had a heart attack this week, and doctors inserted two stents to open a blocked artery.

Mr. Sanders, 78, was taken to a Las Vegas hospital on Wednesday after he experienced “some chest discomfort” at an event Tuesday night. His wife, Jane Sanders, later said that he was resting comfortably and that he would participate in the next Democratic debate, on Oct. 15. The news that he’d had a heart attack was not revealed until he was discharged from the hospital on Friday.

Stents are common, Dr. Lawrence K. Altman wrote. But the news of Mr. Sanders’s heart attack raised more serious questions. You can read more about that here.

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., one of the race’s leading candidates, also once faced questions about his ability to serve in public office because of a serious medical problem. In 1988, as a 45-year-old senator from Delaware , he experienced a near fatal rupture of an aneurysm in an artery in his brain . Shortly after his emergency surgery for the aneurysm, he had a second one removed before it could burst. Because new cerebral aneurysms can develop years later in a tiny percentage of individuals, some experts suggested that Mr. Biden be examined for any new aneurysms when Barack Obama selected him as his running mate. At the time, Mr. Biden’s doctor said that he did not need further testing because he had recovered fully and done well for 20 years.

Mr. Sanders is certainly not the first candidate whose presidential campaign was disrupted by a medical emergency. In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley made an unexpected visit to a hospital in the San Francisco Bay Area for atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality, which he did not disclose until after the incident. After canceling a few events, Mr. Bradley, now 76, resumed his campaign, but he eventually dropped out of the race after losing the New Hampshire primary. A poll of New Hampshire voters revealed concern about how he had handled the disclosure of his health iss ue .

Still, M r. Sanders’s case is unusual in many respects: He is a leading candidate recovering from a heart attack at age 78 who must compete in an intensely competitive primary while also holding down a demanding job as senator . Indeed, Mr. Sanders’s disruption comes amid increased pressure to bolster voter support with strong challenges from Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, and it is unclear at what pace Mr. Sanders will carry on his campaign.

“Bernie will be scrutinized very carefully in the next month or two for his ability to come back and campaign as vigorously as he has done in the 2016 and current presidential campaigns,” said Ed Rollins, a former adviser to President Ronald Reagan. “He’ll be looked at a little differently” for things like being tired at the end of the day or stumbling in his delivery onstage, Mr. Rollins added.

“I have never known a politician or big moneyed guy or anyone who has had a first heart attack” not consider his mortality, Mr. Rollins added. Also, Mr. Sanders “surely will think about a running mate.”"

He said that he paid a lower tax rate than his secretary, thanks to the many loopholes and deductions that benefit the wealthy.

His claim sparked a debate about the fairness of the tax system. In the end, the expert consensus was that, whatever Buffett’s specific situation, most wealthy Americans did not actually pay a lower tax rate than the middle class. “Is it the norm?” the fact-checking outfit Politifact asked. “No.”

Time for an update: It’s the norm now.

For the first time on record, the 400 wealthiest Americans last year paid a lower total tax rate — spanning federal, state and local taxes — than any other income group, according to newly released data.





That’s a sharp change from the 1950s and 1960s, when the wealthy paid vastly higher tax rates than the middle class or poor. Since then, taxes that hit the wealthiest the hardest — like the estate tax and corporate tax — have plummeted, while tax avoidance has become more common. President Trump’s 2017 tax cut, which was largely a handout to the rich, plays a role, too. It helped push the tax rate on the 400 wealthiest households below the rates for almost everyone else.

The overall tax rate on the richest 400 households last year was only 23 percent, meaning that their combined tax payments equaled less than one quarter of their total income. This overall rate was 70 percent in 1950 and 47 percent in 1980.

For middle-class and poor families, the picture is different. Federal income taxes have also declined modestly for these families, but they haven’t benefited much if at all from the decline in the corporate tax or estate tax. And they now pay more in payroll taxes (which finance Medicare and Social Security) than in the past. Over all, their taxes have remained fairly flat.

The combined result is that over the last 75 years the United States tax system has become radically less progressive.

The data here come from the most important book on government policy that I’ve read in a long time — called “The Triumph of Injustice,” to be released next week. The authors are Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, both professors at the University of California, Berkeley, who have done pathbreaking work on taxes. Saez has won the award that goes to the top academic economist under age 40, and Zucman was recently profiled on the cover of Bloomberg BusinessWeek magazine as “the wealth detective.”

They have constructed a historical database that tracks the tax payments of households at different points along the income spectrum going back to 1913, when the federal income tax began. The story they tell is maddening — and yet ultimately energizing.

“Many people have the view that nothing can be done,” Zucman told me. “Our case is, ‘No, that’s wrong. Look at history.’” As they write in the book: “Societies can choose whatever level of tax progressivity they want.” When the United States has raised tax rates on the wealthy and made rigorous efforts to collect those taxes, it has succeeded in doing so.

And it can succeed again.

Saez and Zucman portray the history of American taxes as a struggle between people who want to tax the rich and those who want to protect the fortunes of the rich. The story starts in the 17th century, when Northern colonies created more progressive tax systems than Europe had. Massachusetts even enacted a wealth tax, which covered financial holdings, land, ships, jewelry, livestock and more.

The Southern colonies, by contrast, were hostile to taxation. Plantation owners worried that taxes could undermine slavery by eroding the wealth of shareholders, as the historian Robin Einhorn has explained, and made sure to keep tax rates low and tax collection ineffective. (The Confederacy’s hostility to taxes ultimately hampered its ability to raise money and fight the Civil War.)

By the middle of the 20th century, the high-tax advocates had prevailed. The United States had arguably the world’s most progressive tax code, with a top income-tax rate of 91 percent and a corporate tax rate above 50 percent.

But the second half of the 20th century was mostly a victory for the low-tax side. Companies found ways to take more deductions and dodge taxes. Politicians cut every tax that fell heavily on the wealthy: high-end income taxes, investment taxes, the estate tax and the corporate tax. The justification for doing so was usually that the economy as a whole would benefit.

The justification turned out to be wrong. The wealthy, and only the wealthy, have done fantastically well over the last several decades. G.D.P. growth has been disappointing, and middle-class income growth even worse.

The American economy just doesn’t function very well when tax rates on the rich are low and inequality is sky high. It was true in the lead-up to the Great Depression, and it’s been true recently. Which means that raising high-end taxes isn’t about punishing the rich (who, by the way, will still be rich). It’s about creating an economy that works better for the vast majority of Americans.

In their book, Saez and Zucman sketch out a modern progressive tax code. The overall tax rate on the richest 1 percent would roughly double, to about 60 percent. The tax increases would bring in about $750 billion a year, or 4 percent of G.D.P., enough to pay for universal pre-K, an infrastructure program, medical research, clean energy and more. Those are the kinds of policies that do lift economic growth.

One crucial part of the agenda is a minimum global corporate tax of at least 25 percent. A company would have to pay the tax on its profits in the United States even if it set up headquarters in Ireland or Bermuda. Saez and Zucman also favor a wealth tax; Elizabeth Warren’s version is based on their work. And they call for the creation of a Public Protection Bureau, to help the I.R.S. crack down on tax dodging.

I already know what some critics will say about these arguments — that the rich will always figure out a way to avoid taxes. That’s simply not the case. True, they will always manage to avoid some taxes. But history shows that serious attempts to collect more taxes usually succeed.

Ask yourself this: If efforts to tax the super-rich were really doomed to fail, why would so many of the super-rich be fighting so hard to defeat those efforts?"

In 1974, the Supreme Court ruled some of these policies unconstitutional. But not all such policies were explicitly written down and tracked, giving many female teachers little legal recourse.

CBS News quoted a retired teacher from Ms. Warren’s school, Trudy Randall, who suggested Ms. Warren would have been unwelcome at the school given her pregnancy.

“The rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant. Now, if you didn’t tell anybody you were pregnant, and they didn’t know, you could fudge it and try to stay on a little bit longer,” Ms. Randall was quoted as saying. “But they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant.”

At issue are the circumstances that brought to an end Ms. Warren’s brief career as a special needs teacher at an elementary school in Riverdale, N.J., where she worked from 1970 to 1971, when she was just out of college. On the campaign trail, Ms. Warren’s personal story is a central part of her stump speech, beginning with her upbringing in Oklahoma and, eventually, her experience as a teacher. As Ms. Warren tells it, she had wanted to be a teacher since she was in second grade.

“I loved that work, and I would probably still be doing that work today, but my story has some more turns,” she told a crowd in Nevada last week. “By the end of the first year, I was visibly pregnant, and the principal did what principals did in those days: wished me luck and hired someone else for the job.”

She included a similar account in her 2014 memoir. In some retellings earlier this year , she said the principal “showed me the door.”"

Biden Jr., whose policy positions are generally more moderate. Ms. Warren has risen steadily in many polls while both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have lost some ground, particularly in surveys of Iowa voters, who will hold the first nominating contest in February.

Pollsters said on Tuesday that it was too soon to determine or measure the impact of Mr. Sanders’s health issues on voter preferences in the race, but they noted that his admission about his health would create a new challenge for Mr. Sanders, who, at 78, would be the oldest president ever elected by far.

​“This will just raise the issue of his age​, which to me has always been the Achilles’ heel of the Sanders campaign,” said Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which polls public opinion in the key primary state. “When Sanders ran for president in 2016, he was the not-Hillary Clinton candidate and no one paid attention to how old he is. Now, there will be a lot of attention to how old he is, and how old Joe Biden is.”

Mr. Biden is 76, while Ms. Warren is 70. President Trump is 73.

Speaking to reporters outside his home in Burlington Tuesday, Mr. Sanders gave no indication that he was planning to drop out of the race and said he would continue to campaign actively. Indeed, Mr. Sanders remains formidable: He reported a third-quarter fund-raising total of $25.3 million, the largest in the Democratic field, and he has helped steer many in the party to embrace ideas like “Medicare for all” and tuition-free public colleges.

Mr. Sanders has been campaigning almost nonstop when not carrying out his Senate duties in Washington, D.C., a pace that he pointedly noted on Tuesday."

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., one of the race’s leading candidates, also once faced questions about his ability to serve in public office because of a serious medical problem. In 1988, as a 45-year-old senator from Delaware , he experienced a near fatal rupture of an aneurysm in an artery in his brain . Shortly after his emergency surgery for the aneurysm, he had a second one removed before it could burst. Because new cerebral aneurysms can develop years later in a tiny percentage of individuals, some experts suggested that Mr. Biden be examined for any new aneurysms when Barack Obama selected him as his running mate. At the time, Mr. Biden’s doctor said that he did not need further testing because he had recovered fully and done well for 20 years.

Mr. Sanders is certainly not the first candidate whose presidential campaign was disrupted by a medical emergency. In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley made an unexpected visit to a hospital in the San Francisco Bay Area for atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality, which he did not disclose until after the incident. After canceling a few events, Mr. Bradley, now 76, resumed his campaign, but he eventually dropped out of the race after losing the New Hampshire primary. A poll of New Hampshire voters revealed concern about how he had handled the disclosure of his health iss ue .

Still, M r. Sanders’s case is unusual in many respects: He is a leading candidate recovering from a heart attack at age 78 who must compete in an intensely competitive primary while also holding down a demanding job as senator . Indeed, Mr. Sanders’s disruption comes amid increased pressure to bolster voter support with strong challenges from Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, and it is unclear at what pace Mr. Sanders will carry on his campaign.

“Bernie will be scrutinized very carefully in the next month or two for his ability to come back and campaign as vigorously as he has done in the 2016 and current presidential campaigns,” said Ed Rollins, a former adviser to President Ronald Reagan. “He’ll be looked at a little differently” for things like being tired at the end of the day or stumbling in his delivery onstage, Mr. Rollins added.

“I have never known a politician or big moneyed guy or anyone who has had a first heart attack” not consider his mortality, Mr. Rollins added. Also, Mr. Sanders “surely will think about a running mate.”"

He said that he paid a lower tax rate than his secretary, thanks to the many loopholes and deductions that benefit the wealthy.

His claim sparked a debate about the fairness of the tax system. In the end, the expert consensus was that, whatever Buffett’s specific situation, most wealthy Americans did not actually pay a lower tax rate than the middle class. “Is it the norm?” the fact-checking outfit Politifact asked. “No.”

Time for an update: It’s the norm now.

For the first time on record, the 400 wealthiest Americans last year paid a lower total tax rate — spanning federal, state and local taxes — than any other income group, according to newly released data.





That’s a sharp change from the 1950s and 1960s, when the wealthy paid vastly higher tax rates than the middle class or poor. Since then, taxes that hit the wealthiest the hardest — like the estate tax and corporate tax — have plummeted, while tax avoidance has become more common. President Trump’s 2017 tax cut, which was largely a handout to the rich, plays a role, too. It helped push the tax rate on the 400 wealthiest households below the rates for almost everyone else.

The overall tax rate on the richest 400 households last year was only 23 percent, meaning that their combined tax payments equaled less than one quarter of their total income. This overall rate was 70 percent in 1950 and 47 percent in 1980.

For middle-class and poor families, the picture is different. Federal income taxes have also declined modestly for these families, but they haven’t benefited much if at all from the decline in the corporate tax or estate tax. And they now pay more in payroll taxes (which finance Medicare and Social Security) than in the past. Over all, their taxes have remained fairly flat.

The combined result is that over the last 75 years the United States tax system has become radically less progressive.

The data here come from the most important book on government policy that I’ve read in a long time — called “The Triumph of Injustice,” to be released next week. The authors are Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, both professors at the University of California, Berkeley, who have done pathbreaking work on taxes. Saez has won the award that goes to the top academic economist under age 40, and Zucman was recently profiled on the cover of Bloomberg BusinessWeek magazine as “the wealth detective.”

They have constructed a historical database that tracks the tax payments of households at different points along the income spectrum going back to 1913, when the federal income tax began. The story they tell is maddening — and yet ultimately energizing.

“Many people have the view that nothing can be done,” Zucman told me. “Our case is, ‘No, that’s wrong. Look at history.’” As they write in the book: “Societies can choose whatever level of tax progressivity they want.” When the United States has raised tax rates on the wealthy and made rigorous efforts to collect those taxes, it has succeeded in doing so.

And it can succeed again.

Saez and Zucman portray the history of American taxes as a struggle between people who want to tax the rich and those who want to protect the fortunes of the rich. The story starts in the 17th century, when Northern colonies created more progressive tax systems than Europe had. Massachusetts even enacted a wealth tax, which covered financial holdings, land, ships, jewelry, livestock and more.

The Southern colonies, by contrast, were hostile to taxation. Plantation owners worried that taxes could undermine slavery by eroding the wealth of shareholders, as the historian Robin Einhorn has explained, and made sure to keep tax rates low and tax collection ineffective. (The Confederacy’s hostility to taxes ultimately hampered its ability to raise money and fight the Civil War.)

By the middle of the 20th century, the high-tax advocates had prevailed. The United States had arguably the world’s most progressive tax code, with a top income-tax rate of 91 percent and a corporate tax rate above 50 percent.

But the second half of the 20th century was mostly a victory for the low-tax side. Companies found ways to take more deductions and dodge taxes. Politicians cut every tax that fell heavily on the wealthy: high-end income taxes, investment taxes, the estate tax and the corporate tax. The justification for doing so was usually that the economy as a whole would benefit.

The justification turned out to be wrong. The wealthy, and only the wealthy, have done fantastically well over the last several decades. G.D.P. growth has been disappointing, and middle-class income growth even worse.

The American economy just doesn’t function very well when tax rates on the rich are low and inequality is sky high. It was true in the lead-up to the Great Depression, and it’s been true recently. Which means that raising high-end taxes isn’t about punishing the rich (who, by the way, will still be rich). It’s about creating an economy that works better for the vast majority of Americans.

In their book, Saez and Zucman sketch out a modern progressive tax code. The overall tax rate on the richest 1 percent would roughly double, to about 60 percent. The tax increases would bring in about $750 billion a year, or 4 percent of G.D.P., enough to pay for universal pre-K, an infrastructure program, medical research, clean energy and more. Those are the kinds of policies that do lift economic growth.

One crucial part of the agenda is a minimum global corporate tax of at least 25 percent. A company would have to pay the tax on its profits in the United States even if it set up headquarters in Ireland or Bermuda. Saez and Zucman also favor a wealth tax; Elizabeth Warren’s version is based on their work. And they call for the creation of a Public Protection Bureau, to help the I.R.S. crack down on tax dodging.

I already know what some critics will say about these arguments — that the rich will always figure out a way to avoid taxes. That’s simply not the case. True, they will always manage to avoid some taxes. But history shows that serious attempts to collect more taxes usually succeed.

Electric Scooters: Israel’s Two-Wheeled Solution to Traffic and Sabbath

Electric-scooter rental companies are hitting speed bumps in the U.S. over safety and other concerns. But in Tel Aviv, one in 10 residents has rented a Bird e-scooter, and the city appears to be embracing them. WSJ’s Jason Bellini takes a look at the challenges and potential lessons of the e-scooter craze."

In 1974, the Supreme Court ruled some of these policies unconstitutional. But not all such policies were explicitly written down and tracked, giving many female teachers little legal recourse.

CBS News quoted a retired teacher from Ms. Warren’s school, Trudy Randall, who suggested Ms. Warren would have been unwelcome at the school given her pregnancy.

“The rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant. Now, if you didn’t tell anybody you were pregnant, and they didn’t know, you could fudge it and try to stay on a little bit longer,” Ms. Randall was quoted as saying. “But they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant.”

At issue are the circumstances that brought to an end Ms. Warren’s brief career as a special needs teacher at an elementary school in Riverdale, N.J., where she worked from 1970 to 1971, when she was just out of college. On the campaign trail, Ms. Warren’s personal story is a central part of her stump speech, beginning with her upbringing in Oklahoma and, eventually, her experience as a teacher. As Ms. Warren tells it, she had wanted to be a teacher since she was in second grade.

“I loved that work, and I would probably still be doing that work today, but my story has some more turns,” she told a crowd in Nevada last week. “By the end of the first year, I was visibly pregnant, and the principal did what principals did in those days: wished me luck and hired someone else for the job.”

She included a similar account in her 2014 memoir. In some retellings earlier this year , she said the principal “showed me the door.”"

Biden Jr., whose policy positions are generally more moderate. Ms. Warren has risen steadily in many polls while both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have lost some ground, particularly in surveys of Iowa voters, who will hold the first nominating contest in February.

Pollsters said on Tuesday that it was too soon to determine or measure the impact of Mr. Sanders’s health issues on voter preferences in the race, but they noted that his admission about his health would create a new challenge for Mr. Sanders, who, at 78, would be the oldest president ever elected by far.

​“This will just raise the issue of his age​, which to me has always been the Achilles’ heel of the Sanders campaign,” said Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which polls public opinion in the key primary state. “When Sanders ran for president in 2016, he was the not-Hillary Clinton candidate and no one paid attention to how old he is. Now, there will be a lot of attention to how old he is, and how old Joe Biden is.”

Mr. Biden is 76, while Ms. Warren is 70. President Trump is 73.

Speaking to reporters outside his home in Burlington Tuesday, Mr. Sanders gave no indication that he was planning to drop out of the race and said he would continue to campaign actively. Indeed, Mr. Sanders remains formidable: He reported a third-quarter fund-raising total of $25.3 million, the largest in the Democratic field, and he has helped steer many in the party to embrace ideas like “Medicare for all” and tuition-free public colleges.

Mr. Sanders has been campaigning almost nonstop when not carrying out his Senate duties in Washington, D.C., a pace that he pointedly noted on Tuesday."

Your political operation takes over the D.N.C. You cannot divorce in any way fund-raising for the presidential campaign and the Democratic Party.”

The donation limits for the D.N.C. are actually far higher than those for direct contributions to campaigns. The D.N.C. can raise money in increments of $355,000; direct donations to a potential Warren general election committee would be limited to $2,800.

Ms. Orthman said Ms. Warren would attend D.N.C. events that are open to the press to “make sure the Democratic National Committee, state and local parties, and Democratic candidates everywhere have the resources” they need. She also said Ms. Warren was “not going to change a thing in how she runs her campaign,” including “no special access or call time with rich donors or big-dollar fund-raisers.”

Ms. Warren headlined a D.N.C. event in August, but she did not meet privately with large donors who attended. She is scheduled for another D.N.C. event next week.

The Warren campaign declined to say whether it would create a joint fund-raising committee with the D.N.C., which is traditionally a big lure for contributors who want to support candidates up and down the ballot. Mr. Trump and his shared committees with the Republican National Committee raised $125 million in the last three months.

Henry R. Munoz III, who stepped down as finance chair of the D.N.C. earlier this year and has co-hosted a fund-raiser for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said Ms. Warren’s proposed arrangement left him confused.

“I don’t even know how that would work,” Mr. Munoz said. Democrats, he added, “have to do everything in their power to work together to create an infrastructure to do battle with the almost unlimited resources that this administration and that party will use to destroy what we believe in.”"

It’s: Are we going to bring out what is better in us versus what is worse in us?”

He constantly plies this theme, which deserves constant plying. For him it’s clearly more than cant, and has roots in his stint in the military, which throws diverse Americans together, endowing them with a shared purpose.

He routinely steers clear of extremes — on health care, on guns, on environmental issues — not because he lacks conviction or courage, at least not from where I’m sitting, but because extremes aren’t where the most progress is usually made or where healing is likeliest to happen. He’s a champion of the sensible. In that way, he seems much older than his age.

But, ugh, that age. My wish for a young candidate didn’t mean a 37-year-old one. There’s much wisdom in this life that’s accrued only with the passage of years, and he’d be better off — and significantly less vulnerable in a general election — if he had even five more of them.

In 2016, I visited and spent many hours with him in South Bend, then wrote a column with the headline “The First Gay President?” I was looking at least a decade into the future, after he’d extended his résumé beyond South Bend, which has only about 100,000 people.

I’d be a lot more comfortable if there were an additional zero in that population figure, if he had a better record on race, and if there weren’t quite so many elitist mile markers on his journey to this point.

And that’s where my depression sets in. He’s so very strong but so crucially weak — which is the story of the Democratic primary, whose leading candidates are all agonizingly unsafe bets. Without a nanosecond’s pause, I’d vote for any of them over Trump. But will enough other Americans? The stakes are enormous and reassurance is elusive."

Extended drones, chantlike repeating phrases, tolling chords, spacious reverberation: Those are meditative sounds, defying fracture or interruption, tuning out the momentary and the trivial, invoking concentration, absorption, ritual and rapture. It’s the kind of music Nick Cave has chosen for “Ghosteen,” his 17th studio album leading the Bad Seeds.

Cave has been prolific and chameleonic since the early 1980s, when he emerged with the Birthday Party, the Australian post-punk band whose jagged songs introduced Cave’s lifelong fascination with humanity’s extremes: evil and transcendence, desire and violence, perdition and redemption, creation and annihilation. He started the Bad Seeds after the Birthday Party disbanded in 1983; since then he has written books, acted in and scored films (with the Bad Seeds’ longtime musical director, Warren Ellis) and also led a raucously collaborative band, Grinderman. His music never settled into any idiom for long.

“Ghosteen” is an eerie, somber monolith, a set of 11 songs that stretches over an hour and is grouped on two CDs. “The songs on the first album are the children. The songs on the second album are their parents. Ghosteen is a migrating spirit,” Cave wrote.

Throughout “Ghosteen,” the tempos are slow and slower, as songs circle through a handful of chords or hover in place while tension builds. Although the Bad Seeds still have the lineup of a rock band, on “Ghosteen” drums and guitars are almost entirely absent, replaced by the disembodied, sustained tones of synthesizers and string sections — built from Ellis’s violin — behind Cave’s brooding baritone, singing or speaking. Cave foreshadowed the approach with songs on “The Skeleton Tree” in 2016 — “Girl in Amber,” “Magneto” and “Distant Sky” — but those were interludes. This is a whole."

Despite its presence as a calming oasis, Salesforce Park faced stressful start-up challenges.

The transit center abruptly shut down shortly after opening in August last year when cracks were discovered in two steel beams. Officials hoped for a quick turnaround, but the project became mired in delays. After 10 months of inspection, analysis and repair, it finally reopened in July.

Building a park 70 feet in the air atop a transit center showed how complex it can be to piggyback green space on active infrastructure.

Michael Steel, a Republican strategist who was an adviser for former Gov. Jeb Bush’s 2016 presidential campaign, said Mr. Trump would need to “tear down” whoever is the eventual Democratic nominee in order to win re-election, given his low approval ratings.

“One of Senator Warren’s great strengths is her ability to connect her biography to her record to her plans for the future,” he said. “That gets undermined if she can’t rely on her biography as the foundation of that progression.”

All year, Ms. Warren has framed her personal story to voters as one of perseverance , focusing on her upbringing in Oklahoma, her family’s financial struggles and her winding path to an eventual career as a law professor. Voters often praise her biographical story as a powerful part of her pitch , which centers on bringing about big change to an economic and political system that she describes as rigged against ordinary people .

As part of that story, Ms. Warren tells crowds that at the end of her first year as a public-school teacher, she was “visibly pregnant” and lost her job. A retired teacher from Ms. Warren’s school in New Jersey told CBS News, “The rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant.”

Teachers in the United States were commonly pushed out of their jobs during pregnancy at the time, either through termination or the requirement of an unpaid leave of absence. Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978, which barred employers from treating pregnant women differently from other people “similar in their ability or inability to work,” but claims of discrimination persist to this day.

“These attacks on Senator Warren are absurd,” said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who dropped out of the presidential race in August. “Of course pregnancy discrimination was a serious problem in 1971, and it continues to be a widespread issue today despite a law banning it. The stories that women are sharing are real and powerful.”

Regardless, the Republican National Committee dismissed Ms. Warren’s description of losing her job, citing a 2007 interview in which she discussed her public-school teaching career but did not mention being forced out, as well as records showing that the school board had approved a contract for Ms. Warren for the next school year."

He constantly plies this theme, which deserves constant plying. For him it’s clearly more than cant, and has roots in his stint in the military, which throws diverse Americans together, endowing them with a shared purpose.

He routinely steers clear of extremes — on health care, on guns, on environmental issues — not because he lacks conviction or courage, at least not from where I’m sitting, but because extremes aren’t where the most progress is usually made or where healing is likeliest to happen. He’s a champion of the sensible. In that way, he seems much older than his age.

But, ugh, that age. My wish for a young candidate didn’t mean a 37-year-old one. There’s much wisdom in this life that’s accrued only with the passage of years, and he’d be better off — and significantly less vulnerable in a general election — if he had even five more of them.

In 2016, I visited and spent many hours with him in South Bend, then wrote a column with the headline “The First Gay President?” I was looking at least a decade into the future, after he’d extended his résumé beyond South Bend, which has only about 100,000 people.

I’d be a lot more comfortable if there were an additional zero in that population figure, if he had a better record on race, and if there weren’t quite so many elitist mile markers on his journey to this point.

And that’s where my depression sets in. He’s so very strong but so crucially weak — which is the story of the Democratic primary, whose leading candidates are all agonizingly unsafe bets. Without a nanosecond’s pause, I’d vote for any of them over Trump. But will enough other Americans? The stakes are enormous and reassurance is elusive."

Extended drones, chantlike repeating phrases, tolling chords, spacious reverberation: Those are meditative sounds, defying fracture or interruption, tuning out the momentary and the trivial, invoking concentration, absorption, ritual and rapture. It’s the kind of music Nick Cave has chosen for “Ghosteen,” his 17th studio album leading the Bad Seeds.

Cave has been prolific and chameleonic since the early 1980s, when he emerged with the Birthday Party, the Australian post-punk band whose jagged songs introduced Cave’s lifelong fascination with humanity’s extremes: evil and transcendence, desire and violence, perdition and redemption, creation and annihilation. He started the Bad Seeds after the Birthday Party disbanded in 1983; since then he has written books, acted in and scored films (with the Bad Seeds’ longtime musical director, Warren Ellis) and also led a raucously collaborative band, Grinderman. His music never settled into any idiom for long.

“Ghosteen” is an eerie, somber monolith, a set of 11 songs that stretches over an hour and is grouped on two CDs. “The songs on the first album are the children. The songs on the second album are their parents. Ghosteen is a migrating spirit,” Cave wrote.

Throughout “Ghosteen,” the tempos are slow and slower, as songs circle through a handful of chords or hover in place while tension builds. Although the Bad Seeds still have the lineup of a rock band, on “Ghosteen” drums and guitars are almost entirely absent, replaced by the disembodied, sustained tones of synthesizers and string sections — built from Ellis’s violin — behind Cave’s brooding baritone, singing or speaking. Cave foreshadowed the approach with songs on “The Skeleton Tree” in 2016 — “Girl in Amber,” “Magneto” and “Distant Sky” — but those were interludes. This is a whole."

Elizabeth Warren “s ticks by her story,” USA Today said. She “stands by account,” NBC News explained and “defends” it, according to The Wall Street Journal. CBS News put it this way: Warren “insists she was fired from a teaching job nearly 50 years ago because she was pregnant. A series of reports have questioned the story she’s been telling on the campaign trail.”

These descriptions all create an impression that Warren’s story is at least questionable and perhaps misleading. But the evidence suggests otherwise. From my reading of the stories, she has been telling the truth all along.

This mini-controversy has instead ended up highlighting problems not with Warren but with media coverage and political discourse. I see at least three:

Balance over accuracy. It is certainly true, as CBS noted, that some people have questioned Warren’s account. A story in the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative publication, did so, as did a writer for Jacobin, a socialist publication.

The current controversy stems from two separate but related events. The first revolves around leaked audio of Mark Zuckerberg speaking privately to employees at recent town hall meetings, where he called Senator Elizabeth Warren’s plans to break up Facebook an “existential” threat to the company and one he would fight. The second is a recent announcement by Facebook that it is exempting political figures from its policy forbidding spreading misinformation in advertisements (yes, politicians spreading false claims in their ads is just a part of the political conversation, according to Facebook).

Both developments have attracted the ire of Warren who, in a series of tweets this week, argued that the public has a right to know how Facebook “intends to use their influence in this election” and implied that Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook might be intentionally emboldening the Trump campaign by relaxing advertising rules. Fellow Democrats echoed the concerns: Seema Nanda, C.E.O. of the Democratic National Committee, told CNN that the social network’s ad policy “is a serious missed opportunity by Facebook.” At the same time, old fears that the company’s “I Voted” button, which has proved effective at boosting get-out-the-vote efforts, could give an outsize advantage to Mr. Trump are recirculating.

But Ms. Warren’s concerns miss a key point about the social network’s roles in elections.

Yes, Facebook’s willingness to let politicians lie sets a worrying precedent. And yes, lack of oversight into the platform’s decisions opens up a host of plausible election interference conspiracies. But Facebook’s essential threat to democracy isn’t that Mr. Zuckerberg will intervene on behalf of his preferred candidate — it’s more fundamental than that. Mark Zuckerberg need not intervene, because Facebook, the platform, will do so instinctively. With its algorithmic mandate of engagement over all else, Facebook has redefined what it means to be a good candidate — and provided a distinct natural advantage to those who distort the truth and seek to divide.

Few politicians have evidenced this phenomenon better than President Trump, the natural Facebook candidate. He’s light on policy but heavy on the sort of sweeping imagery that translates so easily to memes (some of his memes, like “The Wall,” eventually do become policy).

Deploys an Old Tactic",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-fired-teaching.html,"Mr. Trump has slurred Ms. Warren for years over her ancestry claims, and the personal attacks on her come out of the Trump playbook from 2016 that targeted both Republicans and Mrs. Clinton. Michael Steel, a Republican strategist who was an adviser for former Gov. Jeb Bush’s 2016 presidential campaign, said Mr. Trump would need to “tear down” whoever is the eventual Democratic nominee in order to win re-election, given his low approval ratings.

“One of Senator Warren’s great strengths is her ability to connect her biography to her record to her plans for the future,” he said. “That gets undermined if she can’t rely on her biography as the foundation of that progression.”

All year, Ms. Warren has framed her personal story to voters as one of perseverance , focusing on her upbringing in Oklahoma, her family’s financial struggles and her winding path to an eventual career as a law professor. Voters often praise her biographical story as a powerful part of her pitch , which centers on bringing about big change to an economic and political system that she describes as rigged against ordinary people .

As part of that story, Ms. Warren tells crowds that at the end of her first year as a public-school teacher, she was “visibly pregnant” and lost her job. A retired teacher from Ms. Warren’s school in New Jersey told CBS News, “The rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant.”

Teachers in the United States were commonly pushed out of their jobs during pregnancy at the time, either through termination or the requirement of an unpaid leave of absence. Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978, which barred employers from treating pregnant women differently from other people “similar in their ability or inability to work,” but claims of discrimination persist to this day.

“These attacks on Senator Warren are absurd,” said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who dropped out of the presidential race in August. “Of course pregnancy discrimination was a serious problem in 1971, and it continues to be a widespread issue today despite a law banning it. The stories that women are sharing are real and powerful.”

Regardless, the Republican National Committee dismissed Ms. Warren’s description of losing her job, citing a 2007 interview in which she discussed her public-school teaching career but did not mention being forced out, as well as records showing that the school board had approved a contract for Ms. Warren for the next school year."

Oct. 11, 2019

With a crucial debate looming next week in the Democratic presidential primary, the party’s populist wing appears increasingly in control of the race — rising in the polls, stocked with cash and with only a wounded leading candidate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., standing in its way.

Several slow-building trends have converged to upend the race over the last few weeks: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s steady ascent in the polls has accelerated. Both she and Senator Bernie Sanders, a fellow progressive, have raised immense sums of money from small donors online, dominating the Democratic field and each collecting about $10 million more than Mr. Biden in the last quarter. And Mr. Biden’s numbers have gradually slipped in a way that has alarmed his supporters.

The race is far from over: All three of the top candidates — Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders — have a path to victory, and there is still time for longer-shot candidates to make a real run at the nomination. The CNN/New York Times debate in Ohio on Tuesday is likely to test Ms. Warren’s status as an emerging front-runner, subjecting her to new criticism from her fellow Democrats on matters ranging from health care policy to trade and the role of the government in overseeing the economy. Above all, she may need to allay lingering reservations about her appeal to swing voters in the general election."

Business is diverting enough.

The mess at WeWork continues to simmer. Mr. Neumann stepped down as chief executive in September, but the company has had to put off its initial public offering of stock, and it continues to lose enormous sums of money.

I can hardly wait to read the book about WeWork, once somebody writes it. Disruptive companies make great reads. “Super Pumped,” the new book about Uber, the ride hailing giant, written by my colleague Mike Isaac, has become one of my favorites. He described Uber’s corporate excesses, including a private multimillion dollar Las Vegas party featuring the superstar Beyoncé, as well as numerous incidents of lawbreaking and a toxic culture for women.

Uber bid its founder, Travis Kalanick, goodbye as chief executive in 2017 (he remains on the board of directors), and it has been on a more stable management footing. But the company continues to be a money loser. In August, it posted a quarterly loss of $5.2 billion.

For a terrific read about a company that flew high, then crashed and burned in scandal, don’t miss “Bad Blood” by John Carreyrou. It is about Theranos, the blood test company, a stock market wonder not so long ago, and now, an example of enormous fraud.

Books like these have found a proud place on my virtual bookshelf (I’m an audiobook guy), and provide wholesome diversion from the political news.

There is one major problem, though: This kind of excitement makes for riveting entertainment, but it isn’t necessarily what you want in an investment portfolio. Going over Niagara Falls in a barrel is exhilarating. Compound interest is not, yet it is more likely to float you safely to retirement.

I’ll concede that a conservative approach isn’t for everyone. A handful of companies make it colossally big while taking outsize risks, and some investment firms — and individuals — get rich when these companies turn out to be world beaters."

Oct. 11, 2019

With a crucial debate looming next week in the Democratic presidential primary, the party’s populist wing appears increasingly in control of the race — rising in the polls, stocked with cash and with only a wounded leading candidate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., standing in its way.

Several slow-building trends have converged to upend the race over the last few weeks: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s steady ascent in the polls has accelerated. Both she and Senator Bernie Sanders, a fellow progressive, have raised immense sums of money from small donors online, dominating the Democratic field and each collecting about $10 million more than Mr. Biden in the last quarter. And Mr. Biden’s numbers have gradually slipped in a way that has alarmed his supporters.

The race is far from over: All three of the top candidates — Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders — have a path to victory, and there is still time for longer-shot candidates to make a real run at the nomination. The CNN/New York Times debate in Ohio on Tuesday is likely to test Ms. Warren’s status as an emerging front-runner, subjecting her to new criticism from her fellow Democrats on matters ranging from health care policy to trade and the role of the government in overseeing the economy. Above all, she may need to allay lingering reservations about her appeal to swing voters in the general election."

And yes, Mark Zuckerberg, I’m looking at you.”

For Facebook, the situation is tricky. The social media company has struggled in recent years with what to allow and disallow on its site, especially after revelations that Russian operatives used the platform during the 2016 presidential election to post disinformation to inflame the American electorate. Facebook has moved to clamp down on false content. Yet when the company removes or buries messages, ads, photos and videos, it is often called out for bias and censorship. Facebook has faced particular wrath from conservatives, who have said the social network intentionally suppresses what they say.

“Facebook believes political speech should be protected,” a spokesman for Facebook said on Saturday. “If Senator Warren wants to say things she knows to be untrue, we believe Facebook should not be in the position of censoring that speech.”

Truth in social media advertising is likely to become a bigger issue ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Mr. Zuckerberg is scheduled to speak about Facebook’s political speech policies this coming week at Georgetown University.

Presidential candidates have been spending huge sums on ads on Facebook and other social media platforms to reach voters. Some campaigns have focused on advertising specifically on Facebook given its sheer size — it has more than 2.2 billion users worldwide — and the ability to spread ads and content cheaply and quickly across the platform."

Business is diverting enough.

The mess at WeWork continues to simmer. Mr. Neumann stepped down as chief executive in September, but the company has had to put off its initial public offering of stock, and it continues to lose enormous sums of money.

I can hardly wait to read the book about WeWork, once somebody writes it. Disruptive companies make great reads. “Super Pumped,” the new book about Uber, the ride hailing giant, written by my colleague Mike Isaac, has become one of my favorites. He described Uber’s corporate excesses, including a private multimillion dollar Las Vegas party featuring the superstar Beyoncé, as well as numerous incidents of lawbreaking and a toxic culture for women.

Uber bid its founder, Travis Kalanick, goodbye as chief executive in 2017 (he remains on the board of directors), and it has been on a more stable management footing. But the company continues to be a money loser. In August, it posted a quarterly loss of $5.2 billion.

For a terrific read about a company that flew high, then crashed and burned in scandal, don’t miss “Bad Blood” by John Carreyrou. It is about Theranos, the blood test company, a stock market wonder not so long ago, and now, an example of enormous fraud.

Books like these have found a proud place on my virtual bookshelf (I’m an audiobook guy), and provide wholesome diversion from the political news.

There is one major problem, though: This kind of excitement makes for riveting entertainment, but it isn’t necessarily what you want in an investment portfolio. Going over Niagara Falls in a barrel is exhilarating. Compound interest is not, yet it is more likely to float you safely to retirement.

I’ll concede that a conservative approach isn’t for everyone. A handful of companies make it colossally big while taking outsize risks, and some investment firms — and individuals — get rich when these companies turn out to be world beaters."

For years, prospective Democratic nominees came to Iowa to talk ethanol and pork subsidies and saved any rhetoric about the injustice of racial profiling for crowds in South Carolina and Nevada — the only early voting states where black and Latino voters made up a significant portion of the Democratic electorate.

But in the era of Mr. Trump, and after social movements such as Black Lives Matter pushed racial inequality to the forefront of national politics, it’s white Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire — not black ones in South Carolina — who, to this point, are embracing the candidates who promise to upend society in the name of racial equity.

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has held a commanding lead in national polls with nonwhite Democrats, but surveys show that white liberals in Iowa and New Hampshire are less inclined to support him. At events for Mr. Biden , some white voters cite his confounding September debate answer on the legacy of slavery and previous Senate work with segregationists as reasons to support other candidates.

At events for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind. — two white candidates who have particularly excelled with college-educated liberals — supporters pointed to policies addressing racial inequalities as part of the candidates’ appeal.

These policies may give cover to those seeking to support a white candidate in a historically diverse Democratic field, which includes Ms. Harris, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, and former cabinet secretary Julián Castro — candidates who are themselves racial minorities and who are struggling to gain traction in the polls.

Ms. Warren’s surge in the polls has finally reached the point where it has become problematic for Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders. Both men have signaled that attacks could be coming, with Mr. Sanders drawing a pretty sharp contrast over the weekend.

It’s likely that some of those attacks will focus on her health care plan: how she would pay for it, whether she would raise taxes on the middle class, whether she would end private insurance plans and how she would accommodate union health plans.

Will Ms. Warren be ready with more polished answers than she has given in the past?

Whither Mayor Pete?

Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has the most field offices in the early states (tied with Ms. Warren) and a generous campaign bank account (only Mr. Sanders has raised more among Democrats). What he lacks is actual traction in the polls.

So far, most of his debate performances have been characterized by “West Wing”-style monologues. But there are signs he may pivot to a more aggressive tack Tuesday night in hopes of expanding his support. In recent weeks, he has nudged Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders on health care and has been in something of a sniper fight with former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas.

There have been plenty of signs that the two young guns in the race may be headed for a shootout at the Otterbein University Corral. The question is whether that will be enough for either to make a mark.

If his family intends to shun foreign business in the event that he becomes president — as Hunter Biden said he would on Sunday — voters may wonder why they didn’t do it far sooner, when Mr. Biden was conducting foreign diplomacy as vice president.

Perhaps most of all, anxious Democratic leaders are looking to the former vice president for a sign on the debate stage that all of this is not coming too late in this campaign to make a difference — to quash the undercurrent of doubt among some Democratic strategists, activists, donors a nd voters that Mr. Biden is really ready for a general-election fight against a president prepared to scorch and smear his way to a second term.

“I’m a little worried about how Joe’s going to do if he were to get on a debate stage with the president, a little worried he’d be able to get him rattled,” said Tom Courtney, t he co-chairman of the Des Moines County Democrats in Iowa, a state where the Biden campaign has made substantial investments. “I would like to see him quit getting bogged down in little things.

In fact, it’s a conversation that’s come up every single time in every election that I have — and here’s the operative word — won,” she said. Her largely white audience liked the pitch, responding with rapt silence and then with raucous applause when she talked candidly about her own accomplishments.

For years, prospective Democratic nominees came to Iowa to talk ethanol and pork subsidies and saved any rhetoric about the injustice of racial profiling for crowds in South Carolina and Nevada — the only early voting states where black and Latino voters made up a significant portion of the Democratic electorate.

But in the era of Mr. Trump, and after social movements such as Black Lives Matter pushed racial inequality to the forefront of national politics, it’s white Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire — not black ones in South Carolina — who, to this point, are embracing the candidates who promise to upend society in the name of racial equity.

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has held a commanding lead in national polls with nonwhite Democrats, but surveys show that white liberals in Iowa and New Hampshire are less inclined to support him. At events for Mr. Biden , some white voters cite his confounding September debate answer on the legacy of slavery and previous Senate work with segregationists as reasons to support other candidates.

At events for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind. — two white candidates who have particularly excelled with college-educated liberals — supporters pointed to policies addressing racial inequalities as part of the candidates’ appeal.

These policies may give cover to those seeking to support a white candidate in a historically diverse Democratic field, which includes Ms. Harris, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, and former cabinet secretary Julián Castro — candidates who are themselves racial minorities and who are struggling to gain traction in the polls.

“My daughter is marrying an Asian man and diversity has become very important to me,” said Julie Neff, a 57-year-old Iowa Democrat who attended the Harris rally. Ms. Neff, who is white, said she was embarrassed that she started thinking about race and discrimination only later in life."

Note: Facebook ad spending data from March 24 to Oct. 5. | Sources: Bully Pulpit Interactive; Facebook

When it comes to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s Facebook ads, the odds are overwhelming that people seeing them were born before 1975. For Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the opposite is true: People born in 1975 or after are more than twice as likely to see his Facebook ads than those born earlier. A gender split is clear, too: About half of Mr. Sanders’s audience are men, while about two-thirds of Mr. Biden’s are women.

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, more or less, splits the difference between them. She has targeted a Facebook audience that more closely mirrors the projected universe of likely Democratic primary voters in 2020: more women than men (though not by as much as Mr. Biden), leaning older more than younger (but again, not by as much as Mr. Biden).

Collectively, the 19 current Democratic candidates for president have poured nearly $32 million into Facebook ads this year — more money than they have spent so far on television ads, a striking measure of the social network's ever-rising influence in politics. The heavy spending on Facebook comes even as leading party officials have raised alarms about the site’s role in American democracy.

Ms. Warren sparred with Facebook in recent days over the company’s willingness to run false ads. She has been a heavy spender nonetheless, pouring $172,000 into the site over the seven most recent days records are available.

The advertising decisions that each campaign makes on one of the Internet’s biggest platforms offer an almost unparalleled window into their political priorities and strategies, illuminating their core supporters and providing a glimpse into their potential coalitions. The spending patterns reveal not just who the campaigns are targeting but where.

The 2020 race marks the first presidential campaign where Facebook is publicly publishing who is buying ads — and whom they are targeting. This story is based on Facebook data compiled and analyzed by Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic consultancy. Its database includes estimates of which gender and age group every candidate has targeted since March but not does not include race or ethnicity, which Facebook does not explicitly allow campaigns to use for targeted ads.

Because campaigns receive so much real-time feedback from Facebook, they are able to precisely hone their audiences.

“You can prioritize toward people taking the action you want them to take,” said Alex Kellner, a Democratic strategist at Bully Pulpit. “Facebook helps you optimize toward the outcome you want.”

Aside from Mr. Sanders and Mr. Yang, candidates are mostly reaching out to older voters.

Note: Includes only spending where gender is identified.

Among the leading candidates, Mr. Sanders targets a younger and more male audience on Facebook. That mirrors his support in polls, which regularly show him strongest among young voters, and performing better among men than women.

“There’s a reason why they’re called ‘Bernie Bros,’” said Jefrey Pollock, a Democratic pollster who formerly advised Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s campaign. “Nothing about him targeting younger men is surprising to me.”

One of the most striking findings of the Facebook advertising data is just how little Mr. Biden is spending to reach the youngest generation of voters. Less than one half of 1 percent of Mr. Biden’s Facebook ad buys have targeted users born in 1995 or later. That was the smallest share — and smallest dollar amount — that any of the 11 other candidates who will be on the debate stage Tuesday spent for any age segment.

Mr. Biden spent less than $12,000 targeting voters younger than 25 through the beginning of October. Mr. Sanders spent nearly half a million dollars targeting the same age group, according to Bully Pulpit.

Emily Williams, a Democratic digital strategist who worked on Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign, said Mr. Biden’s lack of spending on young voters was a cause for concern. “It says to me that they’re struggling to break through with younger voters,” she said, “and I hope it doesn’t mean they’ve given up on younger voters.”

Mr. Biden’s bread and butter was older women: Fifty-five percent of his entire Facebook ad budget was devoted to women 45 or older, including some ads last month about Medicare.

It makes sense that the demographic groups targeted by the leading candidates look a lot like their existing supporters, digital strategists said, because much of the advertising so far has been seeking out new donors. A campaign’s best bet is serving ads to its base.

Still, the degree to which Facebook advertising aligns with polling can be almost eerie.

In a Quinnipiac poll last week, Mr. Biden led the field by a wide margin among voters who were at least 65 years old — the same segment he tops in Facebook ad spending. In the same survey, Mr. Sanders dominated among those 18 to 34 years old — where Mr. Sanders dominates in spending. Ms. Warren came in second in the poll among both extreme ends of the age spectrum, while she led among voters 35 to 65 years old.

On Facebook, Ms. Warren’s share of spending fell in between Mr. Sanders’s and Mr. Biden’s for every age segment.

Her spending splits were closely aligned with those of Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whose spending skewed slightly younger and more male. The age and gender groups targeted by the billionaire Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July and has quickly outspent all his rivals, was similar to Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren.

“A new generation of leadership” ad from Mr. Buttigieg’s campaign targets older women. Source: Facebook

A majority of Mr. Buttigieg’s Facebook spending has gone to those aged 45 years and above, despite running as a candidate for a “new generation,” a phrase featured in some of his ads. (Mr. Buttigieg wrote in his autobiography that back in his first run for mayor as a 29-year-old, older voters were more likely to see his youth as a positive.)

Candidates’ ad spending largely skews female.

Almost all of the candidates in the debate on Tuesday are advertising to a majority-female audience on Facebook. But the campaign most lopsidedly targeting women on Facebook is not one of the four female candidates at the debate, but Julián Castro, the former federal housing secretary. Jennifer Fiore, a senior adviser to Mr. Castro, was not surprised by that fact.

She noted that Mr. Castro’s campaign manager and other top strategists are women and that Mr. Castro has made his mother a big part of his pitch, featuring her in video ads on Facebook earlier this year. (Of late, the campaign has also run Facebook ads with pictures of puppies, touting that Mr. Castro would “make animal abuse a federal crime.”)

“We’re targeting women because women are responding,” Ms. Fiore said.

That self-reinforcing truism is a feature across the platform: Operatives said that Facebook’s formulas encourage advertisers to double-down on whatever demographic groups are already clicking, driving those candidates with older bases to target ever older audiences, and vice versa.

That, for instance, is how Andrew Yang, the former tech executive, is targeting an overwhelmingly male and young audience. (Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii skews slightly more male but she is spending a fraction of what Mr. Yang is.)

“The Facebook algorithm optimizes for people who are taking action,” said Eric Ming, the director of paid media for the Yang campaign, explaining that Mr. Yang’s demographics are younger and more male because that is where his message is resonating. The ads also often feature cartoon character versions of the candidate.

Digital strategists describe three phases to online advertising in campaigns. The first is acquiring new donors and supporters. The second is persuading undecided voters. The third is getting people out to vote.

For the most part, campaigns have been focused on the first phase. But some have begun to invest in persuasion — and it’s visible in their geographic splits.

Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Steyer are dominant in the first four voting states.

Note: Data from Sept. 1 to Oct. 5. | Source: Bully Pulpit Interactive

For Senator Kamala Harris of California, her biggest states for advertising in the spring were those with the biggest populations: California, New York, Texas and Florida. But in July, she shifted. Her biggest state for Facebook advertising in each of the last three months has been Iowa, a shift made in spending priorities long before she publicly announced her “pivot” to focus on that state’s leadoff caucuses.

In September, for the first time, South Carolina jumped up to one of her biggest spending states. That month, she spent $52,000 there on Facebook, second to Mr. Steyer.

Mr. Buttigieg has been the biggest spender on Facebook nationally, besides Mr. Steyer and his virtually unlimited budget. Mr. Buttigieg’s dominance is particularly apparent in the opening states of Iowa and New Hampshire. In September, Mr. Buttigieg was the top spender in both states by a wide margin. In fact, he spent more than all his rivals, other than Mr. Steyer, combined.

As the Democrats have focused on the critical primary contests, President Trump has flooded Facebook with messaging aimed at the general election. In the last month, he spent more than $700,000 on Facebook ads just in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida — four swing states he narrowly carried in 2016.

“Danger, danger, danger!” said Betsy Hoover, who was the director of digital organizing for Mr. Obama’s re-election campaign and is unaligned in the 2020 primary.

Ms. Hoover said she worries that Democrats are “focusing on the coasts or early states — none of which matter in the general,” while Mr. Trump is delivering his message to key voters.

“We are running a primary strategy and Trump is running a general election strategy,” she said, “And that’s terrifying.”"

For many young, progressive Americans, democratic socialism is a far better representation of their ambitions of far-reaching structural change across the economy and society than the agenda of the Democratic Party, which they see as overly influenced by corporate interests, big-money donors and moderate traditionalists.

The attempt at Ohio State to define objectives also comes as the Democratic presidential contenders are locked in a battle over what direction the party should take in order to win in 2020.

So I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.”

Many Democratic strategists and officials have warned that the scrutiny on the Biden family has become a significant distraction for the former vice president, and poses perhaps the greatest threat yet to a candidacy that until recent weeks was well ahead in the polls. That makes it all the more urgent for Mr. Biden to land the kind of consistently fluent, forceful debate performance that has so far eluded him at a moment when Senator Elizabeth Warren has now surpassed him in some polls, Democratic operatives and activists said.

“I’m never a distraction to my dad, but as it relates to actually going and being onstage with him — this is not a family business,” Hunter Biden said Tuesday in the ABC interview, which aired on “Good Morning America’’ and was also excerpted online by the network. “Everybody kind of thinks that somehow, whether it’s a compliment that we’re like the Kennedys or whether it’s a, you know, backhanded compliment like you’re the Trumps, my dad has a, a job, but that does not mean that I have had any plans to go do rallies and, you know and, you know, talk about Donald Trump’s kids and I never will, you know, that’s not what Bidens do.”

At a news conference on Sunday, however, his father did appear to take some oblique swipes at the ethical practices of members of the Trump family, some of whom who have conducted their own overseas business dealings. And Hunter Biden seemed to be dismissive of Donald Trump Jr., who along with his father and brother have been highly critical of the Bidens.

“Donald Prince Humperdinck, um, Trump, Jr., is not somebody I really care about,” he said, an apparent reference to a character in the movie “The Princess Bride.”

In the interview, Hunter Biden signaled that by backing away from foreign dealings, he hoped to eliminate the controversy as a campaign issue for his father.

There is a similar lack of consensus among the Democratic candidates on whether to force all gun owners to register their weapons in a national database. Democratic politicians long dismissed the idea of a gun registry as a fear-mongering tactic from the National Rifle Association, but it now enjoys broad support from the public: 62 percent of Americans back the idea, including 85 percent of Democrats.

Most candidates now favor establishing a registry, though some — including Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. — do not. Others, like Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, say it should apply only to owners of assault weapons.

Climate Change









Democratic voters widely believe that climate change represents an international emergency — 84 percent said so in the August Quinnipiac poll — and roughly nine in 10 think the United States is not doing enough to address global warming.

All the major Democratic candidates have expressed support for the Green New Deal, though some have been more guarded than others. All five senators who will debate Tuesday night co-sponsored the bill. Mr. Buttigieg has simply called it “the right beginning,” while Mr. Biden’s campaign website endorses it as a “crucial framework.”

But the Green New Deal enjoys broad support from the American public, with 63 percent of respondents to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll in July saying they like the idea of investing government money to fund sustainable infrastructure projects and green jobs. Among Democrats, it’s a particularly winning concept; 86 percent of Democrats nationwide back the Green New Deal, the poll found."

Bret: Wavering. A few of my arguments against impeachment no longer look as good to me now as they did two weeks ago.

Gail: I can definitely imagine Buttigieg being the Democratic nominee down the road — in another four or eight or 12 years.

Note: Facebook ad spending data from March 24 to Oct. 5. | Sources: Bully Pulpit Interactive; Facebook

When it comes to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s Facebook ads, the odds are overwhelming that people seeing them were born before 1975. For Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the opposite is true: People born in 1975 or after are more than twice as likely to see his Facebook ads than those born earlier. A gender split is clear, too: About half of Mr. Sanders’s audience are men, while about two-thirds of Mr. Biden’s are women.

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, more or less, splits the difference between them. She has targeted a Facebook audience that more closely mirrors the projected universe of likely Democratic primary voters in 2020: more women than men (though not by as much as Mr. Biden), leaning older more than younger (but again, not by as much as Mr. Biden).

Collectively, the 19 current Democratic candidates for president have poured nearly $32 million into Facebook ads this year — more money than they have spent so far on television ads, a striking measure of the social network's ever-rising influence in politics. The heavy spending on Facebook comes even as leading party officials have raised alarms about the site’s role in American democracy.

Ms. Warren sparred with Facebook in recent days over the company’s willingness to run false ads. She has been a heavy spender nonetheless, pouring $172,000 into the site over the seven most recent days records are available.

The advertising decisions that each campaign makes on one of the Internet’s biggest platforms offer an almost unparalleled window into their political priorities and strategies, illuminating their core supporters and providing a glimpse into their potential coalitions. The spending patterns reveal not just who the campaigns are targeting but where.

The 2020 race marks the first presidential campaign where Facebook is publicly publishing who is buying ads — and whom they are targeting. This story is based on Facebook data compiled and analyzed by Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic consultancy. Its database includes estimates of which gender and age group every candidate has targeted since March but not does not include race or ethnicity, which Facebook does not explicitly allow campaigns to use for targeted ads.

Because campaigns receive so much real-time feedback from Facebook, they are able to precisely hone their audiences.

“You can prioritize toward people taking the action you want them to take,” said Alex Kellner, a Democratic strategist at Bully Pulpit. “Facebook helps you optimize toward the outcome you want.”

Aside from Mr. Sanders and Mr. Yang, candidates are mostly reaching out to older voters.

Note: Includes only spending where gender is identified.

Among the leading candidates, Mr. Sanders targets a younger and more male audience on Facebook. That mirrors his support in polls, which regularly show him strongest among young voters, and performing better among men than women.

“There’s a reason why they’re called ‘Bernie Bros,’” said Jefrey Pollock, a Democratic pollster who formerly advised Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s campaign. “Nothing about him targeting younger men is surprising to me.”

One of the most striking findings of the Facebook advertising data is just how little Mr. Biden is spending to reach the youngest generation of voters. Less than one half of 1 percent of Mr. Biden’s Facebook ad buys have targeted users born in 1995 or later. That was the smallest share — and smallest dollar amount — that any of the 11 other candidates who will be on the debate stage Tuesday spent for any age segment.

Mr. Biden spent less than $12,000 targeting voters younger than 25 through the beginning of October. Mr. Sanders spent nearly half a million dollars targeting the same age group, according to Bully Pulpit.

Emily Williams, a Democratic digital strategist who worked on Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign, said Mr. Biden’s lack of spending on young voters was a cause for concern. “It says to me that they’re struggling to break through with younger voters,” she said, “and I hope it doesn’t mean they’ve given up on younger voters.”

Mr. Biden’s bread and butter was older women: Fifty-five percent of his entire Facebook ad budget was devoted to women 45 or older, including some ads last month about Medicare.

It makes sense that the demographic groups targeted by the leading candidates look a lot like their existing supporters, digital strategists said, because much of the advertising so far has been seeking out new donors. A campaign’s best bet is serving ads to its base.

Still, the degree to which Facebook advertising aligns with polling can be almost eerie.

In a Quinnipiac poll last week, Mr. Biden led the field by a wide margin among voters who were at least 65 years old — the same segment he tops in Facebook ad spending. In the same survey, Mr. Sanders dominated among those 18 to 34 years old — where Mr. Sanders dominates in spending. Ms. Warren came in second in the poll among both extreme ends of the age spectrum, while she led among voters 35 to 65 years old.

On Facebook, Ms. Warren’s share of spending fell in between Mr. Sanders’s and Mr. Biden’s for every age segment.

Her spending splits were closely aligned with those of Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whose spending skewed slightly younger and more male. The age and gender groups targeted by the billionaire Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July and has quickly outspent all his rivals, was similar to Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren.

“A new generation of leadership” ad from Mr. Buttigieg’s campaign targets older women. Source: Facebook

A majority of Mr. Buttigieg’s Facebook spending has gone to those aged 45 years and above, despite running as a candidate for a “new generation,” a phrase featured in some of his ads. (Mr. Buttigieg wrote in his autobiography that back in his first run for mayor as a 29-year-old, older voters were more likely to see his youth as a positive.)

Candidates’ ad spending largely skews female.

Almost all of the candidates in the debate on Tuesday are advertising to a majority-female audience on Facebook. But the campaign most lopsidedly targeting women on Facebook is not one of the four female candidates at the debate, but Julián Castro, the former federal housing secretary. Jennifer Fiore, a senior adviser to Mr. Castro, was not surprised by that fact.

She noted that Mr. Castro’s campaign manager and other top strategists are women and that Mr. Castro has made his mother a big part of his pitch, featuring her in video ads on Facebook earlier this year. (Of late, the campaign has also run Facebook ads with pictures of puppies, touting that Mr. Castro would “make animal abuse a federal crime.”)

“We’re targeting women because women are responding,” Ms. Fiore said.

That self-reinforcing truism is a feature across the platform: Operatives said that Facebook’s formulas encourage advertisers to double-down on whatever demographic groups are already clicking, driving those candidates with older bases to target ever older audiences, and vice versa.

That, for instance, is how Andrew Yang, the former tech executive, is targeting an overwhelmingly male and young audience. (Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii skews slightly more male but she is spending a fraction of what Mr. Yang is.)

“The Facebook algorithm optimizes for people who are taking action,” said Eric Ming, the director of paid media for the Yang campaign, explaining that Mr. Yang’s demographics are younger and more male because that is where his message is resonating. The ads also often feature cartoon character versions of the candidate.

Digital strategists describe three phases to online advertising in campaigns. The first is acquiring new donors and supporters. The second is persuading undecided voters. The third is getting people out to vote.

For the most part, campaigns have been focused on the first phase. But some have begun to invest in persuasion — and it’s visible in their geographic splits.

Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Steyer are dominant in the first four voting states.

Note: Data from Sept. 1 to Oct. 5. | Source: Bully Pulpit Interactive

For Senator Kamala Harris of California, her biggest states for advertising in the spring were those with the biggest populations: California, New York, Texas and Florida. But in July, she shifted. Her biggest state for Facebook advertising in each of the last three months has been Iowa, a shift made in spending priorities long before she publicly announced her “pivot” to focus on that state’s leadoff caucuses.

In September, for the first time, South Carolina jumped up to one of her biggest spending states. That month, she spent $52,000 there on Facebook, second to Mr. Steyer.

Mr. Buttigieg has been the biggest spender on Facebook nationally, besides Mr. Steyer and his virtually unlimited budget. Mr. Buttigieg’s dominance is particularly apparent in the opening states of Iowa and New Hampshire. In September, Mr. Buttigieg was the top spender in both states by a wide margin. In fact, he spent more than all his rivals, other than Mr. Steyer, combined.

As the Democrats have focused on the critical primary contests, President Trump has flooded Facebook with messaging aimed at the general election. In the last month, he spent more than $700,000 on Facebook ads just in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida — four swing states he narrowly carried in 2016.

“Danger, danger, danger!” said Betsy Hoover, who was the director of digital organizing for Mr. Obama’s re-election campaign and is unaligned in the 2020 primary.

Ms. Hoover said she worries that Democrats are “focusing on the coasts or early states — none of which matter in the general,” while Mr. Trump is delivering his message to key voters.

“We are running a primary strategy and Trump is running a general election strategy,” she said, “And that’s terrifying.”"

Elizabeth Warren. Swing voters exist, and they are likely to decide the 2020 election, much as they played a decisive role in 2016 and 2018. So far, Warren has not worried much about appealing to them. Now that she’s the front-runner, can she begin to signal to Democrats that she wants to be ruthless about beating President Trump?

Joe Biden. He has yet to seem sharp for an entire debate. Can he break that streak and alleviate concerns about his ability to withstand a long, vicious campaign? I’m more interested in that than the narrow questions of how he responds to Trump’s false smears against his family.

Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. They are the best-positioned candidates to benefit from Biden’s uneven campaign and win over more moderate Democrats. Can any of the three make an explicit case: I’m stronger than Biden and more electable than Warren?"

A majority of Americans want to uphold Roe v. Wade, but a longstanding 80 percent of them support restrictions of some kind (according to 2019 Gallup polling), most notably in the third trimester (as of 2018 Gallup polling, 65 percent support restrictions in second trimester as well). Only Senator Amy Klobuchar and Ms. Gabbard have admitted to supporting third-trimester restrictions. The rest, including the current front-runners Senator Elizabeth Warren and the former vice president Joe Biden, have offered rare consideration for restrictions or conversation around why such large portions of the country support them.

Abortion and reproductive rights may not be a “deal breaker” vote for swing voters, as a recent Fox News poll revealed, but it is an issue that matters deeply to them, especially those who hold faith in high regard. More to the point, it’s curious that so many Democratic candidates hold a view consistent with so few voters. No one should swap genuine beliefs about abortion to appease polling numbers, but if these candidates represent the American people, they are statistically divergent from them in a dramatic way. This may mean a few of them are hiding their authentic beliefs about abortion for political safety — but that’s to their detriment.

The answer for candidates isn’t necessarily changing policy positions but offering room for conversation with those who support restrictions and respect for an alternative position that is rooted in genuine beliefs about the origins of life.

Even Mr. Biden, viewed as a moderate, has disappointed on the issue, reversing his long-held position on banning federal funds for abortion. This has damaged his “moderate” brand slightly. He has also given into relentless badgering from progressives, endorsing the Green New Deal and bowing to liberal sexual politics with his recent announcement that he would support men who identify as women being housed with females in prison.

All of this leftward marching, for Mr. Biden and others, moves candidates further from potential voters it’s necessary to win over. These folks may not vote for Mr. Trump (or vote at all), but Democrats stand to lose this opening with them for good. Now is the time to put formerly Republican voters on notice, as Ms. Gabbard has done with her distinctive approach.

They crave the anti-Trump, not a hypocritical Kamala Harris and her indefensible record on criminal justice. Ms. Harris describes herself as a “progressive prosecutor,” but infamously upheld multiple wrongful conviction cases and failed to support a ballot initiative that would reduce penalties for nonviolent crimes. These voters also have little interest in an opportunistic Mayor Pete Buttigieg: For years in Indiana politics, he worked “cordially” with Mike Pence, then the governor, but only since becoming a rising star in the Democratic Party has the mayor chosen to demean Mr. Pence’s religious beliefs.

Ms. Gabbard and Ms. Klobuchar — who also tends to focus on winnable, bipartisan issues like lowering the price of prescription drugs — appear to be the only two candidates to understand this opportunity for new votes."

But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists and consultants from both parties.

Here is a sampling of their reactions.

Warren took fire from all sides

The strategists agreed on one thing: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s new front-runner status was clear, because she was everyone else’s biggest target. But they were divided on how well she handled the attacks.

“Warren took almost everyone’s best punch there & came away basically unscathed.” — Jesse Lehrich, former foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton “Heading into this debate as a frontrunner, she did not seem ready for the incoming.” — Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and former Democratic National Committee spokesman “This is the @ewarren debate. You might be happy or sad about it, but she’s the one who is setting the tone and she’s the reference point for most of the other candidates. That happens to the frontrunner.” — Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics

Buttigieg stood out …

Several consultants said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., had successfully set himself up as an alternative for moderate Democrats uneasy with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They particularly liked his responses on foreign policy, which he framed in terms of his own experience in the military.

“Very strong, passionate and compelling condemnation of @realDonaldTrump betrayal of Kurds from Northern Syria by @PeteButtigieg. Owning this discussion.” — David Axelrod, former chief strategist for Barack Obama “I am impressed with Buttigieg on foreign policy. Like Biden, he really shines and opens up when he talks about FP.” — Jess Morales Rocketto, political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance “This has been @PeteButtigieg’s best #DemDebate performance so far. While other candidates tried to out-left and anti-Trump each other, Mayor Pete came across as reasonable and rational.” — Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster

… and so did Klobuchar

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota received similarly positive reviews, with strategists arguing that she and Mr. Buttigieg in the middle against Ms. Warren on the left was the biggest dynamic of the night.

“@amyklobuchar performance tonight will resonate with moderate Democrats who are tired of being told that they are sellouts if they don’t subscribe to most left views. It’s a theme that’s cut across all her answers tonight & why she is having a good night.” — Jennifer Palmieri, former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama “With 11 other people on stage, you don’t get a lot of opportunities to make an impression. But she’s finding them, using each one to stand out and draw a contrast.” — Mo Elleithee “Every time Amy Klobuchar speaks she says something sensible. Not sure that makes her electable, but it’s nice to hear.” — Joe Lockhart, former spokesman for President Bill Clinton

Sanders was reassuring

After his heart attack two weeks ago, Senator Bernie Sanders badly needed to project strength and stamina, and on the whole, the consensus was that he succeeded.

“What heart attack?! @BernieSanders is giving a strong performance and not missing a step.” — Patti Solis Doyle, senior adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign “Bernie Sanders making a damn important point here — stuff in our county was bad before Trump was elected, and this election has to be about more than defeating Trump.” — Sally Kohn, progressive commentator and former campaign strategist “This was @BernieSanders’ best debate by far, but I still don’t hear him making a pitch to people who don’t already support him.” — Laura Belin, Iowa political commentator

Biden had an uneven performance

Mr. Biden won praise for his responses on foreign policy — frequently a strong area for him — but was criticized for seeming to claim credit for Ms. Warren’s work establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

“Biden needs to have a clear and compelling response to the Trump charge against him and his son, and I assumed he would have prepared one, but his answer is not sharp. When asked ‘did you make a mistake?’ he snaps back with a much sharper line.” — Robert Reich, professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and former labor secretary No one more experienced on foreign policy on this debate stage than @JoeBiden. This is where his experience shines and reminds voters that experience does matter.” — Adrienne Elrod, former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton “Biden yelling ‘I GOT you votes’ at Warren is not the best look.” — Kelly Dittmar, scholar at Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics

Other standout moments

Several other candidates got good reviews for specific answers: Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker on reproductive rights, and the former housing secretary Julián Castro for the statement, “Police violence is also gun violence.”

“Such a smart move by @KamalaHarris to refocus the conversation on women’s reproductive rights. She listened to women since the last debate and will gain attention and praise for it.” — Kelly Dittmar “@CoryBooker brings a lot to this primary, but perhaps his greatest debate contribution is his continuance to be the moral compass, reminding candidates and the audience what this campaign is really all about: defeating Trump and helping people live better lives.” — Adrienne Elrod “Castro was really strong on police violence there and brought in an angle on seizing guns that other candidates missed.” — Seth Masket, political scientist at the University of Denver

Hello?

Hey.

Hi.

Hello?

Michael.

Good morning.

maggie haberman

Right. Yes, it is.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] Yes, it is.

maggie haberman

Good morning.

michael barbaro

So believe it or not, with you being in Ohio, me in Washington, and this team of editors and producers in New York, this is not exactly a flawless technical operation at 12:35 a.m.

alexander burns

I have faith in your crack team.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] I have faith too. It’s really the technology I’m beginning to question.

alexander burns

Hmm.

michael barbaro

Hmm. O.K., let’s do this. Alex, if you were going to summarize tonight in a sentence, what would it be?

alexander burns

I think this was the night where you really saw the moderate candidates on stage find their thirst for combat. And I think, interestingly, you saw that displayed not by folks like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar going after Joe Biden, the leading moderate candidate at this point in the race, but you saw it happen by them going after Elizabeth Warren to try to sort of prove their centrist credentials by challenging the left.

michael barbaro

Right. The front-runner who’s not actually quite the front-runner. I checked the polls right before the debate and by all accounts, statistically speaking, that is Joe Biden.

alexander burns

In an average of national polls, Joe Biden has a slight lead over Elizabeth Warren still in this race. But every other candidate in the race can read those trend lines just like we can. She is moving steadily up. He is moving steadily down. And the picture is even more pronounced in the early voting states, like Iowa and New Hampshire. So if you are a Pete Buttigieg or an Amy Klobuchar and you have staked your candidacy on a breakthrough in the Midwest, it is a bigger issue for you to get past Joe Biden and present yourself as a clear, compelling alternative to Elizabeth Warren than it is to go at Joe Biden directly.

michael barbaro

O.K., so let’s talk about how that actually played out.

archived recording (anderson cooper) This is the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate.

maggie haberman

So all 12 candidates are on stage. The debate begins.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support.

maggie haberman

The first question inevitably is about impeachment. This is the first debate since the impeachment inquiry began.

archived recording (anderson cooper) But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.

maggie haberman

And you had all 12 candidates in agreement —

archived recording (bernie sanders) I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment.

maggie haberman

— that they believe that Donald Trump should be impeached.

archived recording (joe biden) They would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.

maggie haberman

This is a big change from where things were within this Democratic field even a month ago.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment.

maggie haberman

And everybody was in unison. They didn’t all necessarily agree that he should be removed from office, but they did agree that he should be impeached.

archived recording (kamala harris) Our framers imagined this moment — a moment where we would have a corrupt president.

michael barbaro

Right. It seemed like every candidate used some version of the phrase “Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country.” It was almost verbatim.

archived recording (joe biden) This president is the most corrupt president in modern history — archived recording (bernie sanders) In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president — archived recording (tom steyer) — most corrupt president in the country. And that only the voice —

maggie haberman

And look, these candidates have generally tried to avoid having these debates be specifically just about Donald Trump. This was among the most Donald Trump-heavy first 10 minutes of a debate that I can recall.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the —

maggie haberman

But instead of using that moment as a way for any of them to sort of use a back door to criticize Joe Biden over the issue related to his son and the work his son had done in Ukraine while Biden was vice president, they all very pointedly, clearly, did not want to join President Trump’s attacks on Joe Biden.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

maggie haberman

None of them brought it up on their own as the debate went on. The rest of the night was really absent any issue related to Biden except for a question from the moderators.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. If it’s not O.K. for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it O.K. for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden? archived recording (joe biden) Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government.

michael barbaro

And everyone seemed quite ready to avoid it and just move on.

alexander burns

Right. And I think that that reflects a couple of things, right?

archived recording (anderson cooper) Senator Sanders, your response? archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me make a point. I think —

alexander burns

The moderators sort of teed up Bernie Sanders, if he wanted to go after Biden on the Hunter Ukraine issue.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured.

alexander burns

Bernie just totally did not take the bait, and neither did anybody else. And part of that is I think a sense among other Democrats that going at the Hunter issue, you really, really risk sort of triggering sympathy for Biden and looking like you are taking Trump’s side in a fight. And I think maybe as big or a bigger part of it is this calculation by a lot of the candidates on stage who want Joe Biden’s supporters to move over to their camp. That the way to do that is not by attacking Joe Biden and that you kind of got to trust that Biden is going to continue sinking in this race just by the force of gravity and his own limitations as a candidate and present yourself as a compelling alternative for people who are looking for a more moderate or a more conventional set of qualifications. And they do that by going after Elizabeth Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — after that. archived recording (marc lacey) Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for “Medicare for all.” You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?

maggie haberman

And you saw that right away with a question about Medicare for all, which she has been facing repeated questions about and people trying to pin her down.

michael barbaro

Right. There’s first an effort by our colleague, Marc Lacey, to twice pin her down on whether or not her Medicare for all plan would require a tax increase for middle-class voters. She doesn’t really answer the yes or no question.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not —

michael barbaro

Then Pete Buttigieg tries to get her to answer it and on and on. And she’s just kind of resolutely unwilling to say yes or no.

alexander burns

And it’s not even really sort of an ideological attack on her, right? You saw Pete Buttigieg pushing her just to sort of be straight on this question.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out —

alexander burns

It’s almost sort of a character attack as much as anything else. She loves talking about the mechanics of policy and where revenue will come from and where it will go and how regulations work and how it will change the way companies are structured. And the fact that this is the one place where she won’t say what we heard Bernie Sanders say —

archived recording (bernie sanders) Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up.

alexander burns

It would be a super sort of Warren-y answer, except she just doesn’t want to give it.

michael barbaro

And why exactly won’t she answer it, Maggie?

maggie haberman

Well, she won’t answer it because there’s not a great answer to the question. Usually when there is not a great answer to the question, you’ll see a politician do what she is doing, which is evade steadfastly.

archived recording (marc lacey) Senator — Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up? archived recording (elizabeth warren) So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind —

maggie haberman

The answer is most likely to be that there will be a tax hike, and that’s not an answer that she wants to be holding herself to right now. I also think that she’s probably leaving herself a little bit of room — emphasis on a little — for a general election on how she might answer this question of a pay-for for this plan. Her opponent, potentially, Donald Trump, is thrilled seeing her talk about this, because Trump and his advisers believe this is going to be an area where they can really push her and try to shove her closer toward the socialist label that he’s been trying to affix to most Democrats.

michael barbaro

And Alex, what did you think was the most notable exchange inside of this first round of efforts by the moderate Democrats on this stage to come after Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

Look, I thought it was the combination of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both speaking about Warren in terms of honesty.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is —

alexander burns

You heard Klobuchar, who has been so careful so far in this race to be very collegial with her Senate colleagues.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that. And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.

alexander burns

You heard her essentially describe Warren’s plans as a pipe dream.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done, and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers —

alexander burns

This is really harsh stuff, right? This is the kind of criticism that you have heard at other points in the race directed at Joe Biden.

maggie haberman

One thing, too, that I was struck by in Klobuchar’s answer is she more than once said that essentially, to Warren, your way of doing things is not the only way.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t —

michael barbaro

And does that reflect some kind of larger sentiment among these moderate candidates about Warren and about the way that she campaigns?

alexander burns

I think it reflects a resentment among some of the more moderate candidates of the way Warren argues sometimes explicitly, sometimes a little bit more subtly, that if you don’t approach policy the same way she does, it’s because you don’t have political guts. You don’t have grit. You’re not willing to fight —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we’ve — archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — got to stop —

alexander burns

For somebody like Amy Klobuchar, she sees how you get stuff done in government differently. She doesn’t think it makes her a coward. She thinks it sort of just reflects a different set of political values.

michael barbaro

So what’s the next notable exchange?

archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Congressman. archived recording (erin burnett) Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate.

alexander burns

You have this even messier multi-candidate pile-on around Warren’s proposal for a tax on huge private fortunes.

archived recording (erin burnett) Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.

alexander burns

That it sort of begins with this exchange involving Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, the only billionaire on stage, where —

archived recording (erin burnett) What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

alexander burns

— I think there’s an attempt by the moderators to try to draw out Steyer in a way that would maybe stir some tension on stage. And he basically says, look —

archived recording (tom steyer) Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor.

alexander burns

— wealth concentration is a problem. Then the spotlight moves back to some of those moderates we talked about before.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) This is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — to who sounded better on a debate stage — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. archived recording (pete buttigieg) — debate stage or in a committee hearing — archived recording (erin burnett) Senator Klobuchar — Senator Klobuchar — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — versus what it’s actually going to take to get something done. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I want to give a reality che — archived recording (erin burnett) Will a wealth tax work? archived recording (amy klobuchar) It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

alexander burns

You hear Amy Klobuchar not attacking the idea of a wealth tax — she says that she’s open to the idea — but again criticizing Warren for this sense that Warren thinks her ideas are the only good ideas.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that, after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.

alexander burns

Nobody is actually challenging the substance of her policy idea here. And in fact, you hear people across the ideological spectrum in the party either endorsing a wealth tax or at least indicating their openness to a wealth tax.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

alexander burns

So to me, this part is more of a primal scream of frustration towards Elizabeth Warren than a really concerted policy challenge.

michael barbaro

And when you say primal scream of frustration, I’m guessing you don’t just mean the fact that they think she talks about her ideas as if they are the best and the only good ideas, but perhaps because she’s just doing really well?

alexander burns

She is doing really well, right? That if you look back to where this race was when Beto O’Rourke got into it, right, back in the late winter or early spring, he was one of the leading candidates. Elizabeth Warren was at the back of the polls and struggling to sort of find two dimes to rub together for her campaign, right? Now she is one of the biggest fundraisers in the field. He is at the back of the pack, struggling to survive. And you do see — you saw it earlier in the race with Joe Biden. You see it now with Elizabeth Warren. People who are polling towards the back of the pack, trying to have some kind of impact in this race, go after the front-runner.

archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Senator Booker. archived recording (anderson cooper) We’ve got to take a quick break. We’ve got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio. We’ll be right back after this. [APPLAUSE]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording (anderson cooper) And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered —

michael barbaro

So as this debate went on, it felt like we saw the first substantive conversation on foreign policy that I can remember from these Democratic debates, in part, I think, because of the urgency of the situation that’s playing out in Syria. I wonder if it felt that way to both of you.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Vice President Biden, we —

maggie haberman

It didn’t feel that substantive to me, candidly. It felt urgent, and it felt emotional.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership.

maggie haberman

What I think was striking about it is that Joe Biden, who was vice president, seemed to really struggle in his answer to this question about what he would do and what he thought was necessary.

archived recording (joe biden) What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where — he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real locked-down conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now. Pay that price.

maggie haberman

I think that Biden still sounded as if he wasn’t quite sure what to do. And I really thought going into this debate that this was going to be an issue that Biden was going to score lots of points on, because it’s right in his wheelhouse.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s one of the ways that Biden has tried to distinguish himself, by pointing to his experience and his gravitas, especially around matters like foreign policy and military conflict.

archived recording (joe biden) I think I may be — doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan.

alexander burns

Right. You heard him make that argument quite explicitly, that he’s the one person on stage who needs no on-the-job training, that he has dealt with Putin, he has dealt with Erdogan directly. What he struggles with, as Maggie was saying, is communicating that in a way that conveys a sense of command and reassurance to the people who are watching the debate. I did think there were at least the germs of a bigger ideological argument about foreign policy.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this —

alexander burns

You did hear a pretty stark difference between Biden, on the one hand, who, not in a terribly articulate way, talked about keeping American troops in Syria in some fashion, and Elizabeth Warren saying quite directly that she wants to get rid of those troops, just not in the way Donald Trump has gone about doing it.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to get — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no — archived recording (anderson cooper) Yeah. Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — military solution — archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor Buttigieg? archived recording (elizabeth warren) — in this region.

michael barbaro

And Alex, does that ideological breakdown, when it comes to how the United States should use military forces, does that fall along familiar domestic debate ideological fault lines? Or is it different?

alexander burns

It doesn’t map precisely onto the same fault lines as domestic policy, economic policy, health care. But I do think that the more populist wing of the party represented by Warren and Sanders and a couple other people intermittently onstage is much more skeptical of the idea of the United States being involved in foreign wars, of having permanent troop presence overseas. And it is something, Michael, as you obviously recall, that the president played to quite effectively in 2016, is this idea that there actua — there may be a consensus in Washington for the United States to play this kind of role in foreign countries, but in the rest of America, there’s a lot of exhaustion and a lot of skepticism. And that’s part of what I think was so challenging for Biden in this moment, right? That just talking about restoring the bipartisan foreign policy consensus isn’t necessarily super compelling to base primary voters, at least the ones who are voting on foreign policy.

archived recording (anderson cooper) As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.

michael barbaro

So toward the end of the debate, the moderators asked this question that sort of seems to be pointed directly at this central tension that’s been playing out on stage.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump? archived recording (joe biden) Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people.

michael barbaro

I wonder what you make of the answers to that question.

alexander burns

Well, first, I think it’s really striking that the question needed to be asked in this specific way in order to draw Biden into conflict with Warren and Sanders. In past debates, he’s been so eager to go after them on a whole range of policies. In this debate, there were big sections of the night where he seemed to really fade from the foreground of this thing. And the moderators really sort of summon him to rise to this moment as a champion of the center in this race.

archived recording (joe biden) I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done.

alexander burns

He does it by describing himself as the only person on the stage who’s ever gotten big things done. He talks about the Violence Against Women Act. He talks about the Affordable Care Act. And he runs pretty quickly into quite a challenging confrontation with both Bernie Sanders and Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington —

maggie haberman

What ended up happening was Warren starts talking about her accomplishments. She talks about what she did after the 2008 fiscal crisis. She talks about her time at the C.F.P.B. She talks about what she wants to do.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) If we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — for the things that touch people’s lives. archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor — archived recording (joe biden) I agree —

But you had Biden try to come back at Warren as she’s talking about what she did. He says, “I got you votes.”

archived recording (joe biden) I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight too.

maggie haberman

She sort of lets him finish. And there’s a pause, and you can see her almost drawing breath.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. And I am deeply —

maggie haberman

It’s a real dagger, because it’s a reminder that so much of what Joe Biden has done in this race has been talking about Obama’s record. Biden doesn’t handle that well —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) But understand — archived recording (joe biden) You did a hell of a job at your job. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Thank you. But understand this —

maggie haberman

— gets unhappy about it and pushes back that you did well in the role that you were in, meaning at the C.F.P.B. And there was just silence in the debate hall when he did it. It underscored what I think has been a theme for Biden in this race and certainly throughout the night when he was present onstage, which is it had this aura of don’t you understand that this is my turn, this is what I’m due? And it reminded me so much of what we would see with Hillary Clinton in 2016.

alexander burns

I think it was also just a total mismanagement by Biden of the dynamics of interacting with an emerging female front-runner in this race. That there was really no need, if you look at the record that he is standing on, for him to then try to sort of take a piece of her signature achievement, the creation of this new regulatory agency. And I think it was a reflection of her sort of lack of interest in escalating a fight with him, her sort of view that it didn’t make sense for her to sort of get into an extended fight with Joe Biden, that she didn’t come back at him harder on that front. It was a real role reversal from what we’ve seen in the race previously, where Joe Biden sort of goes from being the hunted to being the hunter as he sort of loses some traction at the top of this race.

archived recording (joe biden) And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who’s going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how are you going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade. archived recording (anderson cooper) Just to clarify —

michael barbaro

Alex, given the sensitive moment that Joe Biden is in right now with the president’s attacks on him and his son, is there an argument to be made that the best thing that could happen to Biden during this debate was kind of exactly what did happen? That he got to kind of hide away a little bit while all the moderates went after somebody else, Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

I think you can make the case that the best-case scenario for Biden at this point is to sort of protect the base that he has right now, hold steady, and trust the rest of the field to stay fractured. And if that’s the best case for him, then maybe that’s what he did tonight. I think it’s a really, really risky strategy, because it counts on everybody else being ineffective at appealing to the voters who are currently supporting you. So I think you could look at this as a low-risk debate for Biden, where he probably didn’t do damage to himself actively. I think you could also see it as a real missed opportunity for a guy who does have unmatched foreign policy credentials on that stage, who has been victimized by the president in a way that has launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump —

michael barbaro

Right.

alexander burns

— and who didn’t sort of wrap all that together and create a bigger moment for his campaign.

maggie haberman

I totally agree.

michael barbaro

Maggie, Alex, thank you. Good night, slash, good morning. We’ll talk soon.

We’ll be right back.

michael barbaro Are you on deadline? michael schmidt No. michael barbaro Well, I’m looking for someone to tell me what else I need to know today. michael schmidt Um —

michael schmidt

On Tuesday, George Kent, a senior State Department adviser on Ukraine, went up to Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment proceedings. In Kent’s testimony, he says that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told him not to worry about Ukraine policy. Obviously, a little weird for a State Department official who specializes in Ukraine policy.

michael barbaro

The message being, like, we’ve got Ukraine over here at the White House. You at the State Department, that’s not your issue anymore.

michael schmidt

Yet another odd way that the administration was handling its policy towards Ukraine. In the middle of this testimony, Giuliani himself puts out a letter that says that he is not going to comply with a subpoena from the House. The impeachment investigators want to talk to him. Giuliani says, nope, not coming. This is a sham, and he’s not going to participate.

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording (amy robach) If your last name wasn’t Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma? archived recording (hunter biden) I don’t know. I don’t know. Probably not. I don’t think that there’s a lot of things that would have happened in my life that — if my last name wasn’t Biden.

michael schmidt

The other thing you need to know is that Joe Biden’s son Hunter gave an interview with ABC News this morning in which he took on the attacks that Trump has leveled at him about Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And Giuliani.

michael schmidt

Correct, and Giuliani. And he basically said, was it the best thing that I sat on the board of this energy company in Ukraine? Probably not. But he says that these allegations that Giuliani and Trump have thrown at him and thrown at his father about how his dad intervened to help the energy company, it’s all nonsense. There’s nothing to it.

archived recording (hunter biden) You know what? I’m a human. And you know what? Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based upon some un — ethical lapse? Absolutely not.

Right. Yes, it is.

[LAUGHS] Yes, it is.

maggie haberman

Good morning.

michael barbaro

So believe it or not, with you being in Ohio, me in Washington, and this team of editors and producers in New York, this is not exactly a flawless technical operation at 12:35 a.m.

alexander burns

I have faith in your crack team.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] I have faith too. It’s really the technology I’m beginning to question.

alexander burns

Hmm.

michael barbaro

Hmm. O.K., let’s do this. Alex, if you were going to summarize tonight in a sentence, what would it be?

alexander burns

I think this was the night where you really saw the moderate candidates on stage find their thirst for combat. And I think, interestingly, you saw that displayed not by folks like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar going after Joe Biden, the leading moderate candidate at this point in the race, but you saw it happen by them going after Elizabeth Warren to try to sort of prove their centrist credentials by challenging the left.

michael barbaro

Right. The front-runner who’s not actually quite the front-runner. I checked the polls right before the debate and by all accounts, statistically speaking, that is Joe Biden.

alexander burns

In an average of national polls, Joe Biden has a slight lead over Elizabeth Warren still in this race. But every other candidate in the race can read those trend lines just like we can. She is moving steadily up. He is moving steadily down. And the picture is even more pronounced in the early voting states, like Iowa and New Hampshire. So if you are a Pete Buttigieg or an Amy Klobuchar and you have staked your candidacy on a breakthrough in the Midwest, it is a bigger issue for you to get past Joe Biden and present yourself as a clear, compelling alternative to Elizabeth Warren than it is to go at Joe Biden directly.

michael barbaro

O.K., so let’s talk about how that actually played out.

archived recording (anderson cooper) This is the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate.

maggie haberman

So all 12 candidates are on stage. The debate begins.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support.

maggie haberman

The first question inevitably is about impeachment. This is the first debate since the impeachment inquiry began.

archived recording (anderson cooper) But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.

maggie haberman

And you had all 12 candidates in agreement —

archived recording (bernie sanders) I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment.

maggie haberman

— that they believe that Donald Trump should be impeached.

archived recording (joe biden) They would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.

maggie haberman

This is a big change from where things were within this Democratic field even a month ago.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment.

maggie haberman

And everybody was in unison. They didn’t all necessarily agree that he should be removed from office, but they did agree that he should be impeached.

archived recording (kamala harris) Our framers imagined this moment — a moment where we would have a corrupt president.

michael barbaro

Right. It seemed like every candidate used some version of the phrase “Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country.” It was almost verbatim.

archived recording (joe biden) This president is the most corrupt president in modern history — archived recording (bernie sanders) In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president — archived recording (tom steyer) — most corrupt president in the country. And that only the voice —

maggie haberman

And look, these candidates have generally tried to avoid having these debates be specifically just about Donald Trump. This was among the most Donald Trump-heavy first 10 minutes of a debate that I can recall.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the —

maggie haberman

But instead of using that moment as a way for any of them to sort of use a back door to criticize Joe Biden over the issue related to his son and the work his son had done in Ukraine while Biden was vice president, they all very pointedly, clearly, did not want to join President Trump’s attacks on Joe Biden.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

maggie haberman

None of them brought it up on their own as the debate went on. The rest of the night was really absent any issue related to Biden except for a question from the moderators.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. If it’s not O.K. for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it O.K. for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden? archived recording (joe biden) Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government.

michael barbaro

And everyone seemed quite ready to avoid it and just move on.

alexander burns

Right. And I think that that reflects a couple of things, right?

archived recording (anderson cooper) Senator Sanders, your response? archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me make a point. I think —

alexander burns

The moderators sort of teed up Bernie Sanders, if he wanted to go after Biden on the Hunter Ukraine issue.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured.

alexander burns

Bernie just totally did not take the bait, and neither did anybody else. And part of that is I think a sense among other Democrats that going at the Hunter issue, you really, really risk sort of triggering sympathy for Biden and looking like you are taking Trump’s side in a fight. And I think maybe as big or a bigger part of it is this calculation by a lot of the candidates on stage who want Joe Biden’s supporters to move over to their camp. That the way to do that is not by attacking Joe Biden and that you kind of got to trust that Biden is going to continue sinking in this race just by the force of gravity and his own limitations as a candidate and present yourself as a compelling alternative for people who are looking for a more moderate or a more conventional set of qualifications. And they do that by going after Elizabeth Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — after that. archived recording (marc lacey) Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for “Medicare for all.” You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?

maggie haberman

And you saw that right away with a question about Medicare for all, which she has been facing repeated questions about and people trying to pin her down.

michael barbaro

Right. There’s first an effort by our colleague, Marc Lacey, to twice pin her down on whether or not her Medicare for all plan would require a tax increase for middle-class voters. She doesn’t really answer the yes or no question.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not —

michael barbaro

Then Pete Buttigieg tries to get her to answer it and on and on. And she’s just kind of resolutely unwilling to say yes or no.

alexander burns

And it’s not even really sort of an ideological attack on her, right? You saw Pete Buttigieg pushing her just to sort of be straight on this question.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out —

alexander burns

It’s almost sort of a character attack as much as anything else. She loves talking about the mechanics of policy and where revenue will come from and where it will go and how regulations work and how it will change the way companies are structured. And the fact that this is the one place where she won’t say what we heard Bernie Sanders say —

archived recording (bernie sanders) Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up.

alexander burns

It would be a super sort of Warren-y answer, except she just doesn’t want to give it.

michael barbaro

And why exactly won’t she answer it, Maggie?

maggie haberman

Well, she won’t answer it because there’s not a great answer to the question. Usually when there is not a great answer to the question, you’ll see a politician do what she is doing, which is evade steadfastly.

archived recording (marc lacey) Senator — Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up? archived recording (elizabeth warren) So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind —

maggie haberman

The answer is most likely to be that there will be a tax hike, and that’s not an answer that she wants to be holding herself to right now. I also think that she’s probably leaving herself a little bit of room — emphasis on a little — for a general election on how she might answer this question of a pay-for for this plan. Her opponent, potentially, Donald Trump, is thrilled seeing her talk about this, because Trump and his advisers believe this is going to be an area where they can really push her and try to shove her closer toward the socialist label that he’s been trying to affix to most Democrats.

michael barbaro

And Alex, what did you think was the most notable exchange inside of this first round of efforts by the moderate Democrats on this stage to come after Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

Look, I thought it was the combination of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both speaking about Warren in terms of honesty.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is —

alexander burns

You heard Klobuchar, who has been so careful so far in this race to be very collegial with her Senate colleagues.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that. And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.

alexander burns

You heard her essentially describe Warren’s plans as a pipe dream.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done, and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers —

alexander burns

This is really harsh stuff, right? This is the kind of criticism that you have heard at other points in the race directed at Joe Biden.

maggie haberman

One thing, too, that I was struck by in Klobuchar’s answer is she more than once said that essentially, to Warren, your way of doing things is not the only way.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t —

michael barbaro

And does that reflect some kind of larger sentiment among these moderate candidates about Warren and about the way that she campaigns?

alexander burns

I think it reflects a resentment among some of the more moderate candidates of the way Warren argues sometimes explicitly, sometimes a little bit more subtly, that if you don’t approach policy the same way she does, it’s because you don’t have political guts. You don’t have grit. You’re not willing to fight —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we’ve — archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — got to stop —

alexander burns

For somebody like Amy Klobuchar, she sees how you get stuff done in government differently. She doesn’t think it makes her a coward. She thinks it sort of just reflects a different set of political values.

michael barbaro

So what’s the next notable exchange?

archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Congressman. archived recording (erin burnett) Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate.

alexander burns

You have this even messier multi-candidate pile-on around Warren’s proposal for a tax on huge private fortunes.

archived recording (erin burnett) Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.

alexander burns

That it sort of begins with this exchange involving Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, the only billionaire on stage, where —

archived recording (erin burnett) What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

alexander burns

— I think there’s an attempt by the moderators to try to draw out Steyer in a way that would maybe stir some tension on stage. And he basically says, look —

archived recording (tom steyer) Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor.

alexander burns

— wealth concentration is a problem. Then the spotlight moves back to some of those moderates we talked about before.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) This is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — to who sounded better on a debate stage — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. archived recording (pete buttigieg) — debate stage or in a committee hearing — archived recording (erin burnett) Senator Klobuchar — Senator Klobuchar — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — versus what it’s actually going to take to get something done. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I want to give a reality che — archived recording (erin burnett) Will a wealth tax work? archived recording (amy klobuchar) It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

alexander burns

You hear Amy Klobuchar not attacking the idea of a wealth tax — she says that she’s open to the idea — but again criticizing Warren for this sense that Warren thinks her ideas are the only good ideas.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that, after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.

alexander burns

Nobody is actually challenging the substance of her policy idea here. And in fact, you hear people across the ideological spectrum in the party either endorsing a wealth tax or at least indicating their openness to a wealth tax.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

alexander burns

So to me, this part is more of a primal scream of frustration towards Elizabeth Warren than a really concerted policy challenge.

michael barbaro

And when you say primal scream of frustration, I’m guessing you don’t just mean the fact that they think she talks about her ideas as if they are the best and the only good ideas, but perhaps because she’s just doing really well?

alexander burns

She is doing really well, right? That if you look back to where this race was when Beto O’Rourke got into it, right, back in the late winter or early spring, he was one of the leading candidates. Elizabeth Warren was at the back of the polls and struggling to sort of find two dimes to rub together for her campaign, right? Now she is one of the biggest fundraisers in the field. He is at the back of the pack, struggling to survive. And you do see — you saw it earlier in the race with Joe Biden. You see it now with Elizabeth Warren. People who are polling towards the back of the pack, trying to have some kind of impact in this race, go after the front-runner.

archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Senator Booker. archived recording (anderson cooper) We’ve got to take a quick break. We’ve got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio. We’ll be right back after this. [APPLAUSE]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording (anderson cooper) And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered —

michael barbaro

So as this debate went on, it felt like we saw the first substantive conversation on foreign policy that I can remember from these Democratic debates, in part, I think, because of the urgency of the situation that’s playing out in Syria. I wonder if it felt that way to both of you.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Vice President Biden, we —

maggie haberman

It didn’t feel that substantive to me, candidly. It felt urgent, and it felt emotional.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership.

maggie haberman

What I think was striking about it is that Joe Biden, who was vice president, seemed to really struggle in his answer to this question about what he would do and what he thought was necessary.

archived recording (joe biden) What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where — he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real locked-down conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now. Pay that price.

maggie haberman

I think that Biden still sounded as if he wasn’t quite sure what to do. And I really thought going into this debate that this was going to be an issue that Biden was going to score lots of points on, because it’s right in his wheelhouse.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s one of the ways that Biden has tried to distinguish himself, by pointing to his experience and his gravitas, especially around matters like foreign policy and military conflict.

archived recording (joe biden) I think I may be — doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan.

alexander burns

Right. You heard him make that argument quite explicitly, that he’s the one person on stage who needs no on-the-job training, that he has dealt with Putin, he has dealt with Erdogan directly. What he struggles with, as Maggie was saying, is communicating that in a way that conveys a sense of command and reassurance to the people who are watching the debate. I did think there were at least the germs of a bigger ideological argument about foreign policy.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this —

alexander burns

You did hear a pretty stark difference between Biden, on the one hand, who, not in a terribly articulate way, talked about keeping American troops in Syria in some fashion, and Elizabeth Warren saying quite directly that she wants to get rid of those troops, just not in the way Donald Trump has gone about doing it.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to get — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no — archived recording (anderson cooper) Yeah. Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — military solution — archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor Buttigieg? archived recording (elizabeth warren) — in this region.

michael barbaro

And Alex, does that ideological breakdown, when it comes to how the United States should use military forces, does that fall along familiar domestic debate ideological fault lines? Or is it different?

alexander burns

It doesn’t map precisely onto the same fault lines as domestic policy, economic policy, health care. But I do think that the more populist wing of the party represented by Warren and Sanders and a couple other people intermittently onstage is much more skeptical of the idea of the United States being involved in foreign wars, of having permanent troop presence overseas. And it is something, Michael, as you obviously recall, that the president played to quite effectively in 2016, is this idea that there actua — there may be a consensus in Washington for the United States to play this kind of role in foreign countries, but in the rest of America, there’s a lot of exhaustion and a lot of skepticism. And that’s part of what I think was so challenging for Biden in this moment, right? That just talking about restoring the bipartisan foreign policy consensus isn’t necessarily super compelling to base primary voters, at least the ones who are voting on foreign policy.

archived recording (anderson cooper) As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.

michael barbaro

So toward the end of the debate, the moderators asked this question that sort of seems to be pointed directly at this central tension that’s been playing out on stage.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump? archived recording (joe biden) Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people.

michael barbaro

I wonder what you make of the answers to that question.

alexander burns

Well, first, I think it’s really striking that the question needed to be asked in this specific way in order to draw Biden into conflict with Warren and Sanders. In past debates, he’s been so eager to go after them on a whole range of policies. In this debate, there were big sections of the night where he seemed to really fade from the foreground of this thing. And the moderators really sort of summon him to rise to this moment as a champion of the center in this race.

archived recording (joe biden) I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done.

alexander burns

He does it by describing himself as the only person on the stage who’s ever gotten big things done. He talks about the Violence Against Women Act. He talks about the Affordable Care Act. And he runs pretty quickly into quite a challenging confrontation with both Bernie Sanders and Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington —

maggie haberman

What ended up happening was Warren starts talking about her accomplishments. She talks about what she did after the 2008 fiscal crisis. She talks about her time at the C.F.P.B. She talks about what she wants to do.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) If we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — for the things that touch people’s lives. archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor — archived recording (joe biden) I agree —

maggie haberman

But you had Biden try to come back at Warren as she’s talking about what she did. He says, “I got you votes.”

archived recording (joe biden) I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight too.

maggie haberman

She sort of lets him finish. And there’s a pause, and you can see her almost drawing breath.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. And I am deeply —

maggie haberman

It’s a real dagger, because it’s a reminder that so much of what Joe Biden has done in this race has been talking about Obama’s record. Biden doesn’t handle that well —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) But understand — archived recording (joe biden) You did a hell of a job at your job. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Thank you. But understand this —

maggie haberman

— gets unhappy about it and pushes back that you did well in the role that you were in, meaning at the C.F.P.B. And there was just silence in the debate hall when he did it. It underscored what I think has been a theme for Biden in this race and certainly throughout the night when he was present onstage, which is it had this aura of don’t you understand that this is my turn, this is what I’m due? And it reminded me so much of what we would see with Hillary Clinton in 2016.

alexander burns

I think it was also just a total mismanagement by Biden of the dynamics of interacting with an emerging female front-runner in this race. That there was really no need, if you look at the record that he is standing on, for him to then try to sort of take a piece of her signature achievement, the creation of this new regulatory agency. And I think it was a reflection of her sort of lack of interest in escalating a fight with him, her sort of view that it didn’t make sense for her to sort of get into an extended fight with Joe Biden, that she didn’t come back at him harder on that front. It was a real role reversal from what we’ve seen in the race previously, where Joe Biden sort of goes from being the hunted to being the hunter as he sort of loses some traction at the top of this race.

archived recording (joe biden) And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who’s going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how are you going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade. archived recording (anderson cooper) Just to clarify —

michael barbaro

Alex, given the sensitive moment that Joe Biden is in right now with the president’s attacks on him and his son, is there an argument to be made that the best thing that could happen to Biden during this debate was kind of exactly what did happen? That he got to kind of hide away a little bit while all the moderates went after somebody else, Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

I think you can make the case that the best-case scenario for Biden at this point is to sort of protect the base that he has right now, hold steady, and trust the rest of the field to stay fractured. And if that’s the best case for him, then maybe that’s what he did tonight. I think it’s a really, really risky strategy, because it counts on everybody else being ineffective at appealing to the voters who are currently supporting you. So I think you could look at this as a low-risk debate for Biden, where he probably didn’t do damage to himself actively. I think you could also see it as a real missed opportunity for a guy who does have unmatched foreign policy credentials on that stage, who has been victimized by the president in a way that has launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump —

michael barbaro

Right.

alexander burns

— and who didn’t sort of wrap all that together and create a bigger moment for his campaign.

maggie haberman

I totally agree.

michael barbaro Are you on deadline? michael schmidt No. michael barbaro Well, I’m looking for someone to tell me what else I need to know today. michael schmidt Um —

michael schmidt

On Tuesday, George Kent, a senior State Department adviser on Ukraine, went up to Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment proceedings. In Kent’s testimony, he says that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told him not to worry about Ukraine policy. Obviously, a little weird for a State Department official who specializes in Ukraine policy.

michael barbaro

The message being, like, we’ve got Ukraine over here at the White House. You at the State Department, that’s not your issue anymore.

michael schmidt

Yet another odd way that the administration was handling its policy towards Ukraine. In the middle of this testimony, Giuliani himself puts out a letter that says that he is not going to comply with a subpoena from the House. The impeachment investigators want to talk to him. Giuliani says, nope, not coming. This is a sham, and he’s not going to participate.

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording (amy robach) If your last name wasn’t Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma? archived recording (hunter biden) I don’t know. I don’t know. Probably not. I don’t think that there’s a lot of things that would have happened in my life that — if my last name wasn’t Biden.

michael schmidt

The other thing you need to know is that Joe Biden’s son Hunter gave an interview with ABC News this morning in which he took on the attacks that Trump has leveled at him about Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And Giuliani.

michael schmidt

Correct, and Giuliani. And he basically said, was it the best thing that I sat on the board of this energy company in Ukraine? Probably not. But he says that these allegations that Giuliani and Trump have thrown at him and thrown at his father about how his dad intervened to help the energy company, it’s all nonsense. There’s nothing to it.

archived recording (hunter biden) You know what? I’m a human. And you know what? Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based upon some un — ethical lapse? Absolutely not.

Experts Weigh In,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/us/politics/who-won-the-debate-experts-weigh-in.html,"Twitter can’t tell us whether, or how, Tuesday’s CNN/New York Times debate might change voters’ minds. But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists and consultants from both parties.

Here is a sampling of their reactions.

Warren took fire from all sides

The strategists agreed on one thing: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s new front-runner status was clear, because she was everyone else’s biggest target. But they were divided on how well she handled the attacks.

“Warren took almost everyone’s best punch there & came away basically unscathed.” — Jesse Lehrich, former foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton “Heading into this debate as a frontrunner, she did not seem ready for the incoming.” — Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and former Democratic National Committee spokesman “This is the @ewarren debate. You might be happy or sad about it, but she’s the one who is setting the tone and she’s the reference point for most of the other candidates. That happens to the frontrunner.” — Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics

Buttigieg stood out …

Several consultants said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., had successfully set himself up as an alternative for moderate Democrats uneasy with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They particularly liked his responses on foreign policy, which he framed in terms of his own experience in the military.

“Very strong, passionate and compelling condemnation of @realDonaldTrump betrayal of Kurds from Northern Syria by @PeteButtigieg. Owning this discussion.” — David Axelrod, former chief strategist for Barack Obama “I am impressed with Buttigieg on foreign policy. Like Biden, he really shines and opens up when he talks about FP.” — Jess Morales Rocketto, political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance “This has been @PeteButtigieg’s best #DemDebate performance so far. While other candidates tried to out-left and anti-Trump each other, Mayor Pete came across as reasonable and rational.” — Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster

… and so did Klobuchar

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota received similarly positive reviews, with strategists arguing that she and Mr. Buttigieg in the middle against Ms. Warren on the left was the biggest dynamic of the night.

“@amyklobuchar performance tonight will resonate with moderate Democrats who are tired of being told that they are sellouts if they don’t subscribe to most left views. It’s a theme that’s cut across all her answers tonight & why she is having a good night.” — Jennifer Palmieri, former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama “With 11 other people on stage, you don’t get a lot of opportunities to make an impression. But she’s finding them, using each one to stand out and draw a contrast.” — Mo Elleithee “Every time Amy Klobuchar speaks she says something sensible. Not sure that makes her electable, but it’s nice to hear.” — Joe Lockhart, former spokesman for President Bill Clinton

Sanders was reassuring

After his heart attack two weeks ago, Senator Bernie Sanders badly needed to project strength and stamina, and on the whole, the consensus was that he succeeded.

“What heart attack?! @BernieSanders is giving a strong performance and not missing a step.” — Patti Solis Doyle, senior adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign “Bernie Sanders making a damn important point here — stuff in our county was bad before Trump was elected, and this election has to be about more than defeating Trump.” — Sally Kohn, progressive commentator and former campaign strategist “This was @BernieSanders’ best debate by far, but I still don’t hear him making a pitch to people who don’t already support him.” — Laura Belin, Iowa political commentator

Biden had an uneven performance

Mr. Biden won praise for his responses on foreign policy — frequently a strong area for him — but was criticized for seeming to claim credit for Ms. Warren’s work establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

“Biden needs to have a clear and compelling response to the Trump charge against him and his son, and I assumed he would have prepared one, but his answer is not sharp. When asked ‘did you make a mistake?’ he snaps back with a much sharper line.” — Robert Reich, professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and former labor secretary No one more experienced on foreign policy on this debate stage than @JoeBiden. This is where his experience shines and reminds voters that experience does matter.” — Adrienne Elrod, former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton “Biden yelling ‘I GOT you votes’ at Warren is not the best look.” — Kelly Dittmar, scholar at Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics

Other standout moments

Several other candidates got good reviews for specific answers: Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker on reproductive rights, and the former housing secretary Julián Castro for the statement, “Police violence is also gun violence.”

“Such a smart move by @KamalaHarris to refocus the conversation on women’s reproductive rights. She listened to women since the last debate and will gain attention and praise for it.” — Kelly Dittmar “@CoryBooker brings a lot to this primary, but perhaps his greatest debate contribution is his continuance to be the moral compass, reminding candidates and the audience what this campaign is really all about: defeating Trump and helping people live better lives.” — Adrienne Elrod “Castro was really strong on police violence there and brought in an angle on seizing guns that other candidates missed.” — Seth Masket, political scientist at the University of Denver

I know what the job is. I’ve been engaged. Look, one of the reasons I’m running is because of my age and my experience. With it comes wisdom. We need someone to take office this time around who on Day 1 can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders from Putin to our allies, and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track. It is required, now more than any time in any of our lifetimes, to have someone who has that capacity on Day 1. That’s one of the reasons why I decided to run, why I decided to run this time, because I know what has to be done. I’ve done it before. I’ve been there when we pulled the nation out of the worst financial recession in history. I’ve been there, and I’ve got so many pieces of legislation passed, including the Affordable Care Act as well as making sure that we had the Recovery Act, which kept us from going into a depression. I know what has to be done. I will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office. And I will release my medical records, as I have 21 years of my tax records, which no one else on this stage has done, so that you can have full transparency as to my health and what I am doing.

BURNETT: Just to be clear, Mr. Vice President, when will you release those records?

BIDEN: Before the first vote.

BURNETT: Before Iowa?

BIDEN: Yes.

BURNETT: Not by the end of this year?

BIDEN: Well, before Iowa. I mean, look, I’ve released them before. I released 55 pages of my — I’m the only guy that’s released anything up here.

BURNETT: Senator Warren, like Senator Sanders and Vice President Biden, if you win the presidency, you would be the oldest president ever inaugurated in a first term. You would be 71. Forty percent of Democratic primary voters say they think a candidate under the age of 70 is more likely to defeat President Trump. What do you say to them?

WARREN: Well, I say I will outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with. Look, the way I see this, the way we’re going to win is by addressing head-on what millions of Americans know in their bones, and that is that the wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy, and they’re making it work for themselves and leaving everyone else behind. And political pundits and Washington insiders and, shoot, people in our own party don’t want to admit that. They think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy. They are wrong. If all Democrats can promise is after Donald Trump, it will be business as usual, then we will lose. Democrats win when we call out what’s broken and we show how to fix it. Democrats will win when we fight for the things that touch people’s lives, things like child care and health care and housing costs. Democrats will win when we give people a reason to get in the fight."

Good morning.

michael barbaro

So believe it or not, with you being in Ohio, me in Washington, and this team of editors and producers in New York, this is not exactly a flawless technical operation at 12:35 a.m.

alexander burns

I have faith in your crack team.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] I have faith too. It’s really the technology I’m beginning to question.

alexander burns

Hmm.

michael barbaro

Hmm. O.K., let’s do this. Alex, if you were going to summarize tonight in a sentence, what would it be?

alexander burns

I think this was the night where you really saw the moderate candidates on stage find their thirst for combat. And I think, interestingly, you saw that displayed not by folks like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar going after Joe Biden, the leading moderate candidate at this point in the race, but you saw it happen by them going after Elizabeth Warren to try to sort of prove their centrist credentials by challenging the left.

michael barbaro

Right. The front-runner who’s not actually quite the front-runner. I checked the polls right before the debate and by all accounts, statistically speaking, that is Joe Biden.

alexander burns

In an average of national polls, Joe Biden has a slight lead over Elizabeth Warren still in this race. But every other candidate in the race can read those trend lines just like we can. She is moving steadily up. He is moving steadily down. And the picture is even more pronounced in the early voting states, like Iowa and New Hampshire. So if you are a Pete Buttigieg or an Amy Klobuchar and you have staked your candidacy on a breakthrough in the Midwest, it is a bigger issue for you to get past Joe Biden and present yourself as a clear, compelling alternative to Elizabeth Warren than it is to go at Joe Biden directly.

michael barbaro

O.K., so let’s talk about how that actually played out.

archived recording (anderson cooper) This is the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate.

maggie haberman

So all 12 candidates are on stage. The debate begins.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support.

maggie haberman

The first question inevitably is about impeachment. This is the first debate since the impeachment inquiry began.

archived recording (anderson cooper) But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.

maggie haberman

And you had all 12 candidates in agreement —

archived recording (bernie sanders) I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment.

maggie haberman

— that they believe that Donald Trump should be impeached.

archived recording (joe biden) They would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.

maggie haberman

This is a big change from where things were within this Democratic field even a month ago.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment.

maggie haberman

And everybody was in unison. They didn’t all necessarily agree that he should be removed from office, but they did agree that he should be impeached.

archived recording (kamala harris) Our framers imagined this moment — a moment where we would have a corrupt president.

michael barbaro

Right. It seemed like every candidate used some version of the phrase “Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country.” It was almost verbatim.

archived recording (joe biden) This president is the most corrupt president in modern history — archived recording (bernie sanders) In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president — archived recording (tom steyer) — most corrupt president in the country. And that only the voice —

maggie haberman

And look, these candidates have generally tried to avoid having these debates be specifically just about Donald Trump. This was among the most Donald Trump-heavy first 10 minutes of a debate that I can recall.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the —

maggie haberman

But instead of using that moment as a way for any of them to sort of use a back door to criticize Joe Biden over the issue related to his son and the work his son had done in Ukraine while Biden was vice president, they all very pointedly, clearly, did not want to join President Trump’s attacks on Joe Biden.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

maggie haberman

None of them brought it up on their own as the debate went on. The rest of the night was really absent any issue related to Biden except for a question from the moderators.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. If it’s not O.K. for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it O.K. for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden? archived recording (joe biden) Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government.

michael barbaro

And everyone seemed quite ready to avoid it and just move on.

alexander burns

Right. And I think that that reflects a couple of things, right?

archived recording (anderson cooper) Senator Sanders, your response? archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me make a point. I think —

alexander burns

The moderators sort of teed up Bernie Sanders, if he wanted to go after Biden on the Hunter Ukraine issue.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured.

alexander burns

Bernie just totally did not take the bait, and neither did anybody else. And part of that is I think a sense among other Democrats that going at the Hunter issue, you really, really risk sort of triggering sympathy for Biden and looking like you are taking Trump’s side in a fight. And I think maybe as big or a bigger part of it is this calculation by a lot of the candidates on stage who want Joe Biden’s supporters to move over to their camp. That the way to do that is not by attacking Joe Biden and that you kind of got to trust that Biden is going to continue sinking in this race just by the force of gravity and his own limitations as a candidate and present yourself as a compelling alternative for people who are looking for a more moderate or a more conventional set of qualifications. And they do that by going after Elizabeth Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — after that. archived recording (marc lacey) Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for “Medicare for all.” You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?

maggie haberman

And you saw that right away with a question about Medicare for all, which she has been facing repeated questions about and people trying to pin her down.

michael barbaro

Right. There’s first an effort by our colleague, Marc Lacey, to twice pin her down on whether or not her Medicare for all plan would require a tax increase for middle-class voters. She doesn’t really answer the yes or no question.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not —

michael barbaro

Then Pete Buttigieg tries to get her to answer it and on and on. And she’s just kind of resolutely unwilling to say yes or no.

alexander burns

And it’s not even really sort of an ideological attack on her, right? You saw Pete Buttigieg pushing her just to sort of be straight on this question.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out —

alexander burns

It’s almost sort of a character attack as much as anything else. She loves talking about the mechanics of policy and where revenue will come from and where it will go and how regulations work and how it will change the way companies are structured. And the fact that this is the one place where she won’t say what we heard Bernie Sanders say —

archived recording (bernie sanders) Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up.

alexander burns

It would be a super sort of Warren-y answer, except she just doesn’t want to give it.

michael barbaro

And why exactly won’t she answer it, Maggie?

maggie haberman

Well, she won’t answer it because there’s not a great answer to the question. Usually when there is not a great answer to the question, you’ll see a politician do what she is doing, which is evade steadfastly.

archived recording (marc lacey) Senator — Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up? archived recording (elizabeth warren) So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind —

maggie haberman

The answer is most likely to be that there will be a tax hike, and that’s not an answer that she wants to be holding herself to right now. I also think that she’s probably leaving herself a little bit of room — emphasis on a little — for a general election on how she might answer this question of a pay-for for this plan. Her opponent, potentially, Donald Trump, is thrilled seeing her talk about this, because Trump and his advisers believe this is going to be an area where they can really push her and try to shove her closer toward the socialist label that he’s been trying to affix to most Democrats.

michael barbaro

And Alex, what did you think was the most notable exchange inside of this first round of efforts by the moderate Democrats on this stage to come after Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

Look, I thought it was the combination of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both speaking about Warren in terms of honesty.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is —

alexander burns

You heard Klobuchar, who has been so careful so far in this race to be very collegial with her Senate colleagues.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that. And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.

alexander burns

You heard her essentially describe Warren’s plans as a pipe dream.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done, and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers —

alexander burns

This is really harsh stuff, right? This is the kind of criticism that you have heard at other points in the race directed at Joe Biden.

maggie haberman

One thing, too, that I was struck by in Klobuchar’s answer is she more than once said that essentially, to Warren, your way of doing things is not the only way.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t —

michael barbaro

And does that reflect some kind of larger sentiment among these moderate candidates about Warren and about the way that she campaigns?

alexander burns

I think it reflects a resentment among some of the more moderate candidates of the way Warren argues sometimes explicitly, sometimes a little bit more subtly, that if you don’t approach policy the same way she does, it’s because you don’t have political guts. You don’t have grit. You’re not willing to fight —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we’ve — archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — got to stop —

alexander burns

For somebody like Amy Klobuchar, she sees how you get stuff done in government differently. She doesn’t think it makes her a coward. She thinks it sort of just reflects a different set of political values.

michael barbaro

So what’s the next notable exchange?

archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Congressman. archived recording (erin burnett) Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate.

alexander burns

You have this even messier multi-candidate pile-on around Warren’s proposal for a tax on huge private fortunes.

archived recording (erin burnett) Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.

alexander burns

That it sort of begins with this exchange involving Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, the only billionaire on stage, where —

archived recording (erin burnett) What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

alexander burns

— I think there’s an attempt by the moderators to try to draw out Steyer in a way that would maybe stir some tension on stage. And he basically says, look —

archived recording (tom steyer) Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor.

alexander burns

— wealth concentration is a problem. Then the spotlight moves back to some of those moderates we talked about before.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) This is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — to who sounded better on a debate stage — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. archived recording (pete buttigieg) — debate stage or in a committee hearing — archived recording (erin burnett) Senator Klobuchar — Senator Klobuchar — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — versus what it’s actually going to take to get something done. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I want to give a reality che — archived recording (erin burnett) Will a wealth tax work? archived recording (amy klobuchar) It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

alexander burns

You hear Amy Klobuchar not attacking the idea of a wealth tax — she says that she’s open to the idea — but again criticizing Warren for this sense that Warren thinks her ideas are the only good ideas.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that, after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.

alexander burns

Nobody is actually challenging the substance of her policy idea here. And in fact, you hear people across the ideological spectrum in the party either endorsing a wealth tax or at least indicating their openness to a wealth tax.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

alexander burns

So to me, this part is more of a primal scream of frustration towards Elizabeth Warren than a really concerted policy challenge.

michael barbaro

And when you say primal scream of frustration, I’m guessing you don’t just mean the fact that they think she talks about her ideas as if they are the best and the only good ideas, but perhaps because she’s just doing really well?

alexander burns

She is doing really well, right? That if you look back to where this race was when Beto O’Rourke got into it, right, back in the late winter or early spring, he was one of the leading candidates. Elizabeth Warren was at the back of the polls and struggling to sort of find two dimes to rub together for her campaign, right? Now she is one of the biggest fundraisers in the field. He is at the back of the pack, struggling to survive. And you do see — you saw it earlier in the race with Joe Biden. You see it now with Elizabeth Warren. People who are polling towards the back of the pack, trying to have some kind of impact in this race, go after the front-runner.

archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Senator Booker. archived recording (anderson cooper) We’ve got to take a quick break. We’ve got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio. We’ll be right back after this. [APPLAUSE]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording (anderson cooper) And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered —

michael barbaro

So as this debate went on, it felt like we saw the first substantive conversation on foreign policy that I can remember from these Democratic debates, in part, I think, because of the urgency of the situation that’s playing out in Syria. I wonder if it felt that way to both of you.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Vice President Biden, we —

maggie haberman

It didn’t feel that substantive to me, candidly. It felt urgent, and it felt emotional.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership.

maggie haberman

What I think was striking about it is that Joe Biden, who was vice president, seemed to really struggle in his answer to this question about what he would do and what he thought was necessary.

archived recording (joe biden) What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where — he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real locked-down conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now. Pay that price.

maggie haberman

I think that Biden still sounded as if he wasn’t quite sure what to do. And I really thought going into this debate that this was going to be an issue that Biden was going to score lots of points on, because it’s right in his wheelhouse.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s one of the ways that Biden has tried to distinguish himself, by pointing to his experience and his gravitas, especially around matters like foreign policy and military conflict.

archived recording (joe biden) I think I may be — doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan.

alexander burns

Right. You heard him make that argument quite explicitly, that he’s the one person on stage who needs no on-the-job training, that he has dealt with Putin, he has dealt with Erdogan directly. What he struggles with, as Maggie was saying, is communicating that in a way that conveys a sense of command and reassurance to the people who are watching the debate. I did think there were at least the germs of a bigger ideological argument about foreign policy.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this —

alexander burns

You did hear a pretty stark difference between Biden, on the one hand, who, not in a terribly articulate way, talked about keeping American troops in Syria in some fashion, and Elizabeth Warren saying quite directly that she wants to get rid of those troops, just not in the way Donald Trump has gone about doing it.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to get — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no — archived recording (anderson cooper) Yeah. Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — military solution — archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor Buttigieg? archived recording (elizabeth warren) — in this region.

michael barbaro

And Alex, does that ideological breakdown, when it comes to how the United States should use military forces, does that fall along familiar domestic debate ideological fault lines? Or is it different?

alexander burns

It doesn’t map precisely onto the same fault lines as domestic policy, economic policy, health care. But I do think that the more populist wing of the party represented by Warren and Sanders and a couple other people intermittently onstage is much more skeptical of the idea of the United States being involved in foreign wars, of having permanent troop presence overseas. And it is something, Michael, as you obviously recall, that the president played to quite effectively in 2016, is this idea that there actua — there may be a consensus in Washington for the United States to play this kind of role in foreign countries, but in the rest of America, there’s a lot of exhaustion and a lot of skepticism. And that’s part of what I think was so challenging for Biden in this moment, right? That just talking about restoring the bipartisan foreign policy consensus isn’t necessarily super compelling to base primary voters, at least the ones who are voting on foreign policy.

archived recording (anderson cooper) As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.

michael barbaro

So toward the end of the debate, the moderators asked this question that sort of seems to be pointed directly at this central tension that’s been playing out on stage.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump? archived recording (joe biden) Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people.

michael barbaro

I wonder what you make of the answers to that question.

alexander burns

Well, first, I think it’s really striking that the question needed to be asked in this specific way in order to draw Biden into conflict with Warren and Sanders. In past debates, he’s been so eager to go after them on a whole range of policies. In this debate, there were big sections of the night where he seemed to really fade from the foreground of this thing. And the moderators really sort of summon him to rise to this moment as a champion of the center in this race.

archived recording (joe biden) I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done.

alexander burns

He does it by describing himself as the only person on the stage who’s ever gotten big things done. He talks about the Violence Against Women Act. He talks about the Affordable Care Act. And he runs pretty quickly into quite a challenging confrontation with both Bernie Sanders and Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington —

maggie haberman

What ended up happening was Warren starts talking about her accomplishments. She talks about what she did after the 2008 fiscal crisis. She talks about her time at the C.F.P.B. She talks about what she wants to do.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) If we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — for the things that touch people’s lives. archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor — archived recording (joe biden) I agree —

maggie haberman

But you had Biden try to come back at Warren as she’s talking about what she did. He says, “I got you votes.”

archived recording (joe biden) I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight too.

maggie haberman

She sort of lets him finish. And there’s a pause, and you can see her almost drawing breath.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. And I am deeply —

maggie haberman

It’s a real dagger, because it’s a reminder that so much of what Joe Biden has done in this race has been talking about Obama’s record. Biden doesn’t handle that well —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) But understand — archived recording (joe biden) You did a hell of a job at your job. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Thank you. But understand this —

maggie haberman

— gets unhappy about it and pushes back that you did well in the role that you were in, meaning at the C.F.P.B. And there was just silence in the debate hall when he did it. It underscored what I think has been a theme for Biden in this race and certainly throughout the night when he was present onstage, which is it had this aura of don’t you understand that this is my turn, this is what I’m due? And it reminded me so much of what we would see with Hillary Clinton in 2016.

alexander burns

I think it was also just a total mismanagement by Biden of the dynamics of interacting with an emerging female front-runner in this race. That there was really no need, if you look at the record that he is standing on, for him to then try to sort of take a piece of her signature achievement, the creation of this new regulatory agency. And I think it was a reflection of her sort of lack of interest in escalating a fight with him, her sort of view that it didn’t make sense for her to sort of get into an extended fight with Joe Biden, that she didn’t come back at him harder on that front. It was a real role reversal from what we’ve seen in the race previously, where Joe Biden sort of goes from being the hunted to being the hunter as he sort of loses some traction at the top of this race.

archived recording (joe biden) And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who’s going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how are you going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade. archived recording (anderson cooper) Just to clarify —

michael barbaro

Alex, given the sensitive moment that Joe Biden is in right now with the president’s attacks on him and his son, is there an argument to be made that the best thing that could happen to Biden during this debate was kind of exactly what did happen? That he got to kind of hide away a little bit while all the moderates went after somebody else, Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

I think you can make the case that the best-case scenario for Biden at this point is to sort of protect the base that he has right now, hold steady, and trust the rest of the field to stay fractured. And if that’s the best case for him, then maybe that’s what he did tonight. I think it’s a really, really risky strategy, because it counts on everybody else being ineffective at appealing to the voters who are currently supporting you. So I think you could look at this as a low-risk debate for Biden, where he probably didn’t do damage to himself actively. I think you could also see it as a real missed opportunity for a guy who does have unmatched foreign policy credentials on that stage, who has been victimized by the president in a way that has launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump —

michael barbaro

Right.

alexander burns

— and who didn’t sort of wrap all that together and create a bigger moment for his campaign.

maggie haberman

I totally agree.

michael barbaro

Maggie, Alex, thank you. Good night, slash, good morning. We’ll talk soon.

We’ll be right back.

michael barbaro Are you on deadline? michael schmidt No. michael barbaro Well, I’m looking for someone to tell me what else I need to know today. michael schmidt Um —

michael schmidt

On Tuesday, George Kent, a senior State Department adviser on Ukraine, went up to Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment proceedings. In Kent’s testimony, he says that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told him not to worry about Ukraine policy. Obviously, a little weird for a State Department official who specializes in Ukraine policy.

michael barbaro

The message being, like, we’ve got Ukraine over here at the White House. You at the State Department, that’s not your issue anymore.

michael schmidt

Yet another odd way that the administration was handling its policy towards Ukraine. In the middle of this testimony, Giuliani himself puts out a letter that says that he is not going to comply with a subpoena from the House. The impeachment investigators want to talk to him. Giuliani says, nope, not coming. This is a sham, and he’s not going to participate.

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording (amy robach) If your last name wasn’t Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma? archived recording (hunter biden) I don’t know. I don’t know. Probably not. I don’t think that there’s a lot of things that would have happened in my life that — if my last name wasn’t Biden.

michael schmidt

The other thing you need to know is that Joe Biden’s son Hunter gave an interview with ABC News this morning in which he took on the attacks that Trump has leveled at him about Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And Giuliani.

michael schmidt

Correct, and Giuliani. And he basically said, was it the best thing that I sat on the board of this energy company in Ukraine? Probably not. But he says that these allegations that Giuliani and Trump have thrown at him and thrown at his father about how his dad intervened to help the energy company, it’s all nonsense. There’s nothing to it.

archived recording (hunter biden) You know what? I’m a human. And you know what? Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based upon some un — ethical lapse? Absolutely not.

And I think, interestingly, you saw that displayed not by folks like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar going after Joe Biden, the leading moderate candidate at this point in the race, but you saw it happen by them going after Elizabeth Warren to try to sort of prove their centrist credentials by challenging the left.

michael barbaro

Right. The front-runner who’s not actually quite the front-runner. I checked the polls right before the debate and by all accounts, statistically speaking, that is Joe Biden.

alexander burns

In an average of national polls, Joe Biden has a slight lead over Elizabeth Warren still in this race. But every other candidate in the race can read those trend lines just like we can. She is moving steadily up. He is moving steadily down. And the picture is even more pronounced in the early voting states, like Iowa and New Hampshire. So if you are a Pete Buttigieg or an Amy Klobuchar and you have staked your candidacy on a breakthrough in the Midwest, it is a bigger issue for you to get past Joe Biden and present yourself as a clear, compelling alternative to Elizabeth Warren than it is to go at Joe Biden directly.

michael barbaro

O.K., so let’s talk about how that actually played out.

archived recording (anderson cooper) This is the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate.

maggie haberman

So all 12 candidates are on stage. The debate begins.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support.

maggie haberman

The first question inevitably is about impeachment. This is the first debate since the impeachment inquiry began.

archived recording (anderson cooper) But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.

maggie haberman

And you had all 12 candidates in agreement —

archived recording (bernie sanders) I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment.

maggie haberman

— that they believe that Donald Trump should be impeached.

archived recording (joe biden) They would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.

maggie haberman

This is a big change from where things were within this Democratic field even a month ago.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment.

maggie haberman

And everybody was in unison. They didn’t all necessarily agree that he should be removed from office, but they did agree that he should be impeached.

archived recording (kamala harris) Our framers imagined this moment — a moment where we would have a corrupt president.

michael barbaro

Right. It seemed like every candidate used some version of the phrase “Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country.” It was almost verbatim.

archived recording (joe biden) This president is the most corrupt president in modern history — archived recording (bernie sanders) In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president — archived recording (tom steyer) — most corrupt president in the country. And that only the voice —

maggie haberman

And look, these candidates have generally tried to avoid having these debates be specifically just about Donald Trump. This was among the most Donald Trump-heavy first 10 minutes of a debate that I can recall.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the —

maggie haberman

But instead of using that moment as a way for any of them to sort of use a back door to criticize Joe Biden over the issue related to his son and the work his son had done in Ukraine while Biden was vice president, they all very pointedly, clearly, did not want to join President Trump’s attacks on Joe Biden.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

maggie haberman

None of them brought it up on their own as the debate went on. The rest of the night was really absent any issue related to Biden except for a question from the moderators.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. If it’s not O.K. for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it O.K. for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden? archived recording (joe biden) Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government.

michael barbaro

And everyone seemed quite ready to avoid it and just move on.

alexander burns

Right. And I think that that reflects a couple of things, right?

archived recording (anderson cooper) Senator Sanders, your response? archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me make a point. I think —

alexander burns

The moderators sort of teed up Bernie Sanders, if he wanted to go after Biden on the Hunter Ukraine issue.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured.

alexander burns

Bernie just totally did not take the bait, and neither did anybody else. And part of that is I think a sense among other Democrats that going at the Hunter issue, you really, really risk sort of triggering sympathy for Biden and looking like you are taking Trump’s side in a fight. And I think maybe as big or a bigger part of it is this calculation by a lot of the candidates on stage who want Joe Biden’s supporters to move over to their camp. That the way to do that is not by attacking Joe Biden and that you kind of got to trust that Biden is going to continue sinking in this race just by the force of gravity and his own limitations as a candidate and present yourself as a compelling alternative for people who are looking for a more moderate or a more conventional set of qualifications. And they do that by going after Elizabeth Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — after that. archived recording (marc lacey) Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for “Medicare for all.” You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?

maggie haberman

And you saw that right away with a question about Medicare for all, which she has been facing repeated questions about and people trying to pin her down.

michael barbaro

Right. There’s first an effort by our colleague, Marc Lacey, to twice pin her down on whether or not her Medicare for all plan would require a tax increase for middle-class voters. She doesn’t really answer the yes or no question.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not —

michael barbaro

Then Pete Buttigieg tries to get her to answer it and on and on. And she’s just kind of resolutely unwilling to say yes or no.

alexander burns

And it’s not even really sort of an ideological attack on her, right? You saw Pete Buttigieg pushing her just to sort of be straight on this question.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out —

alexander burns

It’s almost sort of a character attack as much as anything else. She loves talking about the mechanics of policy and where revenue will come from and where it will go and how regulations work and how it will change the way companies are structured. And the fact that this is the one place where she won’t say what we heard Bernie Sanders say —

archived recording (bernie sanders) Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up.

alexander burns

It would be a super sort of Warren-y answer, except she just doesn’t want to give it.

michael barbaro

And why exactly won’t she answer it, Maggie?

maggie haberman

Well, she won’t answer it because there’s not a great answer to the question. Usually when there is not a great answer to the question, you’ll see a politician do what she is doing, which is evade steadfastly.

archived recording (marc lacey) Senator — Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up? archived recording (elizabeth warren) So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind —

maggie haberman

The answer is most likely to be that there will be a tax hike, and that’s not an answer that she wants to be holding herself to right now. I also think that she’s probably leaving herself a little bit of room — emphasis on a little — for a general election on how she might answer this question of a pay-for for this plan. Her opponent, potentially, Donald Trump, is thrilled seeing her talk about this, because Trump and his advisers believe this is going to be an area where they can really push her and try to shove her closer toward the socialist label that he’s been trying to affix to most Democrats.

michael barbaro

And Alex, what did you think was the most notable exchange inside of this first round of efforts by the moderate Democrats on this stage to come after Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

Look, I thought it was the combination of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both speaking about Warren in terms of honesty.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is —

alexander burns

You heard Klobuchar, who has been so careful so far in this race to be very collegial with her Senate colleagues.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that. And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.

alexander burns

You heard her essentially describe Warren’s plans as a pipe dream.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done, and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers —

alexander burns

This is really harsh stuff, right? This is the kind of criticism that you have heard at other points in the race directed at Joe Biden.

maggie haberman

One thing, too, that I was struck by in Klobuchar’s answer is she more than once said that essentially, to Warren, your way of doing things is not the only way.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t —

michael barbaro

And does that reflect some kind of larger sentiment among these moderate candidates about Warren and about the way that she campaigns?

alexander burns

I think it reflects a resentment among some of the more moderate candidates of the way Warren argues sometimes explicitly, sometimes a little bit more subtly, that if you don’t approach policy the same way she does, it’s because you don’t have political guts. You don’t have grit. You’re not willing to fight —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we’ve — archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — got to stop —

alexander burns

For somebody like Amy Klobuchar, she sees how you get stuff done in government differently. She doesn’t think it makes her a coward. She thinks it sort of just reflects a different set of political values.

michael barbaro

So what’s the next notable exchange?

archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Congressman. archived recording (erin burnett) Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate.

alexander burns

You have this even messier multi-candidate pile-on around Warren’s proposal for a tax on huge private fortunes.

archived recording (erin burnett) Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.

alexander burns

That it sort of begins with this exchange involving Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, the only billionaire on stage, where —

archived recording (erin burnett) What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

alexander burns

— I think there’s an attempt by the moderators to try to draw out Steyer in a way that would maybe stir some tension on stage. And he basically says, look —

archived recording (tom steyer) Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor.

alexander burns

— wealth concentration is a problem. Then the spotlight moves back to some of those moderates we talked about before.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) This is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — to who sounded better on a debate stage — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. archived recording (pete buttigieg) — debate stage or in a committee hearing — archived recording (erin burnett) Senator Klobuchar — Senator Klobuchar — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — versus what it’s actually going to take to get something done. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I want to give a reality che — archived recording (erin burnett) Will a wealth tax work? archived recording (amy klobuchar) It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

alexander burns

You hear Amy Klobuchar not attacking the idea of a wealth tax — she says that she’s open to the idea — but again criticizing Warren for this sense that Warren thinks her ideas are the only good ideas.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that, after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.

alexander burns

Nobody is actually challenging the substance of her policy idea here. And in fact, you hear people across the ideological spectrum in the party either endorsing a wealth tax or at least indicating their openness to a wealth tax.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

alexander burns

So to me, this part is more of a primal scream of frustration towards Elizabeth Warren than a really concerted policy challenge.

michael barbaro

And when you say primal scream of frustration, I’m guessing you don’t just mean the fact that they think she talks about her ideas as if they are the best and the only good ideas, but perhaps because she’s just doing really well?

alexander burns

She is doing really well, right? That if you look back to where this race was when Beto O’Rourke got into it, right, back in the late winter or early spring, he was one of the leading candidates. Elizabeth Warren was at the back of the polls and struggling to sort of find two dimes to rub together for her campaign, right? Now she is one of the biggest fundraisers in the field. He is at the back of the pack, struggling to survive. And you do see — you saw it earlier in the race with Joe Biden. You see it now with Elizabeth Warren. People who are polling towards the back of the pack, trying to have some kind of impact in this race, go after the front-runner.

archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Senator Booker. archived recording (anderson cooper) We’ve got to take a quick break. We’ve got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio. We’ll be right back after this. [APPLAUSE]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording (anderson cooper) And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered —

michael barbaro

So as this debate went on, it felt like we saw the first substantive conversation on foreign policy that I can remember from these Democratic debates, in part, I think, because of the urgency of the situation that’s playing out in Syria. I wonder if it felt that way to both of you.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Vice President Biden, we —

maggie haberman

It didn’t feel that substantive to me, candidly. It felt urgent, and it felt emotional.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership.

maggie haberman

What I think was striking about it is that Joe Biden, who was vice president, seemed to really struggle in his answer to this question about what he would do and what he thought was necessary.

archived recording (joe biden) What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where — he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real locked-down conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now. Pay that price.

maggie haberman

I think that Biden still sounded as if he wasn’t quite sure what to do. And I really thought going into this debate that this was going to be an issue that Biden was going to score lots of points on, because it’s right in his wheelhouse.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s one of the ways that Biden has tried to distinguish himself, by pointing to his experience and his gravitas, especially around matters like foreign policy and military conflict.

archived recording (joe biden) I think I may be — doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan.

alexander burns

Right. You heard him make that argument quite explicitly, that he’s the one person on stage who needs no on-the-job training, that he has dealt with Putin, he has dealt with Erdogan directly. What he struggles with, as Maggie was saying, is communicating that in a way that conveys a sense of command and reassurance to the people who are watching the debate. I did think there were at least the germs of a bigger ideological argument about foreign policy.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this —

alexander burns

You did hear a pretty stark difference between Biden, on the one hand, who, not in a terribly articulate way, talked about keeping American troops in Syria in some fashion, and Elizabeth Warren saying quite directly that she wants to get rid of those troops, just not in the way Donald Trump has gone about doing it.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to get — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no — archived recording (anderson cooper) Yeah. Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — military solution — archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor Buttigieg? archived recording (elizabeth warren) — in this region.

michael barbaro

And Alex, does that ideological breakdown, when it comes to how the United States should use military forces, does that fall along familiar domestic debate ideological fault lines? Or is it different?

alexander burns

It doesn’t map precisely onto the same fault lines as domestic policy, economic policy, health care. But I do think that the more populist wing of the party represented by Warren and Sanders and a couple other people intermittently onstage is much more skeptical of the idea of the United States being involved in foreign wars, of having permanent troop presence overseas. And it is something, Michael, as you obviously recall, that the president played to quite effectively in 2016, is this idea that there actua — there may be a consensus in Washington for the United States to play this kind of role in foreign countries, but in the rest of America, there’s a lot of exhaustion and a lot of skepticism. And that’s part of what I think was so challenging for Biden in this moment, right? That just talking about restoring the bipartisan foreign policy consensus isn’t necessarily super compelling to base primary voters, at least the ones who are voting on foreign policy.

archived recording (anderson cooper) As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.

michael barbaro

So toward the end of the debate, the moderators asked this question that sort of seems to be pointed directly at this central tension that’s been playing out on stage.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump? archived recording (joe biden) Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people.

michael barbaro

I wonder what you make of the answers to that question.

alexander burns

Well, first, I think it’s really striking that the question needed to be asked in this specific way in order to draw Biden into conflict with Warren and Sanders. In past debates, he’s been so eager to go after them on a whole range of policies. In this debate, there were big sections of the night where he seemed to really fade from the foreground of this thing. And the moderators really sort of summon him to rise to this moment as a champion of the center in this race.

archived recording (joe biden) I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done.

alexander burns

He does it by describing himself as the only person on the stage who’s ever gotten big things done. He talks about the Violence Against Women Act. He talks about the Affordable Care Act. And he runs pretty quickly into quite a challenging confrontation with both Bernie Sanders and Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington —

maggie haberman

What ended up happening was Warren starts talking about her accomplishments. She talks about what she did after the 2008 fiscal crisis. She talks about her time at the C.F.P.B. She talks about what she wants to do.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) If we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — for the things that touch people’s lives. archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor — archived recording (joe biden) I agree —

maggie haberman

But you had Biden try to come back at Warren as she’s talking about what she did. He says, “I got you votes.”

archived recording (joe biden) I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight too.

maggie haberman

She sort of lets him finish. And there’s a pause, and you can see her almost drawing breath.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. And I am deeply —

maggie haberman

It’s a real dagger, because it’s a reminder that so much of what Joe Biden has done in this race has been talking about Obama’s record. Biden doesn’t handle that well —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) But understand — archived recording (joe biden) You did a hell of a job at your job. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Thank you. But understand this —

maggie haberman

— gets unhappy about it and pushes back that you did well in the role that you were in, meaning at the C.F.P.B. And there was just silence in the debate hall when he did it. It underscored what I think has been a theme for Biden in this race and certainly throughout the night when he was present onstage, which is it had this aura of don’t you understand that this is my turn, this is what I’m due? And it reminded me so much of what we would see with Hillary Clinton in 2016.

alexander burns

I think it was also just a total mismanagement by Biden of the dynamics of interacting with an emerging female front-runner in this race. That there was really no need, if you look at the record that he is standing on, for him to then try to sort of take a piece of her signature achievement, the creation of this new regulatory agency. And I think it was a reflection of her sort of lack of interest in escalating a fight with him, her sort of view that it didn’t make sense for her to sort of get into an extended fight with Joe Biden, that she didn’t come back at him harder on that front. It was a real role reversal from what we’ve seen in the race previously, where Joe Biden sort of goes from being the hunted to being the hunter as he sort of loses some traction at the top of this race.

archived recording (joe biden) And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who’s going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how are you going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade. archived recording (anderson cooper) Just to clarify —

michael barbaro

Alex, given the sensitive moment that Joe Biden is in right now with the president’s attacks on him and his son, is there an argument to be made that the best thing that could happen to Biden during this debate was kind of exactly what did happen? That he got to kind of hide away a little bit while all the moderates went after somebody else, Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

I think you can make the case that the best-case scenario for Biden at this point is to sort of protect the base that he has right now, hold steady, and trust the rest of the field to stay fractured. And if that’s the best case for him, then maybe that’s what he did tonight. I think it’s a really, really risky strategy, because it counts on everybody else being ineffective at appealing to the voters who are currently supporting you. So I think you could look at this as a low-risk debate for Biden, where he probably didn’t do damage to himself actively. I think you could also see it as a real missed opportunity for a guy who does have unmatched foreign policy credentials on that stage, who has been victimized by the president in a way that has launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump —

michael barbaro

Right.

alexander burns

— and who didn’t sort of wrap all that together and create a bigger moment for his campaign.

maggie haberman

I totally agree.

michael barbaro

Maggie, Alex, thank you. Good night, slash, good morning. We’ll talk soon.

We’ll be right back.

michael barbaro Are you on deadline? michael schmidt No. michael barbaro Well, I’m looking for someone to tell me what else I need to know today. michael schmidt Um —

michael schmidt

On Tuesday, George Kent, a senior State Department adviser on Ukraine, went up to Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment proceedings. In Kent’s testimony, he says that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told him not to worry about Ukraine policy. Obviously, a little weird for a State Department official who specializes in Ukraine policy.

michael barbaro

The message being, like, we’ve got Ukraine over here at the White House. You at the State Department, that’s not your issue anymore.

michael schmidt

Yet another odd way that the administration was handling its policy towards Ukraine. In the middle of this testimony, Giuliani himself puts out a letter that says that he is not going to comply with a subpoena from the House. The impeachment investigators want to talk to him. Giuliani says, nope, not coming. This is a sham, and he’s not going to participate.

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording (amy robach) If your last name wasn’t Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma? archived recording (hunter biden) I don’t know. I don’t know. Probably not. I don’t think that there’s a lot of things that would have happened in my life that — if my last name wasn’t Biden.

michael schmidt

The other thing you need to know is that Joe Biden’s son Hunter gave an interview with ABC News this morning in which he took on the attacks that Trump has leveled at him about Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And Giuliani.

michael schmidt

Correct, and Giuliani. And he basically said, was it the best thing that I sat on the board of this energy company in Ukraine? Probably not. But he says that these allegations that Giuliani and Trump have thrown at him and thrown at his father about how his dad intervened to help the energy company, it’s all nonsense. There’s nothing to it.

archived recording (hunter biden) You know what? I’m a human. And you know what? Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based upon some un — ethical lapse? Absolutely not.

Warren said that she had nothing against billionaires per se and wasn’t in the demonization business. She was in the justice business. And with her final remarks, she sought to underscore that with praise for a prominent Republican ally of the first President Bush. She also noted that two of her three brothers were Republicans and that she loved them very much.

The third reason I appreciated this debate is because it so perfectly underscored the most prominent candidates’ rationales for running and arguments for themselves. Apart from that odd exchange with Warren, Biden had a decent night, partly because he was given, and took advantage of, several opportunities to stress that he was more prepared for the presidency than anyone else and that the post-Trump era called for someone who wouldn’t have a steep learning curve. The repair work must begin immediately.

Buttigieg made clear that what he offers, at the tender age of 37, is a truly fresh perspective. He had a superb night, because he embraced a role as Warren’s inquisitor and because several supremely eloquent remarks about foreign policy — in particular, about Trump’s withdrawal of American troops from Syria — allowed him to project a command and maturity that some voters needed to see to consider him seriously.

Cory Booker quintupled down on his pitch as the candidate of love — and was so expansively loving to several of the other Democrats, including Kamala Harris and Biden, that I found myself wondering if this debate was a bid to salvage a flagging campaign or the beginning of an audition to be the eventual nominee’s running mate. As for Harris, she had strong moments, but they were neither strong nor frequent enough to alter her fortunes.

This was the most crowded televised presidential debate ever, with 12 candidates, so I’d need the column equivalent of “War and Peace” to appraise all of them. Still I’d feel remiss if I didn’t note that Sanders, who recently suffered a heart attack, seemed no less vigorous than he had before.

But Warren, not Sanders, was carrying the progressive mantle on Tuesday night, when her less liberal competitors sought with a new assertiveness to trip her up. I don’t think that they quite succeeded.

Warren exits this latest debate as strong as she entered it. And those of us who watched it understand her — the calculations behind her positioning, the potential miscalculations of her monumentally expensive plans and the profound conviction she summons — better than ever before. That’s no small payoff for three long hours.

Good morning.

michael barbaro

So believe it or not, with you being in Ohio, me in Washington, and this team of editors and producers in New York, this is not exactly a flawless technical operation at 12:35 a.m.

alexander burns

I have faith in your crack team.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] I have faith too. It’s really the technology I’m beginning to question.

alexander burns

Hmm.

michael barbaro

Hmm. O.K., let’s do this. Alex, if you were going to summarize tonight in a sentence, what would it be?

alexander burns

I think this was the night where you really saw the moderate candidates on stage find their thirst for combat. And I think, interestingly, you saw that displayed not by folks like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar going after Joe Biden, the leading moderate candidate at this point in the race, but you saw it happen by them going after Elizabeth Warren to try to sort of prove their centrist credentials by challenging the left.

michael barbaro

Right. The front-runner who’s not actually quite the front-runner. I checked the polls right before the debate and by all accounts, statistically speaking, that is Joe Biden.

alexander burns

In an average of national polls, Joe Biden has a slight lead over Elizabeth Warren still in this race. But every other candidate in the race can read those trend lines just like we can. She is moving steadily up. He is moving steadily down. And the picture is even more pronounced in the early voting states, like Iowa and New Hampshire. So if you are a Pete Buttigieg or an Amy Klobuchar and you have staked your candidacy on a breakthrough in the Midwest, it is a bigger issue for you to get past Joe Biden and present yourself as a clear, compelling alternative to Elizabeth Warren than it is to go at Joe Biden directly.

michael barbaro

O.K., so let’s talk about how that actually played out.

archived recording (anderson cooper) This is the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate.

maggie haberman

So all 12 candidates are on stage. The debate begins.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support.

maggie haberman

The first question inevitably is about impeachment. This is the first debate since the impeachment inquiry began.

archived recording (anderson cooper) But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.

maggie haberman

And you had all 12 candidates in agreement —

archived recording (bernie sanders) I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment.

maggie haberman

— that they believe that Donald Trump should be impeached.

archived recording (joe biden) They would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.

maggie haberman

This is a big change from where things were within this Democratic field even a month ago.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment.

maggie haberman

And everybody was in unison. They didn’t all necessarily agree that he should be removed from office, but they did agree that he should be impeached.

archived recording (kamala harris) Our framers imagined this moment — a moment where we would have a corrupt president.

michael barbaro

Right. It seemed like every candidate used some version of the phrase “Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country.” It was almost verbatim.

archived recording (joe biden) This president is the most corrupt president in modern history — archived recording (bernie sanders) In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president — archived recording (tom steyer) — most corrupt president in the country. And that only the voice —

maggie haberman

And look, these candidates have generally tried to avoid having these debates be specifically just about Donald Trump. This was among the most Donald Trump-heavy first 10 minutes of a debate that I can recall.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the —

maggie haberman

But instead of using that moment as a way for any of them to sort of use a back door to criticize Joe Biden over the issue related to his son and the work his son had done in Ukraine while Biden was vice president, they all very pointedly, clearly, did not want to join President Trump’s attacks on Joe Biden.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

maggie haberman

None of them brought it up on their own as the debate went on. The rest of the night was really absent any issue related to Biden except for a question from the moderators.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. If it’s not O.K. for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it O.K. for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden? archived recording (joe biden) Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government.

michael barbaro

And everyone seemed quite ready to avoid it and just move on.

alexander burns

Right. And I think that that reflects a couple of things, right?

archived recording (anderson cooper) Senator Sanders, your response? archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me make a point. I think —

alexander burns

The moderators sort of teed up Bernie Sanders, if he wanted to go after Biden on the Hunter Ukraine issue.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured.

alexander burns

Bernie just totally did not take the bait, and neither did anybody else. And part of that is I think a sense among other Democrats that going at the Hunter issue, you really, really risk sort of triggering sympathy for Biden and looking like you are taking Trump’s side in a fight. And I think maybe as big or a bigger part of it is this calculation by a lot of the candidates on stage who want Joe Biden’s supporters to move over to their camp. That the way to do that is not by attacking Joe Biden and that you kind of got to trust that Biden is going to continue sinking in this race just by the force of gravity and his own limitations as a candidate and present yourself as a compelling alternative for people who are looking for a more moderate or a more conventional set of qualifications. And they do that by going after Elizabeth Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — after that. archived recording (marc lacey) Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for “Medicare for all.” You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?

maggie haberman

And you saw that right away with a question about Medicare for all, which she has been facing repeated questions about and people trying to pin her down.

michael barbaro

Right. There’s first an effort by our colleague, Marc Lacey, to twice pin her down on whether or not her Medicare for all plan would require a tax increase for middle-class voters. She doesn’t really answer the yes or no question.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not —

michael barbaro

Then Pete Buttigieg tries to get her to answer it and on and on. And she’s just kind of resolutely unwilling to say yes or no.

alexander burns

And it’s not even really sort of an ideological attack on her, right? You saw Pete Buttigieg pushing her just to sort of be straight on this question.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out —

alexander burns

It’s almost sort of a character attack as much as anything else. She loves talking about the mechanics of policy and where revenue will come from and where it will go and how regulations work and how it will change the way companies are structured. And the fact that this is the one place where she won’t say what we heard Bernie Sanders say —

archived recording (bernie sanders) Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up.

alexander burns

It would be a super sort of Warren-y answer, except she just doesn’t want to give it.

michael barbaro

And why exactly won’t she answer it, Maggie?

maggie haberman

Well, she won’t answer it because there’s not a great answer to the question. Usually when there is not a great answer to the question, you’ll see a politician do what she is doing, which is evade steadfastly.

archived recording (marc lacey) Senator — Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up? archived recording (elizabeth warren) So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind —

maggie haberman

The answer is most likely to be that there will be a tax hike, and that’s not an answer that she wants to be holding herself to right now. I also think that she’s probably leaving herself a little bit of room — emphasis on a little — for a general election on how she might answer this question of a pay-for for this plan. Her opponent, potentially, Donald Trump, is thrilled seeing her talk about this, because Trump and his advisers believe this is going to be an area where they can really push her and try to shove her closer toward the socialist label that he’s been trying to affix to most Democrats.

michael barbaro

And Alex, what did you think was the most notable exchange inside of this first round of efforts by the moderate Democrats on this stage to come after Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

Look, I thought it was the combination of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both speaking about Warren in terms of honesty.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is —

alexander burns

You heard Klobuchar, who has been so careful so far in this race to be very collegial with her Senate colleagues.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that. And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.

alexander burns

You heard her essentially describe Warren’s plans as a pipe dream.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done, and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers —

alexander burns

This is really harsh stuff, right? This is the kind of criticism that you have heard at other points in the race directed at Joe Biden.

maggie haberman

One thing, too, that I was struck by in Klobuchar’s answer is she more than once said that essentially, to Warren, your way of doing things is not the only way.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t —

michael barbaro

And does that reflect some kind of larger sentiment among these moderate candidates about Warren and about the way that she campaigns?

alexander burns

I think it reflects a resentment among some of the more moderate candidates of the way Warren argues sometimes explicitly, sometimes a little bit more subtly, that if you don’t approach policy the same way she does, it’s because you don’t have political guts. You don’t have grit. You’re not willing to fight —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we’ve — archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — got to stop —

alexander burns

For somebody like Amy Klobuchar, she sees how you get stuff done in government differently. She doesn’t think it makes her a coward. She thinks it sort of just reflects a different set of political values.

michael barbaro

So what’s the next notable exchange?

archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Congressman. archived recording (erin burnett) Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate.

alexander burns

You have this even messier multi-candidate pile-on around Warren’s proposal for a tax on huge private fortunes.

archived recording (erin burnett) Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.

alexander burns

That it sort of begins with this exchange involving Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, the only billionaire on stage, where —

archived recording (erin burnett) What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

alexander burns

— I think there’s an attempt by the moderators to try to draw out Steyer in a way that would maybe stir some tension on stage. And he basically says, look —

archived recording (tom steyer) Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor.

alexander burns

— wealth concentration is a problem. Then the spotlight moves back to some of those moderates we talked about before.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) This is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — to who sounded better on a debate stage — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. archived recording (pete buttigieg) — debate stage or in a committee hearing — archived recording (erin burnett) Senator Klobuchar — Senator Klobuchar — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — versus what it’s actually going to take to get something done. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I want to give a reality che — archived recording (erin burnett) Will a wealth tax work? archived recording (amy klobuchar) It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

alexander burns

You hear Amy Klobuchar not attacking the idea of a wealth tax — she says that she’s open to the idea — but again criticizing Warren for this sense that Warren thinks her ideas are the only good ideas.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that, after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.

alexander burns

Nobody is actually challenging the substance of her policy idea here. And in fact, you hear people across the ideological spectrum in the party either endorsing a wealth tax or at least indicating their openness to a wealth tax.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

alexander burns

So to me, this part is more of a primal scream of frustration towards Elizabeth Warren than a really concerted policy challenge.

michael barbaro

And when you say primal scream of frustration, I’m guessing you don’t just mean the fact that they think she talks about her ideas as if they are the best and the only good ideas, but perhaps because she’s just doing really well?

alexander burns

She is doing really well, right? That if you look back to where this race was when Beto O’Rourke got into it, right, back in the late winter or early spring, he was one of the leading candidates. Elizabeth Warren was at the back of the polls and struggling to sort of find two dimes to rub together for her campaign, right? Now she is one of the biggest fundraisers in the field. He is at the back of the pack, struggling to survive. And you do see — you saw it earlier in the race with Joe Biden. You see it now with Elizabeth Warren. People who are polling towards the back of the pack, trying to have some kind of impact in this race, go after the front-runner.

archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Senator Booker. archived recording (anderson cooper) We’ve got to take a quick break. We’ve got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio. We’ll be right back after this. [APPLAUSE]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording (anderson cooper) And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered —

michael barbaro

So as this debate went on, it felt like we saw the first substantive conversation on foreign policy that I can remember from these Democratic debates, in part, I think, because of the urgency of the situation that’s playing out in Syria. I wonder if it felt that way to both of you.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Vice President Biden, we —

maggie haberman

It didn’t feel that substantive to me, candidly. It felt urgent, and it felt emotional.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership.

maggie haberman

What I think was striking about it is that Joe Biden, who was vice president, seemed to really struggle in his answer to this question about what he would do and what he thought was necessary.

archived recording (joe biden) What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where — he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real locked-down conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now. Pay that price.

maggie haberman

I think that Biden still sounded as if he wasn’t quite sure what to do. And I really thought going into this debate that this was going to be an issue that Biden was going to score lots of points on, because it’s right in his wheelhouse.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s one of the ways that Biden has tried to distinguish himself, by pointing to his experience and his gravitas, especially around matters like foreign policy and military conflict.

archived recording (joe biden) I think I may be — doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan.

alexander burns

Right. You heard him make that argument quite explicitly, that he’s the one person on stage who needs no on-the-job training, that he has dealt with Putin, he has dealt with Erdogan directly. What he struggles with, as Maggie was saying, is communicating that in a way that conveys a sense of command and reassurance to the people who are watching the debate. I did think there were at least the germs of a bigger ideological argument about foreign policy.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this —

alexander burns

You did hear a pretty stark difference between Biden, on the one hand, who, not in a terribly articulate way, talked about keeping American troops in Syria in some fashion, and Elizabeth Warren saying quite directly that she wants to get rid of those troops, just not in the way Donald Trump has gone about doing it.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to get — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no — archived recording (anderson cooper) Yeah. Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — military solution — archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor Buttigieg? archived recording (elizabeth warren) — in this region.

michael barbaro

And Alex, does that ideological breakdown, when it comes to how the United States should use military forces, does that fall along familiar domestic debate ideological fault lines? Or is it different?

alexander burns

It doesn’t map precisely onto the same fault lines as domestic policy, economic policy, health care. But I do think that the more populist wing of the party represented by Warren and Sanders and a couple other people intermittently onstage is much more skeptical of the idea of the United States being involved in foreign wars, of having permanent troop presence overseas. And it is something, Michael, as you obviously recall, that the president played to quite effectively in 2016, is this idea that there actua — there may be a consensus in Washington for the United States to play this kind of role in foreign countries, but in the rest of America, there’s a lot of exhaustion and a lot of skepticism. And that’s part of what I think was so challenging for Biden in this moment, right? That just talking about restoring the bipartisan foreign policy consensus isn’t necessarily super compelling to base primary voters, at least the ones who are voting on foreign policy.

archived recording (anderson cooper) As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.

michael barbaro

So toward the end of the debate, the moderators asked this question that sort of seems to be pointed directly at this central tension that’s been playing out on stage.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump? archived recording (joe biden) Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people.

michael barbaro

I wonder what you make of the answers to that question.

alexander burns

Well, first, I think it’s really striking that the question needed to be asked in this specific way in order to draw Biden into conflict with Warren and Sanders. In past debates, he’s been so eager to go after them on a whole range of policies. In this debate, there were big sections of the night where he seemed to really fade from the foreground of this thing. And the moderators really sort of summon him to rise to this moment as a champion of the center in this race.

archived recording (joe biden) I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done.

He does it by describing himself as the only person on the stage who’s ever gotten big things done. He talks about the Violence Against Women Act. He talks about the Affordable Care Act. And he runs pretty quickly into quite a challenging confrontation with both Bernie Sanders and Warren.

maggie haberman

— gets unhappy about it and pushes back that you did well in the role that you were in, meaning at the C.F.P.B. And there was just silence in the debate hall when he did it. It underscored what I think has been a theme for Biden in this race and certainly throughout the night when he was present onstage, which is it had this aura of don’t you understand that this is my turn, this is what I’m due? And it reminded me so much of what we would see with Hillary Clinton in 2016.

alexander burns

I think it was also just a total mismanagement by Biden of the dynamics of interacting with an emerging female front-runner in this race. That there was really no need, if you look at the record that he is standing on, for him to then try to sort of take a piece of her signature achievement, the creation of this new regulatory agency. And I think it was a reflection of her sort of lack of interest in escalating a fight with him, her sort of view that it didn’t make sense for her to sort of get into an extended fight with Joe Biden, that she didn’t come back at him harder on that front. It was a real role reversal from what we’ve seen in the race previously, where Joe Biden sort of goes from being the hunted to being the hunter as he sort of loses some traction at the top of this race.

archived recording (joe biden) And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who’s going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how are you going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade. archived recording (anderson cooper) Just to clarify —

michael barbaro

Alex, given the sensitive moment that Joe Biden is in right now with the president’s attacks on him and his son, is there an argument to be made that the best thing that could happen to Biden during this debate was kind of exactly what did happen? That he got to kind of hide away a little bit while all the moderates went after somebody else, Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

I think you can make the case that the best-case scenario for Biden at this point is to sort of protect the base that he has right now, hold steady, and trust the rest of the field to stay fractured. And if that’s the best case for him, then maybe that’s what he did tonight. I think it’s a really, really risky strategy, because it counts on everybody else being ineffective at appealing to the voters who are currently supporting you. So I think you could look at this as a low-risk debate for Biden, where he probably didn’t do damage to himself actively. I think you could also see it as a real missed opportunity for a guy who does have unmatched foreign policy credentials on that stage, who has been victimized by the president in a way that has launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump —

On Tuesday, George Kent, a senior State Department adviser on Ukraine, went up to Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment proceedings. In Kent’s testimony, he says that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told him not to worry about Ukraine policy. Obviously, a little weird for a State Department official who specializes in Ukraine policy.

michael barbaro

The message being, like, we’ve got Ukraine over here at the White House. You at the State Department, that’s not your issue anymore.

michael schmidt

Yet another odd way that the administration was handling its policy towards Ukraine. In the middle of this testimony, Giuliani himself puts out a letter that says that he is not going to comply with a subpoena from the House. The impeachment investigators want to talk to him. Giuliani says, nope, not coming. This is a sham, and he’s not going to participate.

The other thing you need to know is that Joe Biden’s son Hunter gave an interview with ABC News this morning in which he took on the attacks that Trump has leveled at him about Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And Giuliani.

michael schmidt

Correct, and Giuliani. And he basically said, was it the best thing that I sat on the board of this energy company in Ukraine? Probably not. But he says that these allegations that Giuliani and Trump have thrown at him and thrown at his father about how his dad intervened to help the energy company, it’s all nonsense. There’s nothing to it.

That’s how the contenders for the party’s nomination framed the recent withdrawal of American troops from northern Syria under President Trump, who they said during Tuesday night’s debate had created turmoil with his impulsive foreign policy decision making.

“It’s been the most shameful thing any president has done in modern history in terms of foreign policy,” former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said.

While Democrats have been consumed with the Trump administration’s dealings with Russia and Ukraine, the emerging foreign policy crisis in Syria presented a delicate test for the party’s presidential hopefuls on the debate stage.

It followed Mr. Trump’s decision this month to withdraw American troops from northern Syria, one that has been sharply criticized by Republicans and now Democrats, who said it would endanger Kurdish allies in the region. Mr. Trump said he was trying to “end the endless wars.”"

Ukraine was just another country in Eastern Europe, and the House had not begun its impeachment inquiry.

That debate, held Sept. 12 in Houston, was the first time in the 2020 race that the Democratic candidates faced off on one night instead of being split into two evenings. It was also the first time that two of the leading contenders, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren, were onstage together.

For many young, progressive Americans, democratic socialism is a far better representation of their ambitions of far-reaching structural change across the economy and society than the agenda of the Democratic Party, which they see as overly influenced by corporate interests, big-money donors and moderate traditionalists.

The attempt at Ohio State to define objectives also comes as the Democratic presidential contenders are locked in a battle over what direction the party should take in order to win in 2020. That dynamic will be on display Tuesday night less than 15 miles from O.S.U., when the candidates gather for the fourth primary debate at Otterbein University in Westerville.

Two top candidates, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have successfully pushed the primary conversation to the left. The D.S.A. saw drastic growth in its membership when Mr. Sanders, himself a democratic socialist, ran for president in 2016, and there are now nearly 60,000 members across the country. (Ms. Warren, who has pulled ahead of Mr. Sanders in polling and is a leading candidate for the nomination, backs many of the same progressive priorities as Mr. Sanders, but has also said she is “a capitalist to my bones.”)"

“It’s not lost on people that many of these candidates were actually on the record supporting impeachment before anyone was even talking about Ukraine,” said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and former Trump White House official.

The debate, held outside Columbus, Ohio, allowed Republicans to try to make their case in a state that Mr. Trump won by eight percentage points in 2016 and has many of the middle-class, blue-collar voters that he hopes to turn out again in next year’s election. To underscore the point, the Trump campaign took out a full-page ad in the Columbus Dispatch on Tuesday that blared, “Democrats Will Kill Ohio Jobs … President Trump’s Fighting for the Economy.”

The president remains historically unpopular, however. The Gallup presidential approval poll has measured public support for his job performance at below 50 percent for his entire presidency. To overcome this skepticism, Republicans have attempted to define the Democrats as out of touch and too far to the left of where most Americans’ views are. Some of the Democratic candidates, like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., hold moderate and liberal views, while Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont are generally more progressive.

Senator Marco Rubio of Florida on Wednesday expressed the kind of binary argument that Republicans hope prevails on voters. “Last night’s debate was a reminder that while you may not always agree with everything Trump says or does, the leading alternatives to Trump mock people with traditional beliefs & support socialism, gun confiscation & free government funded health care for unlawful immigrants,” he wrote on Twitter.

With Ms. Warren the target of sustained attacks from the other Democrats onstage, Mr. Trump and his Republican allies moved to frame the race around the question of whether voters want a strongly liberal president and government in 2021.

On Tuesday night, after Mr. Sanders picked up the support of two high-profile liberals in the House Democratic caucus — Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar — Republicans jumped at the chance to make them a focal point in the morning-after debate analysis. The two freshmen are a favorite target of conservatives, who have caricatured them as the true leaders of their party."

(They also made a quiz on the 2020 campaign so far, if you’re into that.)

Here are the biggest takeaways for those of us watching from the Golden State:

There were two Californians onstage, Senator Kamala Harris and the billionaire Tom Steyer, who lives in San Francisco. How did they do?

This was Mr. Steyer’s first time on a presidential debate stage, and he spent much of his seven minutes and 13 seconds of speaking time introducing himself and his ideas.

Yes, he acknowledged, he is a very rich guy. But as a longtime Democratic donor who has pushed for impeachment for years, he sought to position himself as the best person to expose what he described as the president’s failures.

And asked whether billionaires should be taxed out of existence, he answered yes without hesitation. He also railed against a government that he said has been bought by big corporations."

So I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.”

Many Democratic strategists and officials have warned that the scrutiny on the Biden family has become a significant distraction for the former vice president, and poses perhaps the greatest threat yet to a candidacy that until recent weeks was well ahead in the polls. That makes it all the more urgent for Mr. Biden to land the kind of consistently fluent, forceful debate performance that has so far eluded him at a moment when Senator Elizabeth Warren has now surpassed him in some polls, Democratic operatives and activists said.

“I’m never a distraction to my dad, but as it relates to actually going and being onstage with him — this is not a family business,” Hunter Biden said Tuesday in the ABC interview, which aired on “Good Morning America’’ and was also excerpted online by the network. “Everybody kind of thinks that somehow, whether it’s a compliment that we’re like the Kennedys or whether it’s a, you know, backhanded compliment like you’re the Trumps, my dad has a, a job, but that does not mean that I have had any plans to go do rallies and, you know and, you know, talk about Donald Trump’s kids and I never will, you know, that’s not what Bidens do.”

At a news conference on Sunday, however, his father did appear to take some oblique swipes at the ethical practices of members of the Trump family, some of whom who have conducted their own overseas business dealings. And Hunter Biden seemed to be dismissive of Donald Trump Jr., who along with his father and brother have been highly critical of the Bidens.

“Donald Prince Humperdinck, um, Trump, Jr., is not somebody I really care about,” he said, an apparent reference to a character in the movie “The Princess Bride.”

In the interview, Hunter Biden signaled that by backing away from foreign dealings, he hoped to eliminate the controversy as a campaign issue for his father.

“I’m taking it off the table,” he said. “I’m making that commitment. Let’s see if anybody else makes that commitment. But that’s the commitment that I’m making.”"

At the same time, others like Ms. Gabbard, have been careful to endorse only the impeachment inquiry and not necessarily impeachment itself.

Below is a partial transcript of the exchange on impeachment at Tuesday night’s Democratic debate:

WARREN: Sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics. I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry. When I made the decision to run for president, I certainly didn’t think it was going to be about impeachment. But when the Mueller report came out, I read it, all 442 pages. And when I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown ... that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly. And so at that moment, I called for opening an impeachment inquiry. Now, that didn’t happen and look what happened as a result. Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke it again this fall.

You know, we took a constitutional oath, and that is that no one is above the law, and that includes the President of the United States. Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences. This is about Donald Trump. But understand, it’s about the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country. The impeachment must go forward.

ANDERSON COOPER: Thank you, Senator Warren. You’re all going to get in on this, by the way. Senator Sanders, do Democrats have any choice but to impeach? Please respond."

“Oh my,” Patti Solis Doyle, who served as Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager in 2008, remarked when the figures were first posted on Twitter.

Mr. Biden’s treasury now ranks fifth in the Democratic field, also behind Senator Kamala Harris of California, who had $10.5 million in the bank, though her $911,000 in unpaid bills — to her pollster, media buyer and lawyers, among others — meant that her functional cash on hand was closer to $9.6 million. (Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg reported no debts.)

The self-funding billionaire Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July and reported spending $47 million , also has more financial resources than Mr. Biden heading toward the Iowa caucuses, which are less than four months away.

Mr. Biden’s team has steadfastly said that it has enough cash to run the campaign it wants, and recently announced plans to spend $6 million on digital and television ads in the coming months.

“The fundamental question about fund-raising is: Do you have what you need to run your race? And we do,” said Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden.

On Friday, Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, Greg Schultz, scheduled a conference call with the campaign’s donors, presumably to reassure them about the path forward. Top fund-raisers for Mr. Biden recently gathered in Philadelphia for a full day of briefings on Mr. Biden’s strategy through Super Tuesday in early March."

Seven in 10 Democratic voters support mandatory buybacks, according to an August Quinnipiac poll, although less than half of all voters do.

There is a similar lack of consensus among the Democratic candidates on whether to force all gun owners to register their weapons in a national database. Democratic politicians long dismissed the idea of a gun registry as a fear-mongering tactic from the National Rifle Association, but it now enjoys broad support from the public: 62 percent of Americans back the idea, including 85 percent of Democrats.

Most candidates now favor establishing a registry, though some — including Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. — do not. Others, like Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, say it should apply only to owners of assault weapons.

Climate Change









Democratic voters widely believe that climate change represents an international emergency — 84 percent said so in the August Quinnipiac poll — and roughly nine in 10 think the United States is not doing enough to address global warming.

All the major Democratic candidates have expressed support for the Green New Deal, though some have been more guarded than others. All five senators who will debate Tuesday night co-sponsored the bill. Mr. Buttigieg has simply called it “the right beginning,” while Mr. Biden’s campaign website endorses it as a “crucial framework.”

But the Green New Deal enjoys broad support from the American public, with 63 percent of respondents to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll in July saying they like the idea of investing government money to fund sustainable infrastructure projects and green jobs.

There is an Elizabeth Warren constituency that has expanded swiftly enough, especially in early states, to make her arguably the front-runner. There is a Bernie Sanders constituency that is about two-thirds the size of Warren’s and Biden’s peak and seemingly stuck there. And then, way down at around 5 percent and under, there is everybody else.

So a big question in this debate and in the ones before Iowa arrives and the also-rans begin to be formally run out is whether Democratic voters can be persuaded to reconsider this consolidation. And last night there were only really two candidates who presented themselves as plausible vehicles for that reconsideration: Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar.

As for the others — well, Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard are too niche, Beto O’Rourke is too limp, Julián Castro is too forgettable and Tom Steyer is too absurd. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker should be contenders, but Booker manages to be appealing at every debate without quite finding a rationale for his candidacy, while Harris has been on a weird self-destruct mission ever since her brief ascent — with her strange fight with Warren last night over whether Twitter should ban Donald Trump a particularly peculiar self-charted nose-dive."

Gail: I do want to get to the Democrats but first one more quick question. Are you still staying off the impeachment wagon?

Bret: Wavering. A few of my arguments against impeachment no longer look as good to me now as they did two weeks ago. Public sentiment in favor of the inquiry is growing, even among a few Republicans, which makes the impeachment process itself less likely to be a purely partisan process. The evidence of presidential malfeasance is also growing. That’s an argument to let the process continue, see what we learn and keep an open mind. And if the impeachment process really wounds Trump, it might invite a really serious Republican primary challenge.

But I still have my doubts. …

Bret: You know I’ve been partial to Pete Buttigieg. Part of his problem is that his performances are so polished that too many people fail to notice how consistently and brightly he shines. And I think there’s a potentially winning lane for him if Joe Biden fades as the leading moderate in the race.

Gail: I can definitely imagine Buttigieg being the Democratic nominee down the road — in another four or eight or 12 years. And I think it’s very smart for him to be running, introducing himself to the public and ratcheting up his profile.

Focusing only on taxes is pointless. But in a larger way, she’s wrong.

The No. 1 reason to question her version of Medicare for All — in which private health insurance would be eliminated — is its political viability. It would be an enormous disruption to the health care system, and history shows that health care disruptions are very hard to pass and usually unpopular at first. Polls show that her plan is already unpopular, and it would be a bigger disruption than Obamacare or Bill Clinton’s failed plan.

Given all that, she needs to engage with the political realities — with how she would overcome people’s resistance to giving up their health insurance for a larger new program that, yes, would require a tax increase.

I think Warren has run an excellent campaign on the whole, and I think she has the most thoughtful agenda for addressing the stagnating living standards of most Americans. I’m surprised that she has chosen to focus so much of her candidacy on the most aggressive version of Medicare for All. But she has. Now it’s time for her to tell voters how she will deal with the politics of passing it.

In my view, her best answer involves finding a way to signal her openness to a transition, in which people who want to keep their private insurance can do so (and taxes don’t yet need to rise) while Medicare initially expands voluntarily. That idea is hugely popular."

Eighty percent of white workers said their managers were white, while 38 percent of nonwhite workers had a manager of the same race. The results were based on a subset of 20,400 survey respondents from 81 of the nation’s largest retail and food service companies.

The researchers used a novel technique to find survey takers: They placed ads on Facebook. The full sample is of workers at 120 of the largest retail and food service companies in the United States, industries that employ one-fifth of American workers. It is not a random sample, but they said it is reflective of the retail and food service work force. It is much larger than any other survey of this group of workers and provides more fine-grained data. Social scientists not involved in the research said it was carefully done and convincing.

Two-thirds of workers said they received less than two weeks’ notice of their schedules, and 15 percent had less than 72 hours of notice. Eighty percent said they had little or no input into their schedules. A third said they wanted more hours than they were assigned.

Not knowing when they will work worsens the challenges of people living on a low income, the survey found.

Over all, hourly workers described going hungry, not being able to pay bills, scrambling to arrange child care, losing housing, losing sleep and feeling stressed and unhealthy. But those with unpredictable schedules were twice as likely to report hardships as those with stable schedules — even when they earned the same wages, worked the same number of hours and had the same employers.

Re “Race Takes Turn as Warren Faces Barrage Onstage” (front page, Oct. 16):

After watching all the Democratic debates, I am left with the following sentiments that I believe are shared by many Democrats:

My heart is with Bernie Sanders because what he says about America and what needs to be done is absolutely true. My head is with Elizabeth Warren because she is Bernie lite, a progressive who is more electable than Bernie since she is less scary to suburban Republicans and independents. And my fear puts me with Uncle Joe, because he may be most likely to beat President Trump in the swing Rust Belt states, and the thought of four more years of Trumpism is unspeakable.

But I felt the same way about Hillary Clinton and look how that turned out.

The others do nothing for this 65-year-old longtime Democrat. So how do I vote? I don’t know.

The big talking points from last night

Candidates were pressed on a number of issues at last night’s Democratic presidential debate. But the standout moments involved topics close to the business community.

On health care:

• Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has moved to the top of some polls, faced more criticism about her universal health care proposal than she has in the past.

• Mayor Pete Buttigieg told Ms. Warren he didn’t understand “why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans.”"

He rebuked Representative Tulsi Gabbard on foreign policy. And, most notably, he engaged in the most substantive and sustained contrast of any candidate yet with Ms. Warren.

It was Mr. Buttigieg’s exchange with Ms. Warren over “Medicare for all” that was most memorable, pressing her as she declined to say, yet again, whether her plan would require a middle-class tax increase. (She says her plan would curb middle-class “costs.”)

“A yes-or-no question that did not get a yes-or-no answer,” Mr. Buttigieg said, adding, “Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this.” He rattled off how her plan would “obliterate” the private health insurance of 150 million Americans while pitching his “Medicare for all who want it” alternative.

Mr. Buttigieg’s rebuke of Mr. O’Rourke — “I don’t need lessons from you on courage” — may lend itself more to a viral moment. But the bigger leap was to be seen as a foil to Ms. Warren.

It felt at times on Tuesday as if the sprawling 12-person stage had actually narrowed to a four-person debate, with Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders representing the left, and Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg representing the center-left. The occasional television shot of just those four served to hammer home the point."

Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage. What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

STEYER: First of all, let me say this. Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor. And the results are as shameful as Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income. It’s absolutely wrong. It’s absolutely undemocratic and unfair. I was one of the first people on this stage to propose a wealth tax. I would undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations. But there’s something else going on here that is absolutely shameful, and that’s the way the money gets split up in terms of earnings. As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor, people haven’t had a raise — 90 percent of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years.

If you took the minimum wage from 1980 and just adjusted it for inflation, you get 11 bucks. It’s seven and a quarter. If you included productivity gains of American workers, it would be over 20 bucks. There’s something wrong here. And that is that the corporations have bought our government. Our government has failed. That’s why I’m running for president. Because we’re not going to get any of the policies that everybody on this stage wants — health care, education, Green New Deal or a living wage — unless we break the power of these corporations.

BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Vice President Biden, you have warned against demonizing rich people. Do you believe that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren’s wealth tax plans do that?

BIDEN: No, look. Demonizing wealth — what I talked about is how you get things done. And the way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now. The idea — we have to start rewarding work, not just wealth. I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate of 39.5 percent. I would double it. Because guess what? Why in God’s name should someone who is clipping coupons in the stock market pay a lower tax rate than someone who in fact is, like I said — a schoolteacher and a firefighter? It’s ridiculous, and they pay a lower tax. Secondly, the idea that we, in fact, engage in this notion that there are — there’s $1.64 trillion in tax loopholes. You can’t justify at minimum $600 billion of that. We could eliminate it all. I could go into detail had I the time. Secondly — thirdly — what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the American people that we are going to raise taxes on the wealthy. We are going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not. This is one of the reasons why these debates are kind of crazy. Because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given. The fact is, everybody is right about the fact that the fourth industrial revolution is costing jobs. It is. The fact is also corporate greed, if they’re going back and not investing in their employees, they’re reinvesting in buying back their stock."

Tonight, 12 Democratic candidates will be debating near Columbus, Ohio. Here’s what I’ll be looking for from the seven candidates with the best chances of winning the nomination:

Elizabeth Warren. Swing voters exist, and they are likely to decide the 2020 election, much as they played a decisive role in 2016 and 2018. So far, Warren has not worried much about appealing to them. Now that she’s the front-runner, can she begin to signal to Democrats that she wants to be ruthless about beating President Trump?

Joe Biden. He has yet to seem sharp for an entire debate. Can he break that streak and alleviate concerns about his ability to withstand a long, vicious campaign? I’m more interested in that than the narrow questions of how he responds to Trump’s false smears against his family.

Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. They are the best-positioned candidates to benefit from Biden’s uneven campaign and win over more moderate Democrats. Can any of the three make an explicit case: I’m stronger than Biden and more electable than Warren?"

A majority of Americans want to uphold Roe v. Wade, but a longstanding 80 percent of them support restrictions of some kind (according to 2019 Gallup polling), most notably in the third trimester (as of 2018 Gallup polling, 65 percent support restrictions in second trimester as well). Only Senator Amy Klobuchar and Ms. Gabbard have admitted to supporting third-trimester restrictions. The rest, including the current front-runners Senator Elizabeth Warren and the former vice president Joe Biden, have offered rare consideration for restrictions or conversation around why such large portions of the country support them.

Abortion and reproductive rights may not be a “deal breaker” vote for swing voters, as a recent Fox News poll revealed, but it is an issue that matters deeply to them, especially those who hold faith in high regard. More to the point, it’s curious that so many Democratic candidates hold a view consistent with so few voters. No one should swap genuine beliefs about abortion to appease polling numbers, but if these candidates represent the American people, they are statistically divergent from them in a dramatic way. This may mean a few of them are hiding their authentic beliefs about abortion for political safety — but that’s to their detriment.

The answer for candidates isn’t necessarily changing policy positions but offering room for conversation with those who support restrictions and respect for an alternative position that is rooted in genuine beliefs about the origins of life.

Even Mr. Biden, viewed as a moderate, has disappointed on the issue, reversing his long-held position on banning federal funds for abortion. This has damaged his “moderate” brand slightly. He has also given into relentless badgering from progressives, endorsing the Green New Deal and bowing to liberal sexual politics with his recent announcement that he would support men who identify as women being housed with females in prison.

All of this leftward marching, for Mr. Biden and others, moves candidates further from potential voters it’s necessary to win over. These folks may not vote for Mr. Trump (or vote at all), but Democrats stand to lose this opening with them for good. Now is the time to put formerly Republican voters on notice, as Ms. Gabbard has done with her distinctive approach.

They crave the anti-Trump, not a hypocritical Kamala Harris and her indefensible record on criminal justice. Ms. Harris describes herself as a “progressive prosecutor,” but infamously upheld multiple wrongful conviction cases and failed to support a ballot initiative that would reduce penalties for nonviolent crimes. These voters also have little interest in an opportunistic Mayor Pete Buttigieg: For years in Indiana politics, he worked “cordially” with Mike Pence, then the governor, but only since becoming a rising star in the Democratic Party has the mayor chosen to demean Mr. Pence’s religious beliefs.

In the first exchange, Ms. Warren, who is from Massachusetts, was asked repeatedly how she would pay for “Medicare for all” and insisted that costs would not increase for middle-class Americans. But she would not say outright that taxes would or would not increase.

Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who has championed a single-payer system, said taxes would go up for “virtually everybody.” But he added that the tax increase would be substantially less than what people currently pay for premiums and out-of-pocket health care expenses.

Biden Jr. escalated his criticism of his most formidable rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, suggesting that she was not being forthright about the costs of her far-reaching policy proposals and questioning her “credibility.”

Mr. Biden zeroed in on Ms. Warren’s refusal to say if she would raise taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for “Medicare for all,” a single-payer health care system that would all but eliminate private health insurance. While other candidates are pouncing on that issue as well, Mr. Biden is under particular pressure because Ms. Warren has passed him in some national and early-state polls and joined him as a front-runner, a status he held alone for months.

“It’s fascinating that the person who has a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential issue in this election in the minds of the American people across the board,” Mr. Biden said, addressing reporters on a cold, gray afternoon outside a union electrical trade center."

But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists and consultants from both parties.

Here is a sampling of their reactions.

Warren took fire from all sides

The strategists agreed on one thing: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s new front-runner status was clear, because she was everyone else’s biggest target. But they were divided on how well she handled the attacks.

“Warren took almost everyone’s best punch there & came away basically unscathed.” — Jesse Lehrich, former foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton “Heading into this debate as a frontrunner, she did not seem ready for the incoming.” — Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and former Democratic National Committee spokesman “This is the @ewarren debate. You might be happy or sad about it, but she’s the one who is setting the tone and she’s the reference point for most of the other candidates. That happens to the frontrunner.” — Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics

Buttigieg stood out …

Several consultants said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., had successfully set himself up as an alternative for moderate Democrats uneasy with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They particularly liked his responses on foreign policy, which he framed in terms of his own experience in the military.

“Very strong, passionate and compelling condemnation of @realDonaldTrump betrayal of Kurds from Northern Syria by @PeteButtigieg. Owning this discussion.” — David Axelrod, former chief strategist for Barack Obama “I am impressed with Buttigieg on foreign policy. Like Biden, he really shines and opens up when he talks about FP.” — Jess Morales Rocketto, political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance “This has been @PeteButtigieg’s best #DemDebate performance so far. While other candidates tried to out-left and anti-Trump each other, Mayor Pete came across as reasonable and rational.” — Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster

… and so did Klobuchar

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota received similarly positive reviews, with strategists arguing that she and Mr. Buttigieg in the middle against Ms. Warren on the left was the biggest dynamic of the night.

“@amyklobuchar performance tonight will resonate with moderate Democrats who are tired of being told that they are sellouts if they don’t subscribe to most left views. It’s a theme that’s cut across all her answers tonight & why she is having a good night.” — Jennifer Palmieri, former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama “With 11 other people on stage, you don’t get a lot of opportunities to make an impression. But she’s finding them, using each one to stand out and draw a contrast.” — Mo Elleithee “Every time Amy Klobuchar speaks she says something sensible. Not sure that makes her electable, but it’s nice to hear.” — Joe Lockhart, former spokesman for President Bill Clinton

Sanders was reassuring

After his heart attack two weeks ago, Senator Bernie Sanders badly needed to project strength and stamina, and on the whole, the consensus was that he succeeded.

“What heart attack?! @BernieSanders is giving a strong performance and not missing a step.” — Patti Solis Doyle, senior adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign “Bernie Sanders making a damn important point here — stuff in our county was bad before Trump was elected, and this election has to be about more than defeating Trump.” — Sally Kohn, progressive commentator and former campaign strategist “This was @BernieSanders’ best debate by far, but I still don’t hear him making a pitch to people who don’t already support him.” — Laura Belin, Iowa political commentator

Biden had an uneven performance

Mr. Biden won praise for his responses on foreign policy — frequently a strong area for him — but was criticized for seeming to claim credit for Ms. Warren’s work establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

“Biden needs to have a clear and compelling response to the Trump charge against him and his son, and I assumed he would have prepared one, but his answer is not sharp. When asked ‘did you make a mistake?’ he snaps back with a much sharper line.” — Robert Reich, professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and former labor secretary No one more experienced on foreign policy on this debate stage than @JoeBiden. This is where his experience shines and reminds voters that experience does matter.” — Adrienne Elrod, former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton “Biden yelling ‘I GOT you votes’ at Warren is not the best look.” — Kelly Dittmar, scholar at Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics

Other standout moments

Several other candidates got good reviews for specific answers: Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker on reproductive rights, and the former housing secretary Julián Castro for the statement, “Police violence is also gun violence.”

“Such a smart move by @KamalaHarris to refocus the conversation on women’s reproductive rights. She listened to women since the last debate and will gain attention and praise for it.” — Kelly Dittmar “@CoryBooker brings a lot to this primary, but perhaps his greatest debate contribution is his continuance to be the moral compass, reminding candidates and the audience what this campaign is really all about: defeating Trump and helping people live better lives.” — Adrienne Elrod “Castro was really strong on police violence there and brought in an angle on seizing guns that other candidates missed.” — Seth Masket, political scientist at the University of Denver

alexander burns

Hmm.

michael barbaro

Hmm. O.K., let’s do this. Alex, if you were going to summarize tonight in a sentence, what would it be?

alexander burns

I think this was the night where you really saw the moderate candidates on stage find their thirst for combat. And I think, interestingly, you saw that displayed not by folks like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar going after Joe Biden, the leading moderate candidate at this point in the race, but you saw it happen by them going after Elizabeth Warren to try to sort of prove their centrist credentials by challenging the left.

michael barbaro

Right. The front-runner who’s not actually quite the front-runner. I checked the polls right before the debate and by all accounts, statistically speaking, that is Joe Biden.

alexander burns

In an average of national polls, Joe Biden has a slight lead over Elizabeth Warren still in this race. But every other candidate in the race can read those trend lines just like we can. She is moving steadily up. He is moving steadily down. And the picture is even more pronounced in the early voting states, like Iowa and New Hampshire. So if you are a Pete Buttigieg or an Amy Klobuchar and you have staked your candidacy on a breakthrough in the Midwest, it is a bigger issue for you to get past Joe Biden and present yourself as a clear, compelling alternative to Elizabeth Warren than it is to go at Joe Biden directly.

michael barbaro

O.K., so let’s talk about how that actually played out.

archived recording (anderson cooper) This is the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate.

maggie haberman

So all 12 candidates are on stage. The debate begins.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support.

maggie haberman

The first question inevitably is about impeachment. This is the first debate since the impeachment inquiry began.

archived recording (anderson cooper) But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.

maggie haberman

And you had all 12 candidates in agreement —

archived recording (bernie sanders) I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment.

maggie haberman

— that they believe that Donald Trump should be impeached.

archived recording (joe biden) They would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.

maggie haberman

This is a big change from where things were within this Democratic field even a month ago.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment.

maggie haberman

And everybody was in unison. They didn’t all necessarily agree that he should be removed from office, but they did agree that he should be impeached.

archived recording (kamala harris) Our framers imagined this moment — a moment where we would have a corrupt president.

michael barbaro

Right. It seemed like every candidate used some version of the phrase “Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country.” It was almost verbatim.

archived recording (joe biden) This president is the most corrupt president in modern history — archived recording (bernie sanders) In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president — archived recording (tom steyer) — most corrupt president in the country. And that only the voice —

maggie haberman

And look, these candidates have generally tried to avoid having these debates be specifically just about Donald Trump. This was among the most Donald Trump-heavy first 10 minutes of a debate that I can recall.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the —

maggie haberman

But instead of using that moment as a way for any of them to sort of use a back door to criticize Joe Biden over the issue related to his son and the work his son had done in Ukraine while Biden was vice president, they all very pointedly, clearly, did not want to join President Trump’s attacks on Joe Biden.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

maggie haberman

None of them brought it up on their own as the debate went on. The rest of the night was really absent any issue related to Biden except for a question from the moderators.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. If it’s not O.K. for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it O.K. for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden? archived recording (joe biden) Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government.

michael barbaro

And everyone seemed quite ready to avoid it and just move on.

alexander burns

Right. And I think that that reflects a couple of things, right?

archived recording (anderson cooper) Senator Sanders, your response? archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me make a point. I think —

alexander burns

The moderators sort of teed up Bernie Sanders, if he wanted to go after Biden on the Hunter Ukraine issue.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured.

alexander burns

Bernie just totally did not take the bait, and neither did anybody else. And part of that is I think a sense among other Democrats that going at the Hunter issue, you really, really risk sort of triggering sympathy for Biden and looking like you are taking Trump’s side in a fight. And I think maybe as big or a bigger part of it is this calculation by a lot of the candidates on stage who want Joe Biden’s supporters to move over to their camp. That the way to do that is not by attacking Joe Biden and that you kind of got to trust that Biden is going to continue sinking in this race just by the force of gravity and his own limitations as a candidate and present yourself as a compelling alternative for people who are looking for a more moderate or a more conventional set of qualifications. And they do that by going after Elizabeth Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — after that. archived recording (marc lacey) Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for “Medicare for all.” You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?

maggie haberman

And you saw that right away with a question about Medicare for all, which she has been facing repeated questions about and people trying to pin her down.

michael barbaro

Right. There’s first an effort by our colleague, Marc Lacey, to twice pin her down on whether or not her Medicare for all plan would require a tax increase for middle-class voters. She doesn’t really answer the yes or no question.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not —

michael barbaro

Then Pete Buttigieg tries to get her to answer it and on and on. And she’s just kind of resolutely unwilling to say yes or no.

alexander burns

And it’s not even really sort of an ideological attack on her, right? You saw Pete Buttigieg pushing her just to sort of be straight on this question.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out —

alexander burns

It’s almost sort of a character attack as much as anything else. She loves talking about the mechanics of policy and where revenue will come from and where it will go and how regulations work and how it will change the way companies are structured. And the fact that this is the one place where she won’t say what we heard Bernie Sanders say —

archived recording (bernie sanders) Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up.

alexander burns

It would be a super sort of Warren-y answer, except she just doesn’t want to give it.

michael barbaro

And why exactly won’t she answer it, Maggie?

Well, she won’t answer it because there’s not a great answer to the question. Usually when there is not a great answer to the question, you’ll see a politician do what she is doing, which is evade steadfastly.

archived recording (marc lacey) Senator — Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up? archived recording (elizabeth warren) So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind —

maggie haberman

The answer is most likely to be that there will be a tax hike, and that’s not an answer that she wants to be holding herself to right now. I also think that she’s probably leaving herself a little bit of room — emphasis on a little — for a general election on how she might answer this question of a pay-for for this plan. Her opponent, potentially, Donald Trump, is thrilled seeing her talk about this, because Trump and his advisers believe this is going to be an area where they can really push her and try to shove her closer toward the socialist label that he’s been trying to affix to most Democrats.

michael barbaro

And Alex, what did you think was the most notable exchange inside of this first round of efforts by the moderate Democrats on this stage to come after Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

Look, I thought it was the combination of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both speaking about Warren in terms of honesty.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is —

alexander burns

You heard Klobuchar, who has been so careful so far in this race to be very collegial with her Senate colleagues.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that. And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.

alexander burns

You heard her essentially describe Warren’s plans as a pipe dream.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done, and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers —

alexander burns

This is really harsh stuff, right? This is the kind of criticism that you have heard at other points in the race directed at Joe Biden.

maggie haberman

One thing, too, that I was struck by in Klobuchar’s answer is she more than once said that essentially, to Warren, your way of doing things is not the only way.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t —

michael barbaro

And does that reflect some kind of larger sentiment among these moderate candidates about Warren and about the way that she campaigns?

alexander burns

I think it reflects a resentment among some of the more moderate candidates of the way Warren argues sometimes explicitly, sometimes a little bit more subtly, that if you don’t approach policy the same way she does, it’s because you don’t have political guts. You don’t have grit. You’re not willing to fight —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we’ve — archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — got to stop —

alexander burns

For somebody like Amy Klobuchar, she sees how you get stuff done in government differently. She doesn’t think it makes her a coward. She thinks it sort of just reflects a different set of political values.

michael barbaro

So what’s the next notable exchange?

archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Congressman. archived recording (erin burnett) Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate.

alexander burns

You have this even messier multi-candidate pile-on around Warren’s proposal for a tax on huge private fortunes.

archived recording (erin burnett) Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.

alexander burns

That it sort of begins with this exchange involving Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, the only billionaire on stage, where —

archived recording (erin burnett) What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

alexander burns

— I think there’s an attempt by the moderators to try to draw out Steyer in a way that would maybe stir some tension on stage. And he basically says, look —

archived recording (tom steyer) Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor.

alexander burns

— wealth concentration is a problem. Then the spotlight moves back to some of those moderates we talked about before.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) This is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — to who sounded better on a debate stage — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. archived recording (pete buttigieg) — debate stage or in a committee hearing — archived recording (erin burnett) Senator Klobuchar — Senator Klobuchar — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — versus what it’s actually going to take to get something done. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I want to give a reality che — archived recording (erin burnett) Will a wealth tax work? archived recording (amy klobuchar) It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

alexander burns

You hear Amy Klobuchar not attacking the idea of a wealth tax — she says that she’s open to the idea — but again criticizing Warren for this sense that Warren thinks her ideas are the only good ideas.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that, after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.

alexander burns

Nobody is actually challenging the substance of her policy idea here. And in fact, you hear people across the ideological spectrum in the party either endorsing a wealth tax or at least indicating their openness to a wealth tax.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

alexander burns

So to me, this part is more of a primal scream of frustration towards Elizabeth Warren than a really concerted policy challenge.

michael barbaro

And when you say primal scream of frustration, I’m guessing you don’t just mean the fact that they think she talks about her ideas as if they are the best and the only good ideas, but perhaps because she’s just doing really well?

alexander burns

She is doing really well, right? That if you look back to where this race was when Beto O’Rourke got into it, right, back in the late winter or early spring, he was one of the leading candidates. Elizabeth Warren was at the back of the polls and struggling to sort of find two dimes to rub together for her campaign, right? Now she is one of the biggest fundraisers in the field. He is at the back of the pack, struggling to survive. And you do see — you saw it earlier in the race with Joe Biden. You see it now with Elizabeth Warren. People who are polling towards the back of the pack, trying to have some kind of impact in this race, go after the front-runner.

archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Senator Booker. archived recording (anderson cooper) We’ve got to take a quick break. We’ve got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio. We’ll be right back after this. [APPLAUSE]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording (anderson cooper) And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered —

michael barbaro

So as this debate went on, it felt like we saw the first substantive conversation on foreign policy that I can remember from these Democratic debates, in part, I think, because of the urgency of the situation that’s playing out in Syria. I wonder if it felt that way to both of you.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Vice President Biden, we —

maggie haberman

It didn’t feel that substantive to me, candidly. It felt urgent, and it felt emotional.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership.

maggie haberman

What I think was striking about it is that Joe Biden, who was vice president, seemed to really struggle in his answer to this question about what he would do and what he thought was necessary.

archived recording (joe biden) What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where — he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real locked-down conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now. Pay that price.

maggie haberman

I think that Biden still sounded as if he wasn’t quite sure what to do. And I really thought going into this debate that this was going to be an issue that Biden was going to score lots of points on, because it’s right in his wheelhouse.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s one of the ways that Biden has tried to distinguish himself, by pointing to his experience and his gravitas, especially around matters like foreign policy and military conflict.

archived recording (joe biden) I think I may be — doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan.

alexander burns

Right. You heard him make that argument quite explicitly, that he’s the one person on stage who needs no on-the-job training, that he has dealt with Putin, he has dealt with Erdogan directly. What he struggles with, as Maggie was saying, is communicating that in a way that conveys a sense of command and reassurance to the people who are watching the debate. I did think there were at least the germs of a bigger ideological argument about foreign policy.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this —

alexander burns

You did hear a pretty stark difference between Biden, on the one hand, who, not in a terribly articulate way, talked about keeping American troops in Syria in some fashion, and Elizabeth Warren saying quite directly that she wants to get rid of those troops, just not in the way Donald Trump has gone about doing it.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to get — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no — archived recording (anderson cooper) Yeah. Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — military solution — archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor Buttigieg? archived recording (elizabeth warren) — in this region.

michael barbaro

And Alex, does that ideological breakdown, when it comes to how the United States should use military forces, does that fall along familiar domestic debate ideological fault lines? Or is it different?

alexander burns

It doesn’t map precisely onto the same fault lines as domestic policy, economic policy, health care. But I do think that the more populist wing of the party represented by Warren and Sanders and a couple other people intermittently onstage is much more skeptical of the idea of the United States being involved in foreign wars, of having permanent troop presence overseas. And it is something, Michael, as you obviously recall, that the president played to quite effectively in 2016, is this idea that there actua — there may be a consensus in Washington for the United States to play this kind of role in foreign countries, but in the rest of America, there’s a lot of exhaustion and a lot of skepticism. And that’s part of what I think was so challenging for Biden in this moment, right? That just talking about restoring the bipartisan foreign policy consensus isn’t necessarily super compelling to base primary voters, at least the ones who are voting on foreign policy.

archived recording (anderson cooper) As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.

michael barbaro

So toward the end of the debate, the moderators asked this question that sort of seems to be pointed directly at this central tension that’s been playing out on stage.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump? archived recording (joe biden) Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people.

michael barbaro

I wonder what you make of the answers to that question.

alexander burns

Well, first, I think it’s really striking that the question needed to be asked in this specific way in order to draw Biden into conflict with Warren and Sanders. In past debates, he’s been so eager to go after them on a whole range of policies. In this debate, there were big sections of the night where he seemed to really fade from the foreground of this thing. And the moderators really sort of summon him to rise to this moment as a champion of the center in this race.

archived recording (joe biden) I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done.

alexander burns

He does it by describing himself as the only person on the stage who’s ever gotten big things done. He talks about the Violence Against Women Act. He talks about the Affordable Care Act. And he runs pretty quickly into quite a challenging confrontation with both Bernie Sanders and Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington —

maggie haberman

What ended up happening was Warren starts talking about her accomplishments. She talks about what she did after the 2008 fiscal crisis. She talks about her time at the C.F.P.B. She talks about what she wants to do.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) If we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — for the things that touch people’s lives. archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor — archived recording (joe biden) I agree —

maggie haberman

But you had Biden try to come back at Warren as she’s talking about what she did. He says, “I got you votes.”

archived recording (joe biden) I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight too.

maggie haberman

She sort of lets him finish. And there’s a pause, and you can see her almost drawing breath.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. And I am deeply —

maggie haberman

It’s a real dagger, because it’s a reminder that so much of what Joe Biden has done in this race has been talking about Obama’s record. Biden doesn’t handle that well —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) But understand — archived recording (joe biden) You did a hell of a job at your job. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Thank you. But understand this —

maggie haberman

— gets unhappy about it and pushes back that you did well in the role that you were in, meaning at the C.F.P.B. And there was just silence in the debate hall when he did it. It underscored what I think has been a theme for Biden in this race and certainly throughout the night when he was present onstage, which is it had this aura of don’t you understand that this is my turn, this is what I’m due? And it reminded me so much of what we would see with Hillary Clinton in 2016.

alexander burns

I think it was also just a total mismanagement by Biden of the dynamics of interacting with an emerging female front-runner in this race. That there was really no need, if you look at the record that he is standing on, for him to then try to sort of take a piece of her signature achievement, the creation of this new regulatory agency. And I think it was a reflection of her sort of lack of interest in escalating a fight with him, her sort of view that it didn’t make sense for her to sort of get into an extended fight with Joe Biden, that she didn’t come back at him harder on that front. It was a real role reversal from what we’ve seen in the race previously, where Joe Biden sort of goes from being the hunted to being the hunter as he sort of loses some traction at the top of this race.

archived recording (joe biden) And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who’s going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how are you going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade. archived recording (anderson cooper) Just to clarify —

michael barbaro

Alex, given the sensitive moment that Joe Biden is in right now with the president’s attacks on him and his son, is there an argument to be made that the best thing that could happen to Biden during this debate was kind of exactly what did happen? That he got to kind of hide away a little bit while all the moderates went after somebody else, Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

I think you can make the case that the best-case scenario for Biden at this point is to sort of protect the base that he has right now, hold steady, and trust the rest of the field to stay fractured. And if that’s the best case for him, then maybe that’s what he did tonight. I think it’s a really, really risky strategy, because it counts on everybody else being ineffective at appealing to the voters who are currently supporting you. So I think you could look at this as a low-risk debate for Biden, where he probably didn’t do damage to himself actively. I think you could also see it as a real missed opportunity for a guy who does have unmatched foreign policy credentials on that stage, who has been victimized by the president in a way that has launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump —

michael barbaro

Right.

alexander burns

— and who didn’t sort of wrap all that together and create a bigger moment for his campaign.

maggie haberman

I totally agree.

michael barbaro

Maggie, Alex, thank you. Good night, slash, good morning. We’ll talk soon.

We’ll be right back.

michael barbaro Are you on deadline? michael schmidt No. michael barbaro Well, I’m looking for someone to tell me what else I need to know today. michael schmidt Um —

michael schmidt

On Tuesday, George Kent, a senior State Department adviser on Ukraine, went up to Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment proceedings. In Kent’s testimony, he says that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told him not to worry about Ukraine policy. Obviously, a little weird for a State Department official who specializes in Ukraine policy.

michael barbaro

The message being, like, we’ve got Ukraine over here at the White House. You at the State Department, that’s not your issue anymore.

michael schmidt

Yet another odd way that the administration was handling its policy towards Ukraine. In the middle of this testimony, Giuliani himself puts out a letter that says that he is not going to comply with a subpoena from the House. The impeachment investigators want to talk to him. Giuliani says, nope, not coming. This is a sham, and he’s not going to participate.

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording (amy robach) If your last name wasn’t Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma? archived recording (hunter biden) I don’t know. I don’t know. Probably not. I don’t think that there’s a lot of things that would have happened in my life that — if my last name wasn’t Biden.

michael schmidt

The other thing you need to know is that Joe Biden’s son Hunter gave an interview with ABC News this morning in which he took on the attacks that Trump has leveled at him about Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And Giuliani.

michael schmidt

Correct, and Giuliani. And he basically said, was it the best thing that I sat on the board of this energy company in Ukraine? Probably not. But he says that these allegations that Giuliani and Trump have thrown at him and thrown at his father about how his dad intervened to help the energy company, it’s all nonsense. There’s nothing to it.

archived recording (hunter biden) You know what? I’m a human. And you know what? Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based upon some un — ethical lapse? Absolutely not.

maggie haberman

Good morning.

michael barbaro

So believe it or not, with you being in Ohio, me in Washington, and this team of editors and producers in New York, this is not exactly a flawless technical operation at 12:35 a.m.

alexander burns

I have faith in your crack team.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] I have faith too. It’s really the technology I’m beginning to question.

alexander burns

Hmm.

michael barbaro

Hmm. O.K., let’s do this. Alex, if you were going to summarize tonight in a sentence, what would it be?

alexander burns

I think this was the night where you really saw the moderate candidates on stage find their thirst for combat. And I think, interestingly, you saw that displayed not by folks like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar going after Joe Biden, the leading moderate candidate at this point in the race, but you saw it happen by them going after Elizabeth Warren to try to sort of prove their centrist credentials by challenging the left.

michael barbaro

Right. The front-runner who’s not actually quite the front-runner. I checked the polls right before the debate and by all accounts, statistically speaking, that is Joe Biden.

alexander burns

In an average of national polls, Joe Biden has a slight lead over Elizabeth Warren still in this race. But every other candidate in the race can read those trend lines just like we can. She is moving steadily up. He is moving steadily down. And the picture is even more pronounced in the early voting states, like Iowa and New Hampshire. So if you are a Pete Buttigieg or an Amy Klobuchar and you have staked your candidacy on a breakthrough in the Midwest, it is a bigger issue for you to get past Joe Biden and present yourself as a clear, compelling alternative to Elizabeth Warren than it is to go at Joe Biden directly.

michael barbaro

O.K., so let’s talk about how that actually played out.

archived recording (anderson cooper) This is the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate.

maggie haberman

So all 12 candidates are on stage. The debate begins.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support.

maggie haberman

The first question inevitably is about impeachment. This is the first debate since the impeachment inquiry began.

archived recording (anderson cooper) But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.

maggie haberman

And you had all 12 candidates in agreement —

archived recording (bernie sanders) I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment.

maggie haberman

— that they believe that Donald Trump should be impeached.

archived recording (joe biden) They would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.

maggie haberman

This is a big change from where things were within this Democratic field even a month ago.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment.

maggie haberman

And everybody was in unison. They didn’t all necessarily agree that he should be removed from office, but they did agree that he should be impeached.

archived recording (kamala harris) Our framers imagined this moment — a moment where we would have a corrupt president.

michael barbaro

Right. It seemed like every candidate used some version of the phrase “Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country.” It was almost verbatim.

archived recording (joe biden) This president is the most corrupt president in modern history — archived recording (bernie sanders) In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president — archived recording (tom steyer) — most corrupt president in the country. And that only the voice —

maggie haberman

And look, these candidates have generally tried to avoid having these debates be specifically just about Donald Trump. This was among the most Donald Trump-heavy first 10 minutes of a debate that I can recall.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the —

But instead of using that moment as a way for any of them to sort of use a back door to criticize Joe Biden over the issue related to his son and the work his son had done in Ukraine while Biden was vice president, they all very pointedly, clearly, did not want to join President Trump’s attacks on Joe Biden.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

maggie haberman

None of them brought it up on their own as the debate went on. The rest of the night was really absent any issue related to Biden except for a question from the moderators.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. If it’s not O.K. for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it O.K. for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden? archived recording (joe biden) Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government.

michael barbaro

And everyone seemed quite ready to avoid it and just move on.

alexander burns

Right. And I think that that reflects a couple of things, right?

archived recording (anderson cooper) Senator Sanders, your response? archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me make a point. I think —

alexander burns

The moderators sort of teed up Bernie Sanders, if he wanted to go after Biden on the Hunter Ukraine issue.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured.

alexander burns

Bernie just totally did not take the bait, and neither did anybody else. And part of that is I think a sense among other Democrats that going at the Hunter issue, you really, really risk sort of triggering sympathy for Biden and looking like you are taking Trump’s side in a fight. And I think maybe as big or a bigger part of it is this calculation by a lot of the candidates on stage who want Joe Biden’s supporters to move over to their camp. That the way to do that is not by attacking Joe Biden and that you kind of got to trust that Biden is going to continue sinking in this race just by the force of gravity and his own limitations as a candidate and present yourself as a compelling alternative for people who are looking for a more moderate or a more conventional set of qualifications. And they do that by going after Elizabeth Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — after that. archived recording (marc lacey) Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for “Medicare for all.” You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?

maggie haberman

And you saw that right away with a question about Medicare for all, which she has been facing repeated questions about and people trying to pin her down.

michael barbaro

Right. There’s first an effort by our colleague, Marc Lacey, to twice pin her down on whether or not her Medicare for all plan would require a tax increase for middle-class voters. She doesn’t really answer the yes or no question.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not —

michael barbaro

Then Pete Buttigieg tries to get her to answer it and on and on. And she’s just kind of resolutely unwilling to say yes or no.

alexander burns

And it’s not even really sort of an ideological attack on her, right? You saw Pete Buttigieg pushing her just to sort of be straight on this question.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out —

alexander burns

It’s almost sort of a character attack as much as anything else. She loves talking about the mechanics of policy and where revenue will come from and where it will go and how regulations work and how it will change the way companies are structured. And the fact that this is the one place where she won’t say what we heard Bernie Sanders say —

archived recording (bernie sanders) Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up.

alexander burns

It would be a super sort of Warren-y answer, except she just doesn’t want to give it.

michael barbaro

And why exactly won’t she answer it, Maggie?

maggie haberman

Well, she won’t answer it because there’s not a great answer to the question. Usually when there is not a great answer to the question, you’ll see a politician do what she is doing, which is evade steadfastly.

archived recording (marc lacey) Senator — Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up? archived recording (elizabeth warren) So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind —

maggie haberman

The answer is most likely to be that there will be a tax hike, and that’s not an answer that she wants to be holding herself to right now. I also think that she’s probably leaving herself a little bit of room — emphasis on a little — for a general election on how she might answer this question of a pay-for for this plan. Her opponent, potentially, Donald Trump, is thrilled seeing her talk about this, because Trump and his advisers believe this is going to be an area where they can really push her and try to shove her closer toward the socialist label that he’s been trying to affix to most Democrats.

michael barbaro

And Alex, what did you think was the most notable exchange inside of this first round of efforts by the moderate Democrats on this stage to come after Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

Look, I thought it was the combination of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both speaking about Warren in terms of honesty.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is —

alexander burns

You heard Klobuchar, who has been so careful so far in this race to be very collegial with her Senate colleagues.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that. And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.

alexander burns

You heard her essentially describe Warren’s plans as a pipe dream.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done, and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers —

alexander burns

This is really harsh stuff, right? This is the kind of criticism that you have heard at other points in the race directed at Joe Biden.

maggie haberman

One thing, too, that I was struck by in Klobuchar’s answer is she more than once said that essentially, to Warren, your way of doing things is not the only way.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t —

michael barbaro

And does that reflect some kind of larger sentiment among these moderate candidates about Warren and about the way that she campaigns?

alexander burns

I think it reflects a resentment among some of the more moderate candidates of the way Warren argues sometimes explicitly, sometimes a little bit more subtly, that if you don’t approach policy the same way she does, it’s because you don’t have political guts. You don’t have grit. You’re not willing to fight —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we’ve — archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — got to stop —

alexander burns

For somebody like Amy Klobuchar, she sees how you get stuff done in government differently. She doesn’t think it makes her a coward. She thinks it sort of just reflects a different set of political values.

michael barbaro

So what’s the next notable exchange?

archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Congressman. archived recording (erin burnett) Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate.

alexander burns

You have this even messier multi-candidate pile-on around Warren’s proposal for a tax on huge private fortunes.

archived recording (erin burnett) Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.

alexander burns

That it sort of begins with this exchange involving Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, the only billionaire on stage, where —

archived recording (erin burnett) What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

alexander burns

— I think there’s an attempt by the moderators to try to draw out Steyer in a way that would maybe stir some tension on stage. And he basically says, look —

archived recording (tom steyer) Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor.

alexander burns

— wealth concentration is a problem. Then the spotlight moves back to some of those moderates we talked about before.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) This is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — to who sounded better on a debate stage — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. archived recording (pete buttigieg) — debate stage or in a committee hearing — archived recording (erin burnett) Senator Klobuchar — Senator Klobuchar — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — versus what it’s actually going to take to get something done. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I want to give a reality che — archived recording (erin burnett) Will a wealth tax work? archived recording (amy klobuchar) It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

alexander burns

You hear Amy Klobuchar not attacking the idea of a wealth tax — she says that she’s open to the idea — but again criticizing Warren for this sense that Warren thinks her ideas are the only good ideas.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that, after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.

alexander burns

Nobody is actually challenging the substance of her policy idea here. And in fact, you hear people across the ideological spectrum in the party either endorsing a wealth tax or at least indicating their openness to a wealth tax.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

alexander burns

So to me, this part is more of a primal scream of frustration towards Elizabeth Warren than a really concerted policy challenge.

michael barbaro

And when you say primal scream of frustration, I’m guessing you don’t just mean the fact that they think she talks about her ideas as if they are the best and the only good ideas, but perhaps because she’s just doing really well?

alexander burns

She is doing really well, right? That if you look back to where this race was when Beto O’Rourke got into it, right, back in the late winter or early spring, he was one of the leading candidates. Elizabeth Warren was at the back of the polls and struggling to sort of find two dimes to rub together for her campaign, right? Now she is one of the biggest fundraisers in the field. He is at the back of the pack, struggling to survive. And you do see — you saw it earlier in the race with Joe Biden. You see it now with Elizabeth Warren. People who are polling towards the back of the pack, trying to have some kind of impact in this race, go after the front-runner.

archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Senator Booker. archived recording (anderson cooper) We’ve got to take a quick break. We’ve got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio. We’ll be right back after this. [APPLAUSE]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording (anderson cooper) And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered —

michael barbaro

So as this debate went on, it felt like we saw the first substantive conversation on foreign policy that I can remember from these Democratic debates, in part, I think, because of the urgency of the situation that’s playing out in Syria. I wonder if it felt that way to both of you.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Vice President Biden, we —

maggie haberman

It didn’t feel that substantive to me, candidly. It felt urgent, and it felt emotional.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership.

maggie haberman

What I think was striking about it is that Joe Biden, who was vice president, seemed to really struggle in his answer to this question about what he would do and what he thought was necessary.

archived recording (joe biden) What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where — he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real locked-down conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now. Pay that price.

maggie haberman

I think that Biden still sounded as if he wasn’t quite sure what to do. And I really thought going into this debate that this was going to be an issue that Biden was going to score lots of points on, because it’s right in his wheelhouse.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s one of the ways that Biden has tried to distinguish himself, by pointing to his experience and his gravitas, especially around matters like foreign policy and military conflict.

archived recording (joe biden) I think I may be — doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan.

alexander burns

Right. You heard him make that argument quite explicitly, that he’s the one person on stage who needs no on-the-job training, that he has dealt with Putin, he has dealt with Erdogan directly. What he struggles with, as Maggie was saying, is communicating that in a way that conveys a sense of command and reassurance to the people who are watching the debate. I did think there were at least the germs of a bigger ideological argument about foreign policy.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this —

alexander burns

You did hear a pretty stark difference between Biden, on the one hand, who, not in a terribly articulate way, talked about keeping American troops in Syria in some fashion, and Elizabeth Warren saying quite directly that she wants to get rid of those troops, just not in the way Donald Trump has gone about doing it.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to get — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no — archived recording (anderson cooper) Yeah. Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — military solution — archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor Buttigieg? archived recording (elizabeth warren) — in this region.

michael barbaro

And Alex, does that ideological breakdown, when it comes to how the United States should use military forces, does that fall along familiar domestic debate ideological fault lines? Or is it different?

alexander burns

It doesn’t map precisely onto the same fault lines as domestic policy, economic policy, health care. But I do think that the more populist wing of the party represented by Warren and Sanders and a couple other people intermittently onstage is much more skeptical of the idea of the United States being involved in foreign wars, of having permanent troop presence overseas. And it is something, Michael, as you obviously recall, that the president played to quite effectively in 2016, is this idea that there actua — there may be a consensus in Washington for the United States to play this kind of role in foreign countries, but in the rest of America, there’s a lot of exhaustion and a lot of skepticism. And that’s part of what I think was so challenging for Biden in this moment, right? That just talking about restoring the bipartisan foreign policy consensus isn’t necessarily super compelling to base primary voters, at least the ones who are voting on foreign policy.

archived recording (anderson cooper) As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.

michael barbaro

So toward the end of the debate, the moderators asked this question that sort of seems to be pointed directly at this central tension that’s been playing out on stage.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump? archived recording (joe biden) Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people.

michael barbaro

I wonder what you make of the answers to that question.

alexander burns

Well, first, I think it’s really striking that the question needed to be asked in this specific way in order to draw Biden into conflict with Warren and Sanders. In past debates, he’s been so eager to go after them on a whole range of policies. In this debate, there were big sections of the night where he seemed to really fade from the foreground of this thing. And the moderators really sort of summon him to rise to this moment as a champion of the center in this race.

archived recording (joe biden) I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done.

alexander burns

He does it by describing himself as the only person on the stage who’s ever gotten big things done. He talks about the Violence Against Women Act. He talks about the Affordable Care Act. And he runs pretty quickly into quite a challenging confrontation with both Bernie Sanders and Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington —

maggie haberman

What ended up happening was Warren starts talking about her accomplishments. She talks about what she did after the 2008 fiscal crisis. She talks about her time at the C.F.P.B. She talks about what she wants to do.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) If we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — for the things that touch people’s lives. archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor — archived recording (joe biden) I agree —

maggie haberman

But you had Biden try to come back at Warren as she’s talking about what she did. He says, “I got you votes.”

archived recording (joe biden) I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight too.

maggie haberman

She sort of lets him finish. And there’s a pause, and you can see her almost drawing breath.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. And I am deeply —

maggie haberman

It’s a real dagger, because it’s a reminder that so much of what Joe Biden has done in this race has been talking about Obama’s record. Biden doesn’t handle that well —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) But understand — archived recording (joe biden) You did a hell of a job at your job. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Thank you. But understand this —

maggie haberman

— gets unhappy about it and pushes back that you did well in the role that you were in, meaning at the C.F.P.B. And there was just silence in the debate hall when he did it. It underscored what I think has been a theme for Biden in this race and certainly throughout the night when he was present onstage, which is it had this aura of don’t you understand that this is my turn, this is what I’m due? And it reminded me so much of what we would see with Hillary Clinton in 2016.

alexander burns

I think it was also just a total mismanagement by Biden of the dynamics of interacting with an emerging female front-runner in this race. That there was really no need, if you look at the record that he is standing on, for him to then try to sort of take a piece of her signature achievement, the creation of this new regulatory agency. And I think it was a reflection of her sort of lack of interest in escalating a fight with him, her sort of view that it didn’t make sense for her to sort of get into an extended fight with Joe Biden, that she didn’t come back at him harder on that front. It was a real role reversal from what we’ve seen in the race previously, where Joe Biden sort of goes from being the hunted to being the hunter as he sort of loses some traction at the top of this race.

archived recording (joe biden) And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who’s going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how are you going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade. archived recording (anderson cooper) Just to clarify —

michael barbaro

Alex, given the sensitive moment that Joe Biden is in right now with the president’s attacks on him and his son, is there an argument to be made that the best thing that could happen to Biden during this debate was kind of exactly what did happen? That he got to kind of hide away a little bit while all the moderates went after somebody else, Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

I think you can make the case that the best-case scenario for Biden at this point is to sort of protect the base that he has right now, hold steady, and trust the rest of the field to stay fractured. And if that’s the best case for him, then maybe that’s what he did tonight. I think it’s a really, really risky strategy, because it counts on everybody else being ineffective at appealing to the voters who are currently supporting you. So I think you could look at this as a low-risk debate for Biden, where he probably didn’t do damage to himself actively. I think you could also see it as a real missed opportunity for a guy who does have unmatched foreign policy credentials on that stage, who has been victimized by the president in a way that has launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump —

michael barbaro

Right.

alexander burns

— and who didn’t sort of wrap all that together and create a bigger moment for his campaign.

maggie haberman

I totally agree.

michael barbaro

Maggie, Alex, thank you. Good night, slash, good morning. We’ll talk soon.

michael barbaro Are you on deadline? michael schmidt No. michael barbaro Well, I’m looking for someone to tell me what else I need to know today. michael schmidt Um —

michael schmidt

On Tuesday, George Kent, a senior State Department adviser on Ukraine, went up to Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment proceedings. In Kent’s testimony, he says that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told him not to worry about Ukraine policy. Obviously, a little weird for a State Department official who specializes in Ukraine policy.

michael barbaro

The message being, like, we’ve got Ukraine over here at the White House. You at the State Department, that’s not your issue anymore.

michael schmidt

Yet another odd way that the administration was handling its policy towards Ukraine. In the middle of this testimony, Giuliani himself puts out a letter that says that he is not going to comply with a subpoena from the House. The impeachment investigators want to talk to him. Giuliani says, nope, not coming. This is a sham, and he’s not going to participate.

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording (amy robach) If your last name wasn’t Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma? archived recording (hunter biden) I don’t know. I don’t know. Probably not. I don’t think that there’s a lot of things that would have happened in my life that — if my last name wasn’t Biden.

michael schmidt

The other thing you need to know is that Joe Biden’s son Hunter gave an interview with ABC News this morning in which he took on the attacks that Trump has leveled at him about Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And Giuliani.

michael schmidt

Correct, and Giuliani. And he basically said, was it the best thing that I sat on the board of this energy company in Ukraine? Probably not. But he says that these allegations that Giuliani and Trump have thrown at him and thrown at his father about how his dad intervened to help the energy company, it’s all nonsense. There’s nothing to it.

archived recording (hunter biden) You know what? I’m a human. And you know what? Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based upon some un — ethical lapse? Absolutely not.

Some candidates have more maneuvering room than others to challenge the two leaders: Whereas Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders are flush with cash, Ms. Klobuchar is in a far more tenuous financial position and has yet to qualify for the debate in November. At least a few other candidates who took an assertive approach Tuesday are in similar straits, straining to raise money or meet the debate threshold or both.

What could prove decisive in Iowa, and beyond, is if centrist voters coalesce behind a single candidate or fracture among the group of hopefuls presenting themselves as pragmatists. If Mr. Biden cannot recover a measure of momentum, but holds on to enough support to block other candidates from building a coalition of more moderate Democrats, it could allow Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders to roll through the earliest primaries and caucuses with relatively weak opposition.

This scenario, of a sort of zombie Biden candidacy, is what most alarms supporters of other center-left Democrats in the race.

Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, a close ally of Mr. Buttigieg, predicted the South Bend mayor would now “dig down deep in Iowa and New Hampshire,” carrying his message from the debate — a combination of uplifting rhetoric about the future and blunt criticism of certain progressive policies — into the early states where he’s polling in fourth place.

But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists and consultants from both parties.

Here is a sampling of their reactions.

Warren took fire from all sides

The strategists agreed on one thing: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s new front-runner status was clear, because she was everyone else’s biggest target. But they were divided on how well she handled the attacks.

“Warren took almost everyone’s best punch there & came away basically unscathed.” — Jesse Lehrich, former foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton “Heading into this debate as a frontrunner, she did not seem ready for the incoming.” — Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and former Democratic National Committee spokesman “This is the @ewarren debate. You might be happy or sad about it, but she’s the one who is setting the tone and she’s the reference point for most of the other candidates. That happens to the frontrunner.” — Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics

Buttigieg stood out …

Several consultants said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., had successfully set himself up as an alternative for moderate Democrats uneasy with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They particularly liked his responses on foreign policy, which he framed in terms of his own experience in the military.

“Very strong, passionate and compelling condemnation of @realDonaldTrump betrayal of Kurds from Northern Syria by @PeteButtigieg. Owning this discussion.” — David Axelrod, former chief strategist for Barack Obama “I am impressed with Buttigieg on foreign policy. Like Biden, he really shines and opens up when he talks about FP.” — Jess Morales Rocketto, political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance “This has been @PeteButtigieg’s best #DemDebate performance so far. While other candidates tried to out-left and anti-Trump each other, Mayor Pete came across as reasonable and rational.” — Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster

… and so did Klobuchar

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota received similarly positive reviews, with strategists arguing that she and Mr. Buttigieg in the middle against Ms. Warren on the left was the biggest dynamic of the night.

“@amyklobuchar performance tonight will resonate with moderate Democrats who are tired of being told that they are sellouts if they don’t subscribe to most left views. It’s a theme that’s cut across all her answers tonight & why she is having a good night.” — Jennifer Palmieri, former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama “With 11 other people on stage, you don’t get a lot of opportunities to make an impression. But she’s finding them, using each one to stand out and draw a contrast.” — Mo Elleithee “Every time Amy Klobuchar speaks she says something sensible. Not sure that makes her electable, but it’s nice to hear.” — Joe Lockhart, former spokesman for President Bill Clinton

Sanders was reassuring

After his heart attack two weeks ago, Senator Bernie Sanders badly needed to project strength and stamina, and on the whole, the consensus was that he succeeded.

“What heart attack?! @BernieSanders is giving a strong performance and not missing a step.” — Patti Solis Doyle, senior adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign “Bernie Sanders making a damn important point here — stuff in our county was bad before Trump was elected, and this election has to be about more than defeating Trump.” — Sally Kohn, progressive commentator and former campaign strategist “This was @BernieSanders’ best debate by far, but I still don’t hear him making a pitch to people who don’t already support him.” — Laura Belin, Iowa political commentator

Biden had an uneven performance

Mr. Biden won praise for his responses on foreign policy — frequently a strong area for him — but was criticized for seeming to claim credit for Ms. Warren’s work establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

“Biden needs to have a clear and compelling response to the Trump charge against him and his son, and I assumed he would have prepared one, but his answer is not sharp. When asked ‘did you make a mistake?’ he snaps back with a much sharper line.” — Robert Reich, professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and former labor secretary No one more experienced on foreign policy on this debate stage than @JoeBiden. This is where his experience shines and reminds voters that experience does matter.” — Adrienne Elrod, former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton “Biden yelling ‘I GOT you votes’ at Warren is not the best look.” — Kelly Dittmar, scholar at Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics

Other standout moments

Several other candidates got good reviews for specific answers: Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker on reproductive rights, and the former housing secretary Julián Castro for the statement, “Police violence is also gun violence.”

“Such a smart move by @KamalaHarris to refocus the conversation on women’s reproductive rights. She listened to women since the last debate and will gain attention and praise for it.” — Kelly Dittmar “@CoryBooker brings a lot to this primary, but perhaps his greatest debate contribution is his continuance to be the moral compass, reminding candidates and the audience what this campaign is really all about: defeating Trump and helping people live better lives.” — Adrienne Elrod “Castro was really strong on police violence there and brought in an angle on seizing guns that other candidates missed.” — Seth Masket, political scientist at the University of Denver

We need someone to take office this time around who on Day 1 can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders from Putin to our allies, and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track. It is required, now more than any time in any of our lifetimes, to have someone who has that capacity on Day 1. That’s one of the reasons why I decided to run, why I decided to run this time, because I know what has to be done. I’ve done it before. I’ve been there when we pulled the nation out of the worst financial recession in history.

I know what has to be done. I will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office.

Forty percent of Democratic primary voters say they think a candidate under the age of 70 is more likely to defeat President Trump. What do you say to them?

WARREN: Well, I say I will outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with. Look, the way I see this, the way we’re going to win is by addressing head-on what millions of Americans know in their bones, and that is that the wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy, and they’re making it work for themselves and leaving everyone else behind. And political pundits and Washington insiders and, shoot, people in our own party don’t want to admit that. They think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy. They are wrong. If all Democrats can promise is after Donald Trump, it will be business as usual, then we will lose. Democrats win when we call out what’s broken and we show how to fix it.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] I have faith too. It’s really the technology I’m beginning to question.

alexander burns

Hmm.

michael barbaro

Hmm. O.K., let’s do this. Alex, if you were going to summarize tonight in a sentence, what would it be?

alexander burns

I think this was the night where you really saw the moderate candidates on stage find their thirst for combat. And I think, interestingly, you saw that displayed not by folks like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar going after Joe Biden, the leading moderate candidate at this point in the race, but you saw it happen by them going after Elizabeth Warren to try to sort of prove their centrist credentials by challenging the left.

michael barbaro

Right. The front-runner who’s not actually quite the front-runner. I checked the polls right before the debate and by all accounts, statistically speaking, that is Joe Biden.

alexander burns

In an average of national polls, Joe Biden has a slight lead over Elizabeth Warren still in this race. But every other candidate in the race can read those trend lines just like we can. She is moving steadily up. He is moving steadily down. And the picture is even more pronounced in the early voting states, like Iowa and New Hampshire. So if you are a Pete Buttigieg or an Amy Klobuchar and you have staked your candidacy on a breakthrough in the Midwest, it is a bigger issue for you to get past Joe Biden and present yourself as a clear, compelling alternative to Elizabeth Warren than it is to go at Joe Biden directly.

michael barbaro

O.K., so let’s talk about how that actually played out.

archived recording (anderson cooper) This is the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate.

maggie haberman

So all 12 candidates are on stage. The debate begins.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support.

maggie haberman

The first question inevitably is about impeachment. This is the first debate since the impeachment inquiry began.

archived recording (anderson cooper) But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.

maggie haberman

And you had all 12 candidates in agreement —

archived recording (bernie sanders) I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment.

maggie haberman

— that they believe that Donald Trump should be impeached.

archived recording (joe biden) They would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.

maggie haberman

This is a big change from where things were within this Democratic field even a month ago.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment.

maggie haberman

And everybody was in unison. They didn’t all necessarily agree that he should be removed from office, but they did agree that he should be impeached.

archived recording (kamala harris) Our framers imagined this moment — a moment where we would have a corrupt president.

michael barbaro

Right. It seemed like every candidate used some version of the phrase “Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country.” It was almost verbatim.

archived recording (joe biden) This president is the most corrupt president in modern history — archived recording (bernie sanders) In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president — archived recording (tom steyer) — most corrupt president in the country. And that only the voice —

maggie haberman

And look, these candidates have generally tried to avoid having these debates be specifically just about Donald Trump. This was among the most Donald Trump-heavy first 10 minutes of a debate that I can recall.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the —

maggie haberman

But instead of using that moment as a way for any of them to sort of use a back door to criticize Joe Biden over the issue related to his son and the work his son had done in Ukraine while Biden was vice president, they all very pointedly, clearly, did not want to join President Trump’s attacks on Joe Biden.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

maggie haberman

None of them brought it up on their own as the debate went on. The rest of the night was really absent any issue related to Biden except for a question from the moderators.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. If it’s not O.K. for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it O.K. for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden? archived recording (joe biden) Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government.

michael barbaro

And everyone seemed quite ready to avoid it and just move on.

alexander burns

Right. And I think that that reflects a couple of things, right?

archived recording (anderson cooper) Senator Sanders, your response? archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me make a point. I think —

alexander burns

The moderators sort of teed up Bernie Sanders, if he wanted to go after Biden on the Hunter Ukraine issue.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured.

alexander burns

Bernie just totally did not take the bait, and neither did anybody else. And part of that is I think a sense among other Democrats that going at the Hunter issue, you really, really risk sort of triggering sympathy for Biden and looking like you are taking Trump’s side in a fight. And I think maybe as big or a bigger part of it is this calculation by a lot of the candidates on stage who want Joe Biden’s supporters to move over to their camp. That the way to do that is not by attacking Joe Biden and that you kind of got to trust that Biden is going to continue sinking in this race just by the force of gravity and his own limitations as a candidate and present yourself as a compelling alternative for people who are looking for a more moderate or a more conventional set of qualifications. And they do that by going after Elizabeth Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — after that. archived recording (marc lacey) Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for “Medicare for all.” You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?

maggie haberman

And you saw that right away with a question about Medicare for all, which she has been facing repeated questions about and people trying to pin her down.

michael barbaro

Right. There’s first an effort by our colleague, Marc Lacey, to twice pin her down on whether or not her Medicare for all plan would require a tax increase for middle-class voters. She doesn’t really answer the yes or no question.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not —

michael barbaro

Then Pete Buttigieg tries to get her to answer it and on and on. And she’s just kind of resolutely unwilling to say yes or no.

alexander burns

And it’s not even really sort of an ideological attack on her, right? You saw Pete Buttigieg pushing her just to sort of be straight on this question.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out —

alexander burns

It’s almost sort of a character attack as much as anything else. She loves talking about the mechanics of policy and where revenue will come from and where it will go and how regulations work and how it will change the way companies are structured. And the fact that this is the one place where she won’t say what we heard Bernie Sanders say —

archived recording (bernie sanders) Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up.

alexander burns

It would be a super sort of Warren-y answer, except she just doesn’t want to give it.

michael barbaro

And why exactly won’t she answer it, Maggie?

maggie haberman

Well, she won’t answer it because there’s not a great answer to the question. Usually when there is not a great answer to the question, you’ll see a politician do what she is doing, which is evade steadfastly.

archived recording (marc lacey) Senator — Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up? archived recording (elizabeth warren) So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind —

maggie haberman

The answer is most likely to be that there will be a tax hike, and that’s not an answer that she wants to be holding herself to right now. I also think that she’s probably leaving herself a little bit of room — emphasis on a little — for a general election on how she might answer this question of a pay-for for this plan. Her opponent, potentially, Donald Trump, is thrilled seeing her talk about this, because Trump and his advisers believe this is going to be an area where they can really push her and try to shove her closer toward the socialist label that he’s been trying to affix to most Democrats.

michael barbaro

And Alex, what did you think was the most notable exchange inside of this first round of efforts by the moderate Democrats on this stage to come after Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

Look, I thought it was the combination of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both speaking about Warren in terms of honesty.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is —

alexander burns

You heard Klobuchar, who has been so careful so far in this race to be very collegial with her Senate colleagues.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that. And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.

alexander burns

You heard her essentially describe Warren’s plans as a pipe dream.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done, and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers —

alexander burns

This is really harsh stuff, right? This is the kind of criticism that you have heard at other points in the race directed at Joe Biden.

maggie haberman

One thing, too, that I was struck by in Klobuchar’s answer is she more than once said that essentially, to Warren, your way of doing things is not the only way.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t —

michael barbaro

And does that reflect some kind of larger sentiment among these moderate candidates about Warren and about the way that she campaigns?

alexander burns

I think it reflects a resentment among some of the more moderate candidates of the way Warren argues sometimes explicitly, sometimes a little bit more subtly, that if you don’t approach policy the same way she does, it’s because you don’t have political guts. You don’t have grit. You’re not willing to fight —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we’ve — archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — got to stop —

alexander burns

For somebody like Amy Klobuchar, she sees how you get stuff done in government differently. She doesn’t think it makes her a coward. She thinks it sort of just reflects a different set of political values.

michael barbaro

So what’s the next notable exchange?

archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Congressman. archived recording (erin burnett) Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate.

alexander burns

You have this even messier multi-candidate pile-on around Warren’s proposal for a tax on huge private fortunes.

archived recording (erin burnett) Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.

alexander burns

That it sort of begins with this exchange involving Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, the only billionaire on stage, where —

archived recording (erin burnett) What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

alexander burns

— I think there’s an attempt by the moderators to try to draw out Steyer in a way that would maybe stir some tension on stage. And he basically says, look —

archived recording (tom steyer) Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor.

alexander burns

— wealth concentration is a problem. Then the spotlight moves back to some of those moderates we talked about before.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) This is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — to who sounded better on a debate stage — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. archived recording (pete buttigieg) — debate stage or in a committee hearing — archived recording (erin burnett) Senator Klobuchar — Senator Klobuchar — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — versus what it’s actually going to take to get something done. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I want to give a reality che — archived recording (erin burnett) Will a wealth tax work? archived recording (amy klobuchar) It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

alexander burns

You hear Amy Klobuchar not attacking the idea of a wealth tax — she says that she’s open to the idea — but again criticizing Warren for this sense that Warren thinks her ideas are the only good ideas.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that, after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.

alexander burns

Nobody is actually challenging the substance of her policy idea here. And in fact, you hear people across the ideological spectrum in the party either endorsing a wealth tax or at least indicating their openness to a wealth tax.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

alexander burns

So to me, this part is more of a primal scream of frustration towards Elizabeth Warren than a really concerted policy challenge.

michael barbaro

And when you say primal scream of frustration, I’m guessing you don’t just mean the fact that they think she talks about her ideas as if they are the best and the only good ideas, but perhaps because she’s just doing really well?

alexander burns

She is doing really well, right? That if you look back to where this race was when Beto O’Rourke got into it, right, back in the late winter or early spring, he was one of the leading candidates. Elizabeth Warren was at the back of the polls and struggling to sort of find two dimes to rub together for her campaign, right? Now she is one of the biggest fundraisers in the field. He is at the back of the pack, struggling to survive. And you do see — you saw it earlier in the race with Joe Biden. You see it now with Elizabeth Warren. People who are polling towards the back of the pack, trying to have some kind of impact in this race, go after the front-runner.

archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Senator Booker. archived recording (anderson cooper) We’ve got to take a quick break. We’ve got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio. We’ll be right back after this. [APPLAUSE]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording (anderson cooper) And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered —

michael barbaro

So as this debate went on, it felt like we saw the first substantive conversation on foreign policy that I can remember from these Democratic debates, in part, I think, because of the urgency of the situation that’s playing out in Syria. I wonder if it felt that way to both of you.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Vice President Biden, we —

maggie haberman

It didn’t feel that substantive to me, candidly. It felt urgent, and it felt emotional.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership.

maggie haberman

What I think was striking about it is that Joe Biden, who was vice president, seemed to really struggle in his answer to this question about what he would do and what he thought was necessary.

archived recording (joe biden) What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where — he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real locked-down conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now. Pay that price.

maggie haberman

I think that Biden still sounded as if he wasn’t quite sure what to do. And I really thought going into this debate that this was going to be an issue that Biden was going to score lots of points on, because it’s right in his wheelhouse.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s one of the ways that Biden has tried to distinguish himself, by pointing to his experience and his gravitas, especially around matters like foreign policy and military conflict.

archived recording (joe biden) I think I may be — doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan.

alexander burns

Right. You heard him make that argument quite explicitly, that he’s the one person on stage who needs no on-the-job training, that he has dealt with Putin, he has dealt with Erdogan directly. What he struggles with, as Maggie was saying, is communicating that in a way that conveys a sense of command and reassurance to the people who are watching the debate. I did think there were at least the germs of a bigger ideological argument about foreign policy.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this —

alexander burns

You did hear a pretty stark difference between Biden, on the one hand, who, not in a terribly articulate way, talked about keeping American troops in Syria in some fashion, and Elizabeth Warren saying quite directly that she wants to get rid of those troops, just not in the way Donald Trump has gone about doing it.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to get — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no — archived recording (anderson cooper) Yeah. Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — military solution — archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor Buttigieg? archived recording (elizabeth warren) — in this region.

michael barbaro

And Alex, does that ideological breakdown, when it comes to how the United States should use military forces, does that fall along familiar domestic debate ideological fault lines? Or is it different?

alexander burns

It doesn’t map precisely onto the same fault lines as domestic policy, economic policy, health care. But I do think that the more populist wing of the party represented by Warren and Sanders and a couple other people intermittently onstage is much more skeptical of the idea of the United States being involved in foreign wars, of having permanent troop presence overseas. And it is something, Michael, as you obviously recall, that the president played to quite effectively in 2016, is this idea that there actua — there may be a consensus in Washington for the United States to play this kind of role in foreign countries, but in the rest of America, there’s a lot of exhaustion and a lot of skepticism. And that’s part of what I think was so challenging for Biden in this moment, right? That just talking about restoring the bipartisan foreign policy consensus isn’t necessarily super compelling to base primary voters, at least the ones who are voting on foreign policy.

archived recording (anderson cooper) As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.

michael barbaro

So toward the end of the debate, the moderators asked this question that sort of seems to be pointed directly at this central tension that’s been playing out on stage.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump? archived recording (joe biden) Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people.

michael barbaro

I wonder what you make of the answers to that question.

alexander burns

Well, first, I think it’s really striking that the question needed to be asked in this specific way in order to draw Biden into conflict with Warren and Sanders. In past debates, he’s been so eager to go after them on a whole range of policies. In this debate, there were big sections of the night where he seemed to really fade from the foreground of this thing. And the moderators really sort of summon him to rise to this moment as a champion of the center in this race.

archived recording (joe biden) I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done.

alexander burns

He does it by describing himself as the only person on the stage who’s ever gotten big things done. He talks about the Violence Against Women Act. He talks about the Affordable Care Act. And he runs pretty quickly into quite a challenging confrontation with both Bernie Sanders and Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington —

maggie haberman

What ended up happening was Warren starts talking about her accomplishments. She talks about what she did after the 2008 fiscal crisis. She talks about her time at the C.F.P.B. She talks about what she wants to do.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) If we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — for the things that touch people’s lives. archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor — archived recording (joe biden) I agree —

maggie haberman

But you had Biden try to come back at Warren as she’s talking about what she did. He says, “I got you votes.”

archived recording (joe biden) I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight too.

maggie haberman

She sort of lets him finish. And there’s a pause, and you can see her almost drawing breath.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. And I am deeply —

maggie haberman

It’s a real dagger, because it’s a reminder that so much of what Joe Biden has done in this race has been talking about Obama’s record. Biden doesn’t handle that well —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) But understand — archived recording (joe biden) You did a hell of a job at your job. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Thank you. But understand this —

maggie haberman

— gets unhappy about it and pushes back that you did well in the role that you were in, meaning at the C.F.P.B. And there was just silence in the debate hall when he did it. It underscored what I think has been a theme for Biden in this race and certainly throughout the night when he was present onstage, which is it had this aura of don’t you understand that this is my turn, this is what I’m due? And it reminded me so much of what we would see with Hillary Clinton in 2016.

alexander burns

I think it was also just a total mismanagement by Biden of the dynamics of interacting with an emerging female front-runner in this race. That there was really no need, if you look at the record that he is standing on, for him to then try to sort of take a piece of her signature achievement, the creation of this new regulatory agency. And I think it was a reflection of her sort of lack of interest in escalating a fight with him, her sort of view that it didn’t make sense for her to sort of get into an extended fight with Joe Biden, that she didn’t come back at him harder on that front. It was a real role reversal from what we’ve seen in the race previously, where Joe Biden sort of goes from being the hunted to being the hunter as he sort of loses some traction at the top of this race.

archived recording (joe biden) And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who’s going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how are you going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade. archived recording (anderson cooper) Just to clarify —

michael barbaro

Alex, given the sensitive moment that Joe Biden is in right now with the president’s attacks on him and his son, is there an argument to be made that the best thing that could happen to Biden during this debate was kind of exactly what did happen? That he got to kind of hide away a little bit while all the moderates went after somebody else, Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

I think you can make the case that the best-case scenario for Biden at this point is to sort of protect the base that he has right now, hold steady, and trust the rest of the field to stay fractured. And if that’s the best case for him, then maybe that’s what he did tonight. I think it’s a really, really risky strategy, because it counts on everybody else being ineffective at appealing to the voters who are currently supporting you. So I think you could look at this as a low-risk debate for Biden, where he probably didn’t do damage to himself actively. I think you could also see it as a real missed opportunity for a guy who does have unmatched foreign policy credentials on that stage, who has been victimized by the president in a way that has launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump —

michael barbaro

Right.

alexander burns

— and who didn’t sort of wrap all that together and create a bigger moment for his campaign.

maggie haberman

I totally agree.

michael barbaro

michael barbaro Are you on deadline? michael schmidt No. michael barbaro Well, I’m looking for someone to tell me what else I need to know today. michael schmidt Um —

michael schmidt

On Tuesday, George Kent, a senior State Department adviser on Ukraine, went up to Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment proceedings. In Kent’s testimony, he says that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told him not to worry about Ukraine policy. Obviously, a little weird for a State Department official who specializes in Ukraine policy.

michael barbaro

The message being, like, we’ve got Ukraine over here at the White House. You at the State Department, that’s not your issue anymore.

michael schmidt

Yet another odd way that the administration was handling its policy towards Ukraine. In the middle of this testimony, Giuliani himself puts out a letter that says that he is not going to comply with a subpoena from the House. The impeachment investigators want to talk to him. Giuliani says, nope, not coming. This is a sham, and he’s not going to participate.

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording (amy robach) If your last name wasn’t Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma? archived recording (hunter biden) I don’t know. I don’t know. Probably not. I don’t think that there’s a lot of things that would have happened in my life that — if my last name wasn’t Biden.

michael schmidt

The other thing you need to know is that Joe Biden’s son Hunter gave an interview with ABC News this morning in which he took on the attacks that Trump has leveled at him about Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And Giuliani.

michael schmidt

Correct, and Giuliani. And he basically said, was it the best thing that I sat on the board of this energy company in Ukraine? Probably not. But he says that these allegations that Giuliani and Trump have thrown at him and thrown at his father about how his dad intervened to help the energy company, it’s all nonsense. There’s nothing to it.

archived recording (hunter biden) You know what? I’m a human. And you know what? Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based upon some un — ethical lapse? Absolutely not.

Good morning.

michael barbaro

So believe it or not, with you being in Ohio, me in Washington, and this team of editors and producers in New York, this is not exactly a flawless technical operation at 12:35 a.m.

alexander burns

I have faith in your crack team.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] I have faith too. It’s really the technology I’m beginning to question.

alexander burns

Hmm.

michael barbaro

Hmm. O.K., let’s do this. Alex, if you were going to summarize tonight in a sentence, what would it be?

alexander burns

I think this was the night where you really saw the moderate candidates on stage find their thirst for combat. And I think, interestingly, you saw that displayed not by folks like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar going after Joe Biden, the leading moderate candidate at this point in the race, but you saw it happen by them going after Elizabeth Warren to try to sort of prove their centrist credentials by challenging the left.

michael barbaro

Right. The front-runner who’s not actually quite the front-runner. I checked the polls right before the debate and by all accounts, statistically speaking, that is Joe Biden.

alexander burns

In an average of national polls, Joe Biden has a slight lead over Elizabeth Warren still in this race. But every other candidate in the race can read those trend lines just like we can. She is moving steadily up. He is moving steadily down. And the picture is even more pronounced in the early voting states, like Iowa and New Hampshire. So if you are a Pete Buttigieg or an Amy Klobuchar and you have staked your candidacy on a breakthrough in the Midwest, it is a bigger issue for you to get past Joe Biden and present yourself as a clear, compelling alternative to Elizabeth Warren than it is to go at Joe Biden directly.

michael barbaro

O.K., so let’s talk about how that actually played out.

archived recording (anderson cooper) This is the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate.

maggie haberman

So all 12 candidates are on stage. The debate begins.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support.

maggie haberman

The first question inevitably is about impeachment. This is the first debate since the impeachment inquiry began.

archived recording (anderson cooper) But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.

maggie haberman

And you had all 12 candidates in agreement —

archived recording (bernie sanders) I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment.

maggie haberman

— that they believe that Donald Trump should be impeached.

archived recording (joe biden) They would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.

maggie haberman

This is a big change from where things were within this Democratic field even a month ago.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment.

maggie haberman

And everybody was in unison. They didn’t all necessarily agree that he should be removed from office, but they did agree that he should be impeached.

archived recording (kamala harris) Our framers imagined this moment — a moment where we would have a corrupt president.

michael barbaro

Right. It seemed like every candidate used some version of the phrase “Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country.” It was almost verbatim.

archived recording (joe biden) This president is the most corrupt president in modern history — archived recording (bernie sanders) In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president — archived recording (tom steyer) — most corrupt president in the country. And that only the voice —

maggie haberman

And look, these candidates have generally tried to avoid having these debates be specifically just about Donald Trump. This was among the most Donald Trump-heavy first 10 minutes of a debate that I can recall.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the —

maggie haberman

But instead of using that moment as a way for any of them to sort of use a back door to criticize Joe Biden over the issue related to his son and the work his son had done in Ukraine while Biden was vice president, they all very pointedly, clearly, did not want to join President Trump’s attacks on Joe Biden.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

maggie haberman

None of them brought it up on their own as the debate went on. The rest of the night was really absent any issue related to Biden except for a question from the moderators.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. If it’s not O.K. for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it O.K. for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden? archived recording (joe biden) Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government.

michael barbaro

And everyone seemed quite ready to avoid it and just move on.

alexander burns

Right. And I think that that reflects a couple of things, right?

archived recording (anderson cooper) Senator Sanders, your response? archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me make a point. I think —

alexander burns

The moderators sort of teed up Bernie Sanders, if he wanted to go after Biden on the Hunter Ukraine issue.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured.

alexander burns

Bernie just totally did not take the bait, and neither did anybody else. And part of that is I think a sense among other Democrats that going at the Hunter issue, you really, really risk sort of triggering sympathy for Biden and looking like you are taking Trump’s side in a fight. And I think maybe as big or a bigger part of it is this calculation by a lot of the candidates on stage who want Joe Biden’s supporters to move over to their camp. That the way to do that is not by attacking Joe Biden and that you kind of got to trust that Biden is going to continue sinking in this race just by the force of gravity and his own limitations as a candidate and present yourself as a compelling alternative for people who are looking for a more moderate or a more conventional set of qualifications. And they do that by going after Elizabeth Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — after that. archived recording (marc lacey) Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for “Medicare for all.” You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?

maggie haberman

And you saw that right away with a question about Medicare for all, which she has been facing repeated questions about and people trying to pin her down.

michael barbaro

Right. There’s first an effort by our colleague, Marc Lacey, to twice pin her down on whether or not her Medicare for all plan would require a tax increase for middle-class voters. She doesn’t really answer the yes or no question.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not —

michael barbaro

Then Pete Buttigieg tries to get her to answer it and on and on. And she’s just kind of resolutely unwilling to say yes or no.

alexander burns

And it’s not even really sort of an ideological attack on her, right? You saw Pete Buttigieg pushing her just to sort of be straight on this question.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out —

alexander burns

It’s almost sort of a character attack as much as anything else. She loves talking about the mechanics of policy and where revenue will come from and where it will go and how regulations work and how it will change the way companies are structured. And the fact that this is the one place where she won’t say what we heard Bernie Sanders say —

archived recording (bernie sanders) Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up.

alexander burns

It would be a super sort of Warren-y answer, except she just doesn’t want to give it.

michael barbaro

And why exactly won’t she answer it, Maggie?

maggie haberman

Well, she won’t answer it because there’s not a great answer to the question. Usually when there is not a great answer to the question, you’ll see a politician do what she is doing, which is evade steadfastly.

archived recording (marc lacey) Senator — Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up? archived recording (elizabeth warren) So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind —

maggie haberman

The answer is most likely to be that there will be a tax hike, and that’s not an answer that she wants to be holding herself to right now. I also think that she’s probably leaving herself a little bit of room — emphasis on a little — for a general election on how she might answer this question of a pay-for for this plan. Her opponent, potentially, Donald Trump, is thrilled seeing her talk about this, because Trump and his advisers believe this is going to be an area where they can really push her and try to shove her closer toward the socialist label that he’s been trying to affix to most Democrats.

michael barbaro

And Alex, what did you think was the most notable exchange inside of this first round of efforts by the moderate Democrats on this stage to come after Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

Look, I thought it was the combination of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both speaking about Warren in terms of honesty.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is —

alexander burns

You heard Klobuchar, who has been so careful so far in this race to be very collegial with her Senate colleagues.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that. And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.

alexander burns

You heard her essentially describe Warren’s plans as a pipe dream.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done, and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers —

alexander burns

This is really harsh stuff, right? This is the kind of criticism that you have heard at other points in the race directed at Joe Biden.

maggie haberman

One thing, too, that I was struck by in Klobuchar’s answer is she more than once said that essentially, to Warren, your way of doing things is not the only way.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t —

michael barbaro

And does that reflect some kind of larger sentiment among these moderate candidates about Warren and about the way that she campaigns?

alexander burns

I think it reflects a resentment among some of the more moderate candidates of the way Warren argues sometimes explicitly, sometimes a little bit more subtly, that if you don’t approach policy the same way she does, it’s because you don’t have political guts. You don’t have grit. You’re not willing to fight —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we’ve — archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — got to stop —

alexander burns

For somebody like Amy Klobuchar, she sees how you get stuff done in government differently. She doesn’t think it makes her a coward. She thinks it sort of just reflects a different set of political values.

michael barbaro

So what’s the next notable exchange?

archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Congressman. archived recording (erin burnett) Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate.

alexander burns

You have this even messier multi-candidate pile-on around Warren’s proposal for a tax on huge private fortunes.

archived recording (erin burnett) Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.

alexander burns

That it sort of begins with this exchange involving Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, the only billionaire on stage, where —

archived recording (erin burnett) What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

alexander burns

— I think there’s an attempt by the moderators to try to draw out Steyer in a way that would maybe stir some tension on stage. And he basically says, look —

archived recording (tom steyer) Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor.

alexander burns

— wealth concentration is a problem. Then the spotlight moves back to some of those moderates we talked about before.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) This is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — to who sounded better on a debate stage — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. archived recording (pete buttigieg) — debate stage or in a committee hearing — archived recording (erin burnett) Senator Klobuchar — Senator Klobuchar — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — versus what it’s actually going to take to get something done. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I want to give a reality che — archived recording (erin burnett) Will a wealth tax work? archived recording (amy klobuchar) It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

alexander burns

You hear Amy Klobuchar not attacking the idea of a wealth tax — she says that she’s open to the idea — but again criticizing Warren for this sense that Warren thinks her ideas are the only good ideas.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that, after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.

alexander burns

Nobody is actually challenging the substance of her policy idea here. And in fact, you hear people across the ideological spectrum in the party either endorsing a wealth tax or at least indicating their openness to a wealth tax.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

alexander burns

So to me, this part is more of a primal scream of frustration towards Elizabeth Warren than a really concerted policy challenge.

michael barbaro

And when you say primal scream of frustration, I’m guessing you don’t just mean the fact that they think she talks about her ideas as if they are the best and the only good ideas, but perhaps because she’s just doing really well?

alexander burns

She is doing really well, right? That if you look back to where this race was when Beto O’Rourke got into it, right, back in the late winter or early spring, he was one of the leading candidates. Elizabeth Warren was at the back of the polls and struggling to sort of find two dimes to rub together for her campaign, right? Now she is one of the biggest fundraisers in the field. He is at the back of the pack, struggling to survive. And you do see — you saw it earlier in the race with Joe Biden. You see it now with Elizabeth Warren. People who are polling towards the back of the pack, trying to have some kind of impact in this race, go after the front-runner.

archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Senator Booker. archived recording (anderson cooper) We’ve got to take a quick break. We’ve got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio. We’ll be right back after this. [APPLAUSE]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording (anderson cooper) And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered —

michael barbaro

So as this debate went on, it felt like we saw the first substantive conversation on foreign policy that I can remember from these Democratic debates, in part, I think, because of the urgency of the situation that’s playing out in Syria. I wonder if it felt that way to both of you.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Vice President Biden, we —

maggie haberman

It didn’t feel that substantive to me, candidly. It felt urgent, and it felt emotional.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership.

maggie haberman

What I think was striking about it is that Joe Biden, who was vice president, seemed to really struggle in his answer to this question about what he would do and what he thought was necessary.

archived recording (joe biden) What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where — he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real locked-down conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now. Pay that price.

maggie haberman

I think that Biden still sounded as if he wasn’t quite sure what to do. And I really thought going into this debate that this was going to be an issue that Biden was going to score lots of points on, because it’s right in his wheelhouse.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s one of the ways that Biden has tried to distinguish himself, by pointing to his experience and his gravitas, especially around matters like foreign policy and military conflict.

archived recording (joe biden) I think I may be — doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan.

alexander burns

Right. You heard him make that argument quite explicitly, that he’s the one person on stage who needs no on-the-job training, that he has dealt with Putin, he has dealt with Erdogan directly. What he struggles with, as Maggie was saying, is communicating that in a way that conveys a sense of command and reassurance to the people who are watching the debate. I did think there were at least the germs of a bigger ideological argument about foreign policy.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this —

alexander burns

You did hear a pretty stark difference between Biden, on the one hand, who, not in a terribly articulate way, talked about keeping American troops in Syria in some fashion, and Elizabeth Warren saying quite directly that she wants to get rid of those troops, just not in the way Donald Trump has gone about doing it.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to get — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no — archived recording (anderson cooper) Yeah. Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — military solution — archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor Buttigieg? archived recording (elizabeth warren) — in this region.

michael barbaro

And Alex, does that ideological breakdown, when it comes to how the United States should use military forces, does that fall along familiar domestic debate ideological fault lines? Or is it different?

alexander burns

It doesn’t map precisely onto the same fault lines as domestic policy, economic policy, health care. But I do think that the more populist wing of the party represented by Warren and Sanders and a couple other people intermittently onstage is much more skeptical of the idea of the United States being involved in foreign wars, of having permanent troop presence overseas. And it is something, Michael, as you obviously recall, that the president played to quite effectively in 2016, is this idea that there actua — there may be a consensus in Washington for the United States to play this kind of role in foreign countries, but in the rest of America, there’s a lot of exhaustion and a lot of skepticism. And that’s part of what I think was so challenging for Biden in this moment, right? That just talking about restoring the bipartisan foreign policy consensus isn’t necessarily super compelling to base primary voters, at least the ones who are voting on foreign policy.

archived recording (anderson cooper) As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.

michael barbaro

So toward the end of the debate, the moderators asked this question that sort of seems to be pointed directly at this central tension that’s been playing out on stage.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump? archived recording (joe biden) Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people.

michael barbaro

I wonder what you make of the answers to that question.

alexander burns

Well, first, I think it’s really striking that the question needed to be asked in this specific way in order to draw Biden into conflict with Warren and Sanders. In past debates, he’s been so eager to go after them on a whole range of policies. In this debate, there were big sections of the night where he seemed to really fade from the foreground of this thing. And the moderators really sort of summon him to rise to this moment as a champion of the center in this race.

archived recording (joe biden) I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done.

alexander burns

He does it by describing himself as the only person on the stage who’s ever gotten big things done. He talks about the Violence Against Women Act. He talks about the Affordable Care Act. And he runs pretty quickly into quite a challenging confrontation with both Bernie Sanders and Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington —

maggie haberman

What ended up happening was Warren starts talking about her accomplishments. She talks about what she did after the 2008 fiscal crisis. She talks about her time at the C.F.P.B. She talks about what she wants to do.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) If we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — for the things that touch people’s lives. archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor — archived recording (joe biden) I agree —

maggie haberman

But you had Biden try to come back at Warren as she’s talking about what she did. He says, “I got you votes.”

archived recording (joe biden) I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight too.

maggie haberman

She sort of lets him finish. And there’s a pause, and you can see her almost drawing breath.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. And I am deeply —

maggie haberman

It’s a real dagger, because it’s a reminder that so much of what Joe Biden has done in this race has been talking about Obama’s record. Biden doesn’t handle that well —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) But understand — archived recording (joe biden) You did a hell of a job at your job. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Thank you. But understand this —

maggie haberman

— gets unhappy about it and pushes back that you did well in the role that you were in, meaning at the C.F.P.B. And there was just silence in the debate hall when he did it. It underscored what I think has been a theme for Biden in this race and certainly throughout the night when he was present onstage, which is it had this aura of don’t you understand that this is my turn, this is what I’m due? And it reminded me so much of what we would see with Hillary Clinton in 2016.

alexander burns

I think it was also just a total mismanagement by Biden of the dynamics of interacting with an emerging female front-runner in this race. That there was really no need, if you look at the record that he is standing on, for him to then try to sort of take a piece of her signature achievement, the creation of this new regulatory agency. And I think it was a reflection of her sort of lack of interest in escalating a fight with him, her sort of view that it didn’t make sense for her to sort of get into an extended fight with Joe Biden, that she didn’t come back at him harder on that front. It was a real role reversal from what we’ve seen in the race previously, where Joe Biden sort of goes from being the hunted to being the hunter as he sort of loses some traction at the top of this race.

archived recording (joe biden) And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who’s going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how are you going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade. archived recording (anderson cooper) Just to clarify —

michael barbaro

Alex, given the sensitive moment that Joe Biden is in right now with the president’s attacks on him and his son, is there an argument to be made that the best thing that could happen to Biden during this debate was kind of exactly what did happen? That he got to kind of hide away a little bit while all the moderates went after somebody else, Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

I think you can make the case that the best-case scenario for Biden at this point is to sort of protect the base that he has right now, hold steady, and trust the rest of the field to stay fractured. And if that’s the best case for him, then maybe that’s what he did tonight. I think it’s a really, really risky strategy, because it counts on everybody else being ineffective at appealing to the voters who are currently supporting you. So I think you could look at this as a low-risk debate for Biden, where he probably didn’t do damage to himself actively. I think you could also see it as a real missed opportunity for a guy who does have unmatched foreign policy credentials on that stage, who has been victimized by the president in a way that has launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump —

michael barbaro

Right.

alexander burns

— and who didn’t sort of wrap all that together and create a bigger moment for his campaign.

maggie haberman

I totally agree.

michael barbaro Are you on deadline? michael schmidt No. michael barbaro Well, I’m looking for someone to tell me what else I need to know today. michael schmidt Um —

michael schmidt

On Tuesday, George Kent, a senior State Department adviser on Ukraine, went up to Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment proceedings. In Kent’s testimony, he says that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told him not to worry about Ukraine policy. Obviously, a little weird for a State Department official who specializes in Ukraine policy.

michael barbaro

The message being, like, we’ve got Ukraine over here at the White House. You at the State Department, that’s not your issue anymore.

michael schmidt

Yet another odd way that the administration was handling its policy towards Ukraine. In the middle of this testimony, Giuliani himself puts out a letter that says that he is not going to comply with a subpoena from the House. The impeachment investigators want to talk to him. Giuliani says, nope, not coming. This is a sham, and he’s not going to participate.

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording (amy robach) If your last name wasn’t Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma? archived recording (hunter biden) I don’t know. I don’t know. Probably not. I don’t think that there’s a lot of things that would have happened in my life that — if my last name wasn’t Biden.

michael schmidt

The other thing you need to know is that Joe Biden’s son Hunter gave an interview with ABC News this morning in which he took on the attacks that Trump has leveled at him about Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And Giuliani.

michael schmidt

Correct, and Giuliani. And he basically said, was it the best thing that I sat on the board of this energy company in Ukraine? Probably not. But he says that these allegations that Giuliani and Trump have thrown at him and thrown at his father about how his dad intervened to help the energy company, it’s all nonsense. There’s nothing to it.

archived recording (hunter biden) You know what? I’m a human. And you know what? Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based upon some un — ethical lapse? Absolutely not.

204,Frank Bruni,"Maybe thats smart politics. But its not great leadership.

It Was the Worst of Warren.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/opinion/democratic-debate-ohio.html,"She was referring to Tom Steyer, who was making his Democratic-debate debut.

Warren said that she had nothing against billionaires per se and wasn’t in the demonization business. She was in the justice business. And with her final remarks, she sought to underscore that with praise for a prominent Republican ally of the first President Bush. She also noted that two of her three brothers were Republicans and that she loved them very much.

The third reason I appreciated this debate is because it so perfectly underscored the most prominent candidates’ rationales for running and arguments for themselves. Apart from that odd exchange with Warren, Biden had a decent night, partly because he was given, and took advantage of, several opportunities to stress that he was more prepared for the presidency than anyone else and that the post-Trump era called for someone who wouldn’t have a steep learning curve. The repair work must begin immediately.

Buttigieg made clear that what he offers, at the tender age of 37, is a truly fresh perspective. He had a superb night, because he embraced a role as Warren’s inquisitor and because several supremely eloquent remarks about foreign policy — in particular, about Trump’s withdrawal of American troops from Syria — allowed him to project a command and maturity that some voters needed to see to consider him seriously.

Cory Booker quintupled down on his pitch as the candidate of love — and was so expansively loving to several of the other Democrats, including Kamala Harris and Biden, that I found myself wondering if this debate was a bid to salvage a flagging campaign or the beginning of an audition to be the eventual nominee’s running mate. As for Harris, she had strong moments, but they were neither strong nor frequent enough to alter her fortunes.

This was the most crowded televised presidential debate ever, with 12 candidates, so I’d need the column equivalent of “War and Peace” to appraise all of them. Still I’d feel remiss if I didn’t note that Sanders, who recently suffered a heart attack, seemed no less vigorous than he had before.

But Warren, not Sanders, was carrying the progressive mantle on Tuesday night, when her less liberal competitors sought with a new assertiveness to trip her up. I don’t think that they quite succeeded.

Warren exits this latest debate as strong as she entered it. And those of us who watched it understand her — the calculations behind her positioning, the potential miscalculations of her monumentally expensive plans and the profound conviction she summons — better than ever before. That’s no small payoff for three long hours.

Fourth, there is a wave of insular intolerance coursing through parts of the American left. If given executive power, some progressives may use it to cancel any culture or faith other than their own.

And yet ….

And yet, if it comes to Trump vs. Warren in a general election, the only plausible choice is to support Warren. Over the past month Donald Trump has given us fresh reminders of the unique and exceptional ways he corrupts American life. You’re either part of removing that corruption or you are not. When your nation’s political system is in danger, staying home and not voting is not a responsible option.

Politics is downstream from morality and culture. Warren represents a policy wrong turn, in my view, but policies can be argued about and reversed. Trump represents a much more important and fundamental threat — to the norms, values, standards and soul of this country.

Last week, Trump all but greenlighted the ethnic cleansing of Kurds without an ounce of remorse. He normalizes dishonesty and valorizes cruelty. His letter to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reminds us yet again that we have a president whose professional competence is at kindergarten level. Once a nation has lost its heart, mind and soul, it is very hard to get these things back.

Furthermore, Trump is an unprecedented threat to democratic institutions. Over the past few years, I’ve thought the progressive fears of incipient American fascism were vastly overblown. But, especially over the past month, Trump has worked overtime to validate those fears and to raise the horrifying specter of what he’ll be like if he is given a second term and is vindicated , unhinged and unwell.

In their book “How Democracies Die,” Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt argue that authoritarians undermine democracy in several ways. They reject the democratic rules of the game, the unwritten norms we rely upon to make the political system work. They deny the legitimacy of their political opponents, using extreme language to deny them standing as co-citizens. They tolerate or even encourage violence, threatening to take legal action against critics in rival parties."

It is very striking how quickly the Democratic field has consolidated.

Then it’s “The Argument’s” first anniversary. Michelle, Ross, and I take a moment to reflect on how our own opinions have changed over the years.

Although I didn’t necessarily take very much of what my parents had told me about politics for granted, for some reason, I sort of accepted this view that I kind of inherited.

david leonhardt

And finally, a recommendation.

michelle goldberg

It feels like something very new and very of the moment. And if you have a chance to go see it, you really should.

david leonhardt

Twelve Democratic candidates took the debate stage on Tuesday, but much of the focus was on just one: Elizabeth Warren. She received the bulk of the criticism from other candidates. Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar each made the implicit case that Warren wasn’t a good candidate to win Midwestern swing states, and they specifically criticized her unwillingness to explain the details of her “Medicare for all” plan and whether it would require middle class tax increases.

pete buttigieg Your signature, senator, to have a plan for everything, except this. amy klobuchar The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done.

david leonhardt

Michelle, I think Ross and I both think this question of the tax increases is a legitimate question for her to answer, and I think you find it more frustrating. So let’s start there.

michelle goldberg

I’m extraordinarily irritated in both directions because I do think this hectoring on her to say I will raise taxes in order to pass this plan that will lower costs, to get her to say those words, I will raise taxes, is basically a demand that she give Republicans a talking point that they can use in advertising. I mean, they basically have made this a focus of every single Democratic debate so far and yet, the fact that she hasn’t figured out how to finesse it also terrifies me because it’s nevertheless going to keep on coming. And it’s obviously going to keep on coming in a general election. And she has to figure out a way to answer it without being evasive. And here, I think she might have sort of backed herself into a corner by embracing Bernie’s plan without coming out with a plan of her own, which I really hope she does soon because she ends up having to answer for a lot of details of a plan that she was never responsible for creating.

ross douthat

Yeah, I mean, I agree with you that the sort of moderator approach that we’ve seen for years and years and years of “Democrat, admit you’re going to raise taxes,” is this sort of performative toughness that I don’t think is actually that tough or that interesting. I think the problem here is that her plan has this massive real-world weakness, which is —

michelle goldberg

Well, she doesn’t have a plan yet, right?

david leonhardt

She doesn’t have a plan, but what she’s committed to has a massive real-world weakness, which is she has embraced this idea of taking private health insurance away from people and putting everyone in Medicare. And while focusing on just the tax part of that is too narrow, it is true that she hasn’t in any way answered the questions of how are you actually going to pass this unpopular plan that’s going to force people to give up their private health insurance and yes, force them to pay higher taxes, even if that’s not the most important part of it. Ross, this scares me, but do you disagree with anything I just said there?

ross douthat

No, I thought that Warren generally was fine on the debate stage last night. But I think her approach to what is on paper the biggest of all her big ideas, even if, as Michelle says, she doesn’t actually have the formal plan yet, it’s not really an effective approach. And it’s a particularly weird approach, given that she is standing right next to Bernie Sanders. And it’s made stranger by the fact that Warren is now arguably the frontrunner, and she’s the frontrunner on the basis of the claim, which is a powerful claim for a lot of Democrats, that you can do bigger things as a liberal and you should champion bigger programs as a liberal. But everyone in politics knows that if Elizabeth Warren is elected president, she’s not actually going to be passing a Medicare for all bill in her first term.

michelle goldberg

Sorry, can I just interrupt? Because I actually don’t think it’s true that she sees Medicare for all, or her campaign sees Medicare for all, as their biggest project or their biggest plan.

ross douthat

But that only makes it weirder.

michelle goldberg

I think that the thing that they are going to be focused on is probably going to be this wealth tax and all of these social programs, you know, universal pre-K and college debt forgiveness and the like that could be paid for by the wealth tax, right? That’s the plan. I don’t think that Democrats expect Medicare for all to be the first thing that a Warren administration tries to enact.

ross douthat

Right, but again, I guess to me that just makes it even weirder still, right? I mean, imagine, what would be a sort of Republican version of this, right? It would be a world where there were a couple of candidates on the right who were advocating social security privatization on the scale that Grover Norquist or someone like that has always wanted to see. And one of these campaigns was sort of all in for this and had this blueprint for how you would do it. And then another candidate would endorse that without having their own version of the plan but then say, oh, don’t worry guys, I’m technically running on this massively unpopular social security privatization, but really if I’m elected, I’m going to focus on normal Republican priorities like middle class tax cuts and tax cuts for businesses. I don’t know, it’s just a strange situation for the Warren campaign to have found itself in where if you’re embracing the Sanders’ plan, that’s a really big deal and a really big gamble. And you can’t just wave it away by saying, actually, we’re going to use a wealth tax to pay for universal pre-K, right?

michelle goldberg

Right, no. I mean, I think they’ve sort of allowed themselves to get trapped. And there’s other candidates on that stage that also backed Bernie’s plan. And you know, in a way, like one of the things that people who love Warren love about Warren is that she doesn’t say stuff that she doesn’t believe and she’s really earnest and forthright. But it’s too risky for something that they’re not actually even going to do.

david leonhardt

O.K., well we shouldn’t make the same mistake that the debates have been making and spend way too much time on Medicare, so we’ll spend only a little bit too much time on it. I’d be interested in what you both thought about Joe Biden. I mean, it’s true. Look, his polling just doesn’t fall. Ross, I know you keep emphasizing this, but it is really hard to look at him and not be anxious. I mean, that whole little riff he went on where at first he said he was going to get rid of the capital gains tax, and it’s fine, we all misspeak. Then he said, no, no, I’m going to double it. And then he said something about people clipping coupons in the stock market? I mean, are we too much in the Twitter bubble, and is there a world in which most Americans look at that and think it’s just fine and Biden actually wins the nomination and is going to be O.K.? Because I don’t really completely see it at this point.

ross douthat

I would be interested in a poll or a study showing what share of each candidate’s supporters are watching these debates because one of my guesses is that Biden support skews towards Democratic voters in constituencies who are least likely to sit down and block out three hours on a weekday night. There is a possibility that the things that all of us are seeing from Biden, people who are planning to vote for him just aren’t seeing it because they have better things to do with their life at the moment. Does that seem plausible to you guys?

Well, you know, it does, but I also don’t think that it’s correct to say that it’s just people in a Twitter bubble who are concerned about this. I mean, you see in Iowa where ordinary people are super attuned to what’s going on in politics and go and see candidates multiple times. You’ve seen his support in Iowa really go down, and now his campaign is basically conceding it and saying, they don’t expect to win Iowa, they don’t expect to win New Hampshire. So I do think the more people see Biden the more anxious they get about his ability to stand up to Trump.

ross douthat

I mean, to me, what’s striking, and I’m hardly the first person to write about this, but it is very striking how quickly the Democratic field has consolidated and the extent to which Biden’s place in the race has made it really hard for a whole range of candidates who seem like they could be electable candidates who are somewhat closer to the center than Warren and Sanders to get oxygen and attention and win votes. And you know, you could see both Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar trying to sort of pivot off Warren last night and presumably try to pick up some of those voters in Iowa who may be abandoning Biden. You know, there’s a window there where you could imagine Biden fades in Iowa as people pay close attention, and the non-Warren, non-Sanders vote coalesces around a Buttigieg or a Klobuchar, but it hasn’t happened yet. And if Warren wins Iowa, then it’s basically just Warren and Biden.

michelle goldberg

Well, I don’t know because I think my guess is that Warren will win Iowa, but then what if Mayor Pete ends up being in the top three, which I think is a completely plausible scenario?

ross douthat

Then he’s got the Lamar Alexander path to victory. [GOLDBERG LAUGHS] I mean, I think he needs to be in the top two. I joked about Lamar, but you really don’t want to be in the Marco Rubio lane of like, well, we’re going to come in third in Iowa and second in New Hampshire. [DOUTHAT and GOLDBERG LAUGH] Because Buttigieg is not going to win South Carolina, right? So I don’t know. David, what do you think?

david leonhardt

Well, I do think there’s one way in which third place is O.K. So the person we’ve talked the least about is Bernie Sanders, and I know a lot of Bernie’s supporters are extremely frustrated that he doesn’t get more attention. I just don’t see a path for him. I know he’s got about a fifth of the Democratic electorate who love him. I know he got more than that last time around because of the discomfort that people had with Hillary. But I do see a path in which Warren or Sanders wins Iowa, the other one finishes second, and Biden really fades. And I think if Buttigieg or Klobuchar can beat Biden, then I think they’re still in it. Because I think then you have a path to winning New Hampshire. And even if that candidate doesn’t win South Carolina, I do think there is a path in which a more moderate candidate comes out of Iowa as the top more moderate candidate.

ross douthat

Yeah, I guess that’s right. If Biden dropped to, like, fifth in Iowa, then you’re into sort of free-for-all territory in New Hampshire and anyone who finishes ahead of him could presumably have a chance. Then presumably, his support in South Carolina takes some kind of hit.

david leonhardt

Yeah. It’s really not clear. I just think there is a long slog, potentially, for a more moderate candidate and a more progressive candidate. And we all assume that’s Biden, and I think it’s overwhelmingly likely to be Biden, particularly when you think about the history. People weren’t that excited about Mondale, but he got the nomination. People weren’t that excited about Gore, but he beat Bill Bradley. People weren’t that excited about John Kerry, but he beat Howard Dean. I mean, there really is a very large pool of Democratic voters.

michelle goldberg

Right, but I feel like people are very attuned to that history. People see that. They were scarred by Hillary Clinton. They were scarred by John Kerry. So they might slouch towards the same kind of outcome. But I think that there’s a significant number of Democrats who see that exact dynamic and are determined to head it off.

ross douthat

And there’s also a media effect where, and you guys can tell me if you disagree, the center-left press, sort of accepting the pro-Bernie socialist wing, has decided that it’s Warren. They don’t want to sort of open it up for Klobuchar, Booker or whoever.

michelle goldberg

But who do you mean by the center-left press?

ross douthat

No, I’m talking about a mix of reporters and pundits at publications like ours and the CNN-New York Times-Washington Post world.

michelle goldberg

But you know, but that wasn’t necessarily true a few months ago. It’s not that her support is following the favorable feelings. It’s that people see that she’s drawing these enormous, enthusiastic crowds, that she’s able to survive all of these slings that Trump throws at her. And so the kind of favorable coverage follows the favorable performance.

ross douthat

Yeah, yeah. I’m not I’m not claiming that the media has rigged it for Warren. I think she’s run a strong campaign, and people are reacting to that. But I think, you know, there’s a feedback effect where that then becomes a built-in advantage for her. I also think the media is a little unfair to Sanders in the way that it treats him, vis-à-vis Warren.

david leonhardt

I mean, I guess Ross, I would say, I think, look, obviously, most journalists are left of center. But there’s also, I think, a bias in journalism toward compromise and toward bipartisanship. And I think we saw George W. Bush and Barack Obama in very different ways get positive coverage because of that bias toward compromise and bipartisanship. And so I actually think, to the extent that such a thing as a media establishment exists, it is uncomfortable with Warren’s more ideological approach and her more populist approach. But she is arguably the only candidate running a really good campaign. And if you’re going to add a second, it would be Bernie Sanders. And so we’re in this strange moment in which there are candidates who acknowledge the existence of swing voters and are trying to figure out ways to win them over and there are candidates running effective campaigns. And right now, the overlap between those two groups in the Democratic Party is zero, and that’s what worries me.

michelle goldberg

Wait, no, I don’t think that’s true because I think that there are certain sorts of Obama to Trump swing voters who are probably pretty receptive to a left-wing economic populist message that is kind of wholeheartedly against the billionaire class, against free trade deals. Those aren’t the people that she is laser targeting, but I do think that our conception in the media of who swing voters are, we tend to think more often of like Romney to Hillary voters. But there are a lot of people who didn’t vote for Romney because of that 47 percent crack who really hate corporate consolidation, who really hate a lot of the things that Elizabeth Warren is running foursquare against who I think, at least theoretically, could be open to her message.

david leonhardt

I totally agree that, Michelle. I just think that when you add on banning private health insurance, banning fracking, and decriminalizing the border that you’re starting to lose a bunch of those voters. I think Warren and Sanders are really good at appealing to those voters in the way that they’re deeply progressive on economic issues. I don’t think they’ve shown any instinct for tacking back to the center on anything. And on some issues, those voters are not way on the left. That’s all I’m saying.

ross douthat

I mean, I would only say, you know, I basically agree with David. But the polls that we have right now I think show both Bernie and Warren sort of performing equally to Biden. The Warren-Sanders case that they can win swing voters as well as Biden has not been disconfirmed by current general election polling.

david leonhardt

O.K., we will leave it there. A couple of weeks ago, we discussed the perils of airplane travel. I talked about my literal pet peeve, pets masquerading as service animals. Ross suggested that airlines make a family section so parents can sit together and help each other out. And Michelle took on manspreading.

michelle goldberg So they always take both armrests. They always spread their legs. I’ve taken photos of, like, my backpack is under the seat in front of me, and the man next to me has his foot on it.

david leonhardt

And by the way, Michelle, you actually e-mailed us a photo of that backpack after our taping as proof, which we appreciated.

michelle goldberg

Yeah, I have a chronic fear of kind of not being believed when I describe what it is like to be a woman in this world.

david leonhardt

Well, we got a lot of voicemails on this topic, so we’re going to go ahead and play a few now.

audience voicemail Hi, my name is Norbert. Hi, my name is Scott. I’m calling from Cincinnati. Hey, guys. This is Peter from Oak Park, Illinois. I enjoyed very much your comments, Michelle, regarding difficulties with male passengers on air flights. Men are not immune from the problems you have encountered. I know men are pretty awful generally, but Michelle was a bit off in only blaming us brutes. So now I wanted to volunteer to fly next to Michelle wherever she goes, and I promise I wouldn’t violate any of her airspace or otherwise. [GOLDBERG LAUGHS]

david leonhardt

So I guess that raises the question, have you ever, either of you, experienced this kind of aggressive physical space claiming from a woman on a flight, as one of our callers suggested?

michelle goldberg

So I definitely haven’t. And I think the thing I would emphasize is that it’s not because men are always larger, although men on average are larger. Because when I sit next to a very large woman, what she almost inevitably does is push her legs together, fold her elbows in, tries to make herself as small as possible.

ross douthat

But Michelle, oh my god, I have to tell you. I was on a flight, a long flight, last week. And the guy in the middle, who was already on the plane before me, I would say he was extended two inches into my seat already. Either I had to yield a large portion of my seat to this guy or essentially spend the entire flight with my elbow up against his. And I just felt like—

michelle goldberg

Welcome to my world.

ross douthat

Yeah, exactly.

michelle goldberg

I’m actually shocked, though. I mean, I totally did not think that that was something that men did to other men.

ross douthat

The male-on-male conflict over the armrest zone is sort of a chronic feature of long flights. Like, you know, I’m the alpha male. I put both my elbows and my middle seat armrest.

david leonhardt

O.K, well thanks to all of our listeners who called in on this topic. We love to hear from you. Leave us a voicemail at 347-915-4324 on airline etiquette or anything else. You can also email us at Argument@NYTimes.com. And we’ll be back after the break. This month marks “The Argument’s” first birthday. We started this show a year ago when the country felt as polarized as it had been in a very long time, and that certainly hasn’t changed since then. Impeachment is now in the news, and another presidential election is looming. But we created this show as a place where people from different parts of the political spectrum could hear each other out. Michelle, Ross, and I have certainly done a lot of hearing each other out in the last year, and now we’d like to take a minute to talk about how our own views have changed over the years as opinion columnists and just as people. I’m going to go first. I would say that over the course of roughly the 1990s, my views on economic policy, which is where I’ve spent the most of my time as a journalist working, moved to what might be called the political right, that I really came to see more of the importance of markets and how markets work, often in ways that other places don’t. I’m more positive about airline deregulation than a lot of people are. I’m more positive about school reform than a lot of people are. And then I would say that over the last decade or so, the 21st century, other parts of my economic views have moved to the left. Because when I look around and I see this crisis of net worth for the typical American family still being lower than it was at the start of the century, life expectancy falling, which I find shocking, the general views that people in the country think things are going wrong, I don’t think tweaks like a little minimum wage increase or an earned-income tax credit are enough to deal with what I think is a crisis in living standards. And so I am much more sympathetic to bigger tax increases on the wealthy who’ve done extremely well. So that is my example. And I’d be interested, Ross in particular, I think you’re sympathetic to some of those economic views, but my guess is that I’m further to the left than you are on them.

ross douthat

My strongest and most enduring form of conservatism is a kind of religious and cultural conservatism. And I sort of came into conservatism as it exists as a movement via that door where I was sort of a pro-life Catholic before I became any kind of political conservative. I may have made this joke before, but you know, you either become a conservative as a teenage male by reading too much Ayn Rand or by reading too much J.R.R. Tolkien. I was in the Tolkien camp. But that meant that I sort of came into a conservatism that in the late 1990s that had a lot of confidence sort of built up across the Reagan era and the end of the Cold War about its foreign policy and economic expertise. And in certain ways, part of my own education as a writer and someone who tries to think about American politics has been shaped by deciding that the mainstream conservative consensus was wrong on foreign policy during the Iraq War era and then turned out to be somewhat wrong, and here I agree with you, David, about economic policy after the Great Recession. And it was interesting because I started as a Times columnist in 2009. So the Obama presidency started. This huge debate starts, and sort of the default conservative position is, this is the late 1970s all over again. If we spend too much money or cut interest rates too much, we’re going to have galloping inflation. And I sort of deferred to that consensus for a while. And then through a combination of argument and evidence, decided that it was just getting the moment wrong. And so the columns that I look back in my time at The Times and I’m most likely to sort of disagree with or want to qualify today are columns about the deficit, the risks of the deficit, everything associated with that in the early Obama years.

david leonhardt

Michelle, have you had the experience, because obviously, in some ways, my recent move on this is typical of a lot of progressives. Have you had the experience of sort of looking at the center left moving somewhat more left on economics and saying, why did take them so long?

michelle goldberg

No, because I think that I was also part of that. For a long time, the people I trusted also suggested that excessive deficits are dangerous, and who was I don’t know any differently? I mean, looking back, I’m sure that I would have wanted Obama to push through a much bigger stimulus. But I think I got some of my bearings from center-left economists who have, in the ensuing years, move more towards the left.

david leonhardt

Well, what’s something else you’ve changed your mind about?

michelle goldberg

Well, looking back, I think for me, one of the biggest things is really Israel. You know, I grew up in sort of a standard liberal Zionist household. I remember my mom telling me when I was really young that Vanessa Redgrave was an anti-Semite because of something she’d said on behalf of the Palestinians. And although I didn’t necessarily take very much of what my parents told me about politics for granted, for some reason I sort of accepted this view that I’d kind of inherited on Israel for quite a while. And I also think I had a sort of reflexive disdain for a certain kind of anti-imperialist leftist, you know, the people who show up at the demonstrations with the keffiyehs and the signs talking about the great hero Saddam Hussein. And for a long time, I think I stupidly and reflexively lumped certain kinds of pro-Palestinian advocacy in with them. All of that was a sort of vague stew, I guess, in my mind until I went to Israel for the first time. And I remember really clearly, I think it was probably in 2004. And it was when they were building the wall. And you know, one of the problems with the wall is that it doesn’t follow ‘67 borders. It sort of cuts into Palestinian territory. And they’d built the wall through the village so as to cut one family off from everybody else. They basically put this family’s house in a sort of prison for no real security reason. It was just a reason of convenience for this thing they were constructing. And you know, the family was allowed in and out, but there had to be Israeli soldiers there to open the gate. And it was the most absurdist, twisted thing I had ever seen if somebody tried to describe to me exactly what I’m seeing, I would have dismissed them. And it also I think made me rethink a lot of what I’m now sort of embarrassed about is this reflexive disdain for certain kinds of marginalized left-wing foreign policy positions.

ross douthat

I mean, I think that idea about the moment when you realized the cranks are right, it’s sort of an important moment and you know, a dangerous one because sometimes the cranks are wrong. You know, I mean, we’ve been talking, I think my own examples and you guys are all sort of movements that are in some sense to the left, and so I should offer an example of ways in which my views have moved right. I did not fully expect the acceleration of liberal animus towards my own religious tradition that I think has been a feature of liberal politics in the years since Obergefell and same-sex marriage. We’re not sort of all the way to what I consider disastrous situations yet, but we’re recording this podcast just a few days after Beto O’Rourke got up at the Democrats’ L.G.B.T.Q. town hall and explained that actually tax exemptions for churches that don’t bless same sex marriages have to go, which is not the position of liberalism. But its expression by a mainstream Democratic candidate I would have dismissed as sort of a crankish, alarmist right-wing fear 10 or 12 years ago.

michelle goldberg

Do you still feel the same way about same-sex marriage, per se?

ross douthat

I think that the things that I expected to be cultural costs of same-sex marriage have been more significant than I anticipated. So I haven’t moved to the left on that issue, no.

david leonhardt

And by cultural costs, you mean what you feel is intolerance for religion or something else?

ross douthat

I think there is a combination of how conventional liberal attitudes towards sex and gender have changed since Obergefell. And a weird sort of sterility and sexlessness and the continued decline of marriage that are not caused by same-sex marriage but are connected to the broader change that made it possible. And I think those trends are worse over the last seven to 10 years than I would have anticipated in 2005.

david leonhardt

I mean, I don’t want to grope for some sort of false consensus here, but I would hope at least that you’ve taken some relief from the fact that while you’re right, Beto outlined this position that is pretty extreme, the predominant reaction on the left has been criticism and disdain for his position. And you’re right, at some point, that could change. He could be a leading indicator. But for now, I don’t see that happening.

ross douthat

I would say the reactions from the left were not sort of a outraged rejection but a sort of weary, well, you know, this is too extreme, and Beto is just trying to get attention. But I think the official consensus of reasonable liberalism has already shifted dramatically on the kind of pressure that should be applied to religious schools or Catholic hospitals. And when I have arguments with my own religious conservative friends, the things that I said 10 or 12 years ago to basically say, you know, you don’t need to panic about same sex marriage, the things that I said then don’t hold up now. So it’s hard for me to take that much comfort.

michelle goldberg

Religious conservatives constantly feel so beleaguered by the left. I mean, I understand that the left kind of has more cultural power. But at a time when the landing page of the State Department is Mike Pompeo’s speech about being a Christian leader and the attorney general of the United States is giving this Torquemada-like speech about the evils of secularism and the kind of destructive things that they’ve wrought, there’s these people who have this unbelievable amount of power, and they’ve got their foot on our necks while they’re screaming at us about how we keep oppressing them.

ross douthat

I don’t see the Trump era as sort of this effective restoration of religious conservatism. I see it as sort of a ineffective, compromised, corrupt, occasionally ridiculous holding action that is likely to be overwhelmed at some point in the near future. So it doesn’t give me some deep political comfort about the future of my own faith that religious conservatives have signed up for Donald Trump’s barricades, I guess, if that makes sense.

michelle goldberg

If there is a sort of growing liberal kind of contempt for a lot of conservative religious organizations, I think it’s intertwined with that because it’s sort of like, why are we supposed to give up our rights to take seriously your religious claims when you obviously don’t take them seriously yourself?

ross douthat

Yeah, I think there is an accelerative pattern where religious conservatives turned to Trump and anxiety and fear and then turning to Trump marginalizes them further and encourages their enemies to be more aggressive. So yeah, I agree, which is why, one reason among many, that I was not and I guess remain not a Trump supporter.

david leonhardt

Well, this is obviously a serious way to mark a birthday, particularly a first birthday. [LEONHARDT and DOUTHAT LAUGH]

ross douthat

Appropriate to the show, though.

david leonhardt

But it is consistent with the show. And I’ve actually really appreciated learning something about each of you. And we’ve along, the way, come up with the idea for about three or four additional segments down the road. So we want to encourage all of you to just go through the same exercise we just did. I read the phone number before. It’s 347-915-4324. Give us a call and tell us something that you have changed your mind about politically over the years. Now it is time for our weekly recommendation, when we make a suggestion meant to take your mind off of the news of the day. Michelle, It is your turn this week. What have you got for us?

michelle goldberg

O.K., so I actually feel a little bit awkward about making this recommendation in this conversation among three white people, but I am going to recommend that anybody who has the chance goes to see “Slave Play” while it’s on Broadway. It is this extraordinarily arresting, extraordinarily shocking and really brilliant play that starts with this absurdist premise of three interracial couples. And in each of them, the black partner has sort of lost the ability to feel and relate to their white partner. And so these therapists have created this bizarre and absurdist multi-day retreat in which they go to a plantation and sort of act out these S&M scenarios in what they call “antebellum sexual performance therapy.” It feels like something very new and very of the moment. And if you have a chance to go see it, you really should.

ross douthat

I think that’s a very powerful recommendation, Michelle. I haven’t seen it. I haven’t seen very many Broadway plays recently. But I think it’s interesting because I’ve been reading the coverage of this alongside the coverage of a play that people in my circles are really interested in called “Heroes of the Fourth Turning.”

michelle goldberg

Oh, I’ve heard about that, too.

ross douthat

Yeah, it’s basically just about this very conservative Catholic subculture and people within it reacting to and arguing about our moment. And it’s gotten sort of predictably positive coverage from religious writers, Catholic writers. But it’s also gotten very strong reviews, including in our own newspaper. And it’s interesting because we have these conversations, we did our cancel culture segment. We have a lot of conversations where we’re sort of talking about, is it possible to do interesting artistic work in a moment that is one, polarized, and two, features these sort of attempts to erect new taboos around political and cultural discussions. And the combination of the succès de scandale of “Slave Play” and the fact that you can have a successful play about weirdo conservative Catholics that gets a positive reaction from secular audiences. They both seem like potential counterarguments to the idea that everything is being shut down by polarization or political correctness.

david leonhardt

O.K., Michelle, what’s the recommendation?

michelle goldberg

It’s “Slave Play” on Broadway.

Good morning.

michael barbaro

alexander burns

I have faith in your crack team.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] I have faith too. It’s really the technology I’m beginning to question.

alexander burns

Hmm.

michael barbaro

Hmm. O.K., let’s do this. Alex, if you were going to summarize tonight in a sentence, what would it be?

alexander burns

I think this was the night where you really saw the moderate candidates on stage find their thirst for combat. And I think, interestingly, you saw that displayed not by folks like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar going after Joe Biden, the leading moderate candidate at this point in the race, but you saw it happen by them going after Elizabeth Warren to try to sort of prove their centrist credentials by challenging the left.

michael barbaro

Right. The front-runner who’s not actually quite the front-runner. I checked the polls right before the debate and by all accounts, statistically speaking, that is Joe Biden.

alexander burns

In an average of national polls, Joe Biden has a slight lead over Elizabeth Warren still in this race. But every other candidate in the race can read those trend lines just like we can. She is moving steadily up. He is moving steadily down. And the picture is even more pronounced in the early voting states, like Iowa and New Hampshire. So if you are a Pete Buttigieg or an Amy Klobuchar and you have staked your candidacy on a breakthrough in the Midwest, it is a bigger issue for you to get past Joe Biden and present yourself as a clear, compelling alternative to Elizabeth Warren than it is to go at Joe Biden directly.

michael barbaro

O.K., so let’s talk about how that actually played out.

The first question inevitably is about impeachment. This is the first debate since the impeachment inquiry began.

archived recording (anderson cooper) But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.

maggie haberman

And you had all 12 candidates in agreement —

archived recording (bernie sanders) I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment.

maggie haberman

— that they believe that Donald Trump should be impeached.

archived recording (joe biden) They would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.

maggie haberman

This is a big change from where things were within this Democratic field even a month ago.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment.

maggie haberman

And everybody was in unison. They didn’t all necessarily agree that he should be removed from office, but they did agree that he should be impeached.

archived recording (kamala harris) Our framers imagined this moment — a moment where we would have a corrupt president.

michael barbaro

Right. It seemed like every candidate used some version of the phrase “Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country.” It was almost verbatim.

archived recording (joe biden) This president is the most corrupt president in modern history — archived recording (bernie sanders) In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president — archived recording (tom steyer) — most corrupt president in the country. And that only the voice —

maggie haberman

And look, these candidates have generally tried to avoid having these debates be specifically just about Donald Trump. This was among the most Donald Trump-heavy first 10 minutes of a debate that I can recall.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the —

maggie haberman

But instead of using that moment as a way for any of them to sort of use a back door to criticize Joe Biden over the issue related to his son and the work his son had done in Ukraine while Biden was vice president, they all very pointedly, clearly, did not want to join President Trump’s attacks on Joe Biden.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

maggie haberman

None of them brought it up on their own as the debate went on. The rest of the night was really absent any issue related to Biden except for a question from the moderators.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. If it’s not O.K. for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it O.K. for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden? archived recording (joe biden) Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government.

michael barbaro

And everyone seemed quite ready to avoid it and just move on.

alexander burns

Right. And I think that that reflects a couple of things, right?

archived recording (anderson cooper) Senator Sanders, your response? archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me make a point. I think —

alexander burns

The moderators sort of teed up Bernie Sanders, if he wanted to go after Biden on the Hunter Ukraine issue.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured.

alexander burns

Bernie just totally did not take the bait, and neither did anybody else. And part of that is I think a sense among other Democrats that going at the Hunter issue, you really, really risk sort of triggering sympathy for Biden and looking like you are taking Trump’s side in a fight. And I think maybe as big or a bigger part of it is this calculation by a lot of the candidates on stage who want Joe Biden’s supporters to move over to their camp. That the way to do that is not by attacking Joe Biden and that you kind of got to trust that Biden is going to continue sinking in this race just by the force of gravity and his own limitations as a candidate and present yourself as a compelling alternative for people who are looking for a more moderate or a more conventional set of qualifications. And they do that by going after Elizabeth Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — after that. archived recording (marc lacey) Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for “Medicare for all.” You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?

maggie haberman

And you saw that right away with a question about Medicare for all, which she has been facing repeated questions about and people trying to pin her down.

michael barbaro

Right. There’s first an effort by our colleague, Marc Lacey, to twice pin her down on whether or not her Medicare for all plan would require a tax increase for middle-class voters. She doesn’t really answer the yes or no question.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not —

michael barbaro

Then Pete Buttigieg tries to get her to answer it and on and on. And she’s just kind of resolutely unwilling to say yes or no.

alexander burns

And it’s not even really sort of an ideological attack on her, right? You saw Pete Buttigieg pushing her just to sort of be straight on this question.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out —

alexander burns

It’s almost sort of a character attack as much as anything else. She loves talking about the mechanics of policy and where revenue will come from and where it will go and how regulations work and how it will change the way companies are structured. And the fact that this is the one place where she won’t say what we heard Bernie Sanders say —

archived recording (bernie sanders) Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone, all out-of-pocket expenses are gone. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up.

alexander burns

It would be a super sort of Warren-y answer, except she just doesn’t want to give it.

michael barbaro

And why exactly won’t she answer it, Maggie?

maggie haberman

Well, she won’t answer it because there’s not a great answer to the question. Usually when there is not a great answer to the question, you’ll see a politician do what she is doing, which is evade steadfastly.

archived recording (marc lacey) Senator — Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up? archived recording (elizabeth warren) So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hardworking middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind —

maggie haberman

The answer is most likely to be that there will be a tax hike, and that’s not an answer that she wants to be holding herself to right now. I also think that she’s probably leaving herself a little bit of room — emphasis on a little — for a general election on how she might answer this question of a pay-for for this plan. Her opponent, potentially, Donald Trump, is thrilled seeing her talk about this, because Trump and his advisers believe this is going to be an area where they can really push her and try to shove her closer toward the socialist label that he’s been trying to affix to most Democrats.

michael barbaro

And Alex, what did you think was the most notable exchange inside of this first round of efforts by the moderate Democrats on this stage to come after Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

Look, I thought it was the combination of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both speaking about Warren in terms of honesty.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is —

alexander burns

You heard Klobuchar, who has been so careful so far in this race to be very collegial with her Senate colleagues.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that. And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.

alexander burns

You heard her essentially describe Warren’s plans as a pipe dream.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done, and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers —

alexander burns

This is really harsh stuff, right? This is the kind of criticism that you have heard at other points in the race directed at Joe Biden.

maggie haberman

One thing, too, that I was struck by in Klobuchar’s answer is she more than once said that essentially, to Warren, your way of doing things is not the only way.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they’re different than Elizabeth’s doesn’t mean they’re bold. But we can’t —

michael barbaro

And does that reflect some kind of larger sentiment among these moderate candidates about Warren and about the way that she campaigns?

alexander burns

I think it reflects a resentment among some of the more moderate candidates of the way Warren argues sometimes explicitly, sometimes a little bit more subtly, that if you don’t approach policy the same way she does, it’s because you don’t have political guts. You don’t have grit. You’re not willing to fight —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) — fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we’ve — archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — got to stop —

alexander burns

For somebody like Amy Klobuchar, she sees how you get stuff done in government differently. She doesn’t think it makes her a coward. She thinks it sort of just reflects a different set of political values.

michael barbaro

So what’s the next notable exchange?

archived recording (marc lacey) Thank you, Congressman. archived recording (erin burnett) Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate.

alexander burns

You have this even messier multi-candidate pile-on around Warren’s proposal for a tax on huge private fortunes.

archived recording (erin burnett) Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.

alexander burns

That it sort of begins with this exchange involving Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, the only billionaire on stage, where —

archived recording (erin burnett) What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

alexander burns

— I think there’s an attempt by the moderators to try to draw out Steyer in a way that would maybe stir some tension on stage. And he basically says, look —

archived recording (tom steyer) Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor.

alexander burns

— wealth concentration is a problem. Then the spotlight moves back to some of those moderates we talked about before.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) This is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — to who sounded better on a debate stage — archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. archived recording (pete buttigieg) — debate stage or in a committee hearing — archived recording (erin burnett) Senator Klobuchar — Senator Klobuchar — archived recording (pete buttigieg) — versus what it’s actually going to take to get something done. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I want to give a reality che — archived recording (erin burnett) Will a wealth tax work? archived recording (amy klobuchar) It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.

alexander burns

You hear Amy Klobuchar not attacking the idea of a wealth tax — she says that she’s open to the idea — but again criticizing Warren for this sense that Warren thinks her ideas are the only good ideas.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that, after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.

alexander burns

Nobody is actually challenging the substance of her policy idea here. And in fact, you hear people across the ideological spectrum in the party either endorsing a wealth tax or at least indicating their openness to a wealth tax.

archived recording (beto o'rourke) I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.

alexander burns

So to me, this part is more of a primal scream of frustration towards Elizabeth Warren than a really concerted policy challenge.

michael barbaro

And when you say primal scream of frustration, I’m guessing you don’t just mean the fact that they think she talks about her ideas as if they are the best and the only good ideas, but perhaps because she’s just doing really well?

alexander burns

She is doing really well, right? That if you look back to where this race was when Beto O’Rourke got into it, right, back in the late winter or early spring, he was one of the leading candidates. Elizabeth Warren was at the back of the polls and struggling to sort of find two dimes to rub together for her campaign, right? Now she is one of the biggest fundraisers in the field. He is at the back of the pack, struggling to survive. And you do see — you saw it earlier in the race with Joe Biden. You see it now with Elizabeth Warren. People who are polling towards the back of the pack, trying to have some kind of impact in this race, go after the front-runner.

archived recording (erin burnett) Thank you, Senator Booker. archived recording (anderson cooper) We’ve got to take a quick break. We’ve got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio. We’ll be right back after this. [APPLAUSE]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording (anderson cooper) And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered —

michael barbaro

So as this debate went on, it felt like we saw the first substantive conversation on foreign policy that I can remember from these Democratic debates, in part, I think, because of the urgency of the situation that’s playing out in Syria. I wonder if it felt that way to both of you.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Vice President Biden, we —

maggie haberman

It didn’t feel that substantive to me, candidly. It felt urgent, and it felt emotional.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership.

maggie haberman

What I think was striking about it is that Joe Biden, who was vice president, seemed to really struggle in his answer to this question about what he would do and what he thought was necessary.

archived recording (joe biden) What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where — he’s going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real locked-down conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now. Pay that price.

maggie haberman

I think that Biden still sounded as if he wasn’t quite sure what to do. And I really thought going into this debate that this was going to be an issue that Biden was going to score lots of points on, because it’s right in his wheelhouse.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s one of the ways that Biden has tried to distinguish himself, by pointing to his experience and his gravitas, especially around matters like foreign policy and military conflict.

archived recording (joe biden) I think I may be — doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan.

alexander burns

Right. You heard him make that argument quite explicitly, that he’s the one person on stage who needs no on-the-job training, that he has dealt with Putin, he has dealt with Erdogan directly. What he struggles with, as Maggie was saying, is communicating that in a way that conveys a sense of command and reassurance to the people who are watching the debate. I did think there were at least the germs of a bigger ideological argument about foreign policy.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this —

alexander burns

You did hear a pretty stark difference between Biden, on the one hand, who, not in a terribly articulate way, talked about keeping American troops in Syria in some fashion, and Elizabeth Warren saying quite directly that she wants to get rid of those troops, just not in the way Donald Trump has gone about doing it.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to get — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no — archived recording (anderson cooper) Yeah. Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — military solution — archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor Buttigieg? archived recording (elizabeth warren) — in this region.

michael barbaro

And Alex, does that ideological breakdown, when it comes to how the United States should use military forces, does that fall along familiar domestic debate ideological fault lines? Or is it different?

alexander burns

It doesn’t map precisely onto the same fault lines as domestic policy, economic policy, health care. But I do think that the more populist wing of the party represented by Warren and Sanders and a couple other people intermittently onstage is much more skeptical of the idea of the United States being involved in foreign wars, of having permanent troop presence overseas. And it is something, Michael, as you obviously recall, that the president played to quite effectively in 2016, is this idea that there actua — there may be a consensus in Washington for the United States to play this kind of role in foreign countries, but in the rest of America, there’s a lot of exhaustion and a lot of skepticism. And that’s part of what I think was so challenging for Biden in this moment, right? That just talking about restoring the bipartisan foreign policy consensus isn’t necessarily super compelling to base primary voters, at least the ones who are voting on foreign policy.

archived recording (anderson cooper) As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution.

michael barbaro

So toward the end of the debate, the moderators asked this question that sort of seems to be pointed directly at this central tension that’s been playing out on stage.

archived recording (anderson cooper) Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump? archived recording (joe biden) Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people.

michael barbaro

I wonder what you make of the answers to that question.

alexander burns

Well, first, I think it’s really striking that the question needed to be asked in this specific way in order to draw Biden into conflict with Warren and Sanders. In past debates, he’s been so eager to go after them on a whole range of policies. In this debate, there were big sections of the night where he seemed to really fade from the foreground of this thing. And the moderators really sort of summon him to rise to this moment as a champion of the center in this race.

archived recording (joe biden) I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done.

alexander burns

He does it by describing himself as the only person on the stage who’s ever gotten big things done. He talks about the Violence Against Women Act. He talks about the Affordable Care Act. And he runs pretty quickly into quite a challenging confrontation with both Bernie Sanders and Warren.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington —

maggie haberman

What ended up happening was Warren starts talking about her accomplishments. She talks about what she did after the 2008 fiscal crisis. She talks about her time at the C.F.P.B. She talks about what she wants to do.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) If we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight — archived recording (anderson cooper) Thank you, Senator. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — for the things that touch people’s lives. archived recording (anderson cooper) Mayor — archived recording (joe biden) I agree —

maggie haberman

But you had Biden try to come back at Warren as she’s talking about what she did. He says, “I got you votes.”

archived recording (joe biden) I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight too.

maggie haberman

She sort of lets him finish. And there’s a pause, and you can see her almost drawing breath.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. And I am deeply —

maggie haberman

It’s a real dagger, because it’s a reminder that so much of what Joe Biden has done in this race has been talking about Obama’s record. Biden doesn’t handle that well —

archived recording (elizabeth warren) But understand — archived recording (joe biden) You did a hell of a job at your job. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Thank you. But understand this —

maggie haberman

— gets unhappy about it and pushes back that you did well in the role that you were in, meaning at the C.F.P.B. And there was just silence in the debate hall when he did it. It underscored what I think has been a theme for Biden in this race and certainly throughout the night when he was present onstage, which is it had this aura of don’t you understand that this is my turn, this is what I’m due? And it reminded me so much of what we would see with Hillary Clinton in 2016.

alexander burns

I think it was also just a total mismanagement by Biden of the dynamics of interacting with an emerging female front-runner in this race. That there was really no need, if you look at the record that he is standing on, for him to then try to sort of take a piece of her signature achievement, the creation of this new regulatory agency. And I think it was a reflection of her sort of lack of interest in escalating a fight with him, her sort of view that it didn’t make sense for her to sort of get into an extended fight with Joe Biden, that she didn’t come back at him harder on that front. It was a real role reversal from what we’ve seen in the race previously, where Joe Biden sort of goes from being the hunted to being the hunter as he sort of loses some traction at the top of this race.

archived recording (joe biden) And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who’s going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how are you going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade. archived recording (anderson cooper) Just to clarify —

michael barbaro

Alex, given the sensitive moment that Joe Biden is in right now with the president’s attacks on him and his son, is there an argument to be made that the best thing that could happen to Biden during this debate was kind of exactly what did happen? That he got to kind of hide away a little bit while all the moderates went after somebody else, Elizabeth Warren?

alexander burns

I think you can make the case that the best-case scenario for Biden at this point is to sort of protect the base that he has right now, hold steady, and trust the rest of the field to stay fractured. And if that’s the best case for him, then maybe that’s what he did tonight. I think it’s a really, really risky strategy, because it counts on everybody else being ineffective at appealing to the voters who are currently supporting you. So I think you could look at this as a low-risk debate for Biden, where he probably didn’t do damage to himself actively. I think you could also see it as a real missed opportunity for a guy who does have unmatched foreign policy credentials on that stage, who has been victimized by the president in a way that has launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump —

michael barbaro

Right.

alexander burns

— and who didn’t sort of wrap all that together and create a bigger moment for his campaign.

maggie haberman

I totally agree.

michael barbaro

Maggie, Alex, thank you. Good night, slash, good morning. We’ll talk soon.

michael schmidt

On Tuesday, George Kent, a senior State Department adviser on Ukraine, went up to Capitol Hill to testify in the impeachment proceedings. In Kent’s testimony, he says that the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told him not to worry about Ukraine policy. Obviously, a little weird for a State Department official who specializes in Ukraine policy.

michael barbaro

The message being, like, we’ve got Ukraine over here at the White House. You at the State Department, that’s not your issue anymore.

michael schmidt

Yet another odd way that the administration was handling its policy towards Ukraine. In the middle of this testimony, Giuliani himself puts out a letter that says that he is not going to comply with a subpoena from the House. The impeachment investigators want to talk to him. Giuliani says, nope, not coming. This is a sham, and he’s not going to participate.

michael barbaro

What else?

archived recording (amy robach) If your last name wasn’t Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma? archived recording (hunter biden) I don’t know. I don’t know. Probably not. I don’t think that there’s a lot of things that would have happened in my life that — if my last name wasn’t Biden.

michael schmidt

The other thing you need to know is that Joe Biden’s son Hunter gave an interview with ABC News this morning in which he took on the attacks that Trump has leveled at him about Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And Giuliani.

michael schmidt

Correct, and Giuliani. And he basically said, was it the best thing that I sat on the board of this energy company in Ukraine? Probably not. But he says that these allegations that Giuliani and Trump have thrown at him and thrown at his father about how his dad intervened to help the energy company, it’s all nonsense. There’s nothing to it.

archived recording (hunter biden) You know what? I’m a human. And you know what? Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based upon some un — ethical lapse? Absolutely not.

“It’s not lost on people that many of these candidates were actually on the record supporting impeachment before anyone was even talking about Ukraine,” said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and former Trump White House official.

The debate, held outside Columbus, Ohio, allowed Republicans to try to make their case in a state that Mr. Trump won by eight percentage points in 2016 and has many of the middle-class, blue-collar voters that he hopes to turn out again in next year’s election. To underscore the point, the Trump campaign took out a full-page ad in the Columbus Dispatch on Tuesday that blared, “Democrats Will Kill Ohio Jobs … President Trump’s Fighting for the Economy.”

The president remains historically unpopular, however. The Gallup presidential approval poll has measured public support for his job performance at below 50 percent for his entire presidency. To overcome this skepticism, Republicans have attempted to define the Democrats as out of touch and too far to the left of where most Americans’ views are. Some of the Democratic candidates, like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., hold moderate and liberal views, while Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont are generally more progressive.

Senator Marco Rubio of Florida on Wednesday expressed the kind of binary argument that Republicans hope prevails on voters. “Last night’s debate was a reminder that while you may not always agree with everything Trump says or does, the leading alternatives to Trump mock people with traditional beliefs & support socialism, gun confiscation & free government funded health care for unlawful immigrants,” he wrote on Twitter.

With Ms. Warren the target of sustained attacks from the other Democrats onstage, Mr. Trump and his Republican allies moved to frame the race around the question of whether voters want a strongly liberal president and government in 2021.

On Tuesday night, after Mr. Sanders picked up the support of two high-profile liberals in the House Democratic caucus — Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar — Republicans jumped at the chance to make them a focal point in the morning-after debate analysis. The two freshmen are a favorite target of conservatives, who have caricatured them as the true leaders of their party."

(If you don’t already get California Today by email, here’s the sign-up.)

On Tuesday night, 12 Democratic presidential candidates took the stage in Ohio for the biggest primary debate in history. My boss — Marc Lacey, The Times’s National editor — helped moderate, and my colleagues covered every minute of the three-hour show extensively. (They also made a quiz on the 2020 campaign so far, if you’re into that.)

Here are the biggest takeaways for those of us watching from the Golden State:

There were two Californians onstage, Senator Kamala Harris and the billionaire Tom Steyer, who lives in San Francisco. How did they do?

This was Mr. Steyer’s first time on a presidential debate stage, and he spent much of his seven minutes and 13 seconds of speaking time introducing himself and his ideas.

Yes, he acknowledged, he is a very rich guy. But as a longtime Democratic donor who has pushed for impeachment for years, he sought to position himself as the best person to expose what he described as the president’s failures.

And asked whether billionaires should be taxed out of existence, he answered yes without hesitation. He also railed against a government that he said has been bought by big corporations."
211,James Traub,So what can a Democratic president do to restore liberal norms? The resentment that Mr. Trump has exploited is plainly rooted in decades of middle-class stagnation and rising inequality. A left-of-center candidate like Elizabeth Warren would drain the toxins … [+2983 chars],America’s dual faith in individual liberty and democracy is under attack by the president’s populism.,2019-10-17,The New York Times,Can the Left Save Liberalism From Trump?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/opinion/liberalism-trump.html,"I start with James Madison, who was as committed as either Locke or Smith to the supremacy of individual liberty but was acutely aware of the inherent tension between liberty and democracy. Madison recognized that “the people” can be as tyrannical as a monarch. It is not enough, he wrote in Federalist 51, “to guard the society against the oppression of the rulers”; it is equally necessary “to guard one part of the society against the oppression of the other part.” What we now call a “liberal democracy” is a state where majoritarianism is tempered by a respect for individual rights as well as the rights of political or ethnic minorities.

The opposite of liberalism is not conservatism, as we understand the term in modern America, but populism. The illiberal populism of Donald Trump, Hungary’s Viktor Orban or Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, each of whom was more or less fairly elected, entails the cynical and reckless use of the mechanisms of democracy to disenfranchise political minorities, politicize the state, stigmatize immigrants and other “outsiders,” and diminish civil liberties. Populists address an exclusionary “us.” As Mr. Trump himself once put it with rare clarity, “The only important thing is the unification of the people — because the other people don’t mean anything.” Populism is democracy without liberalism.

We suffer from a confusion of terms, and not only in regard to liberalism. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are routinely referred to as “populists,” including in this newspaper, presumably because they assail the rich. But so did Theodore Roosevelt. In his day, as in ours, the rich vacuumed up almost all the value produced by the economy. Does pointing that out make you a populist? Does denying that claim, or endorsing the virtues of gross inequality, mean that you are not a populist? The thought is absurd. None of the Democratic candidates would talk about, or treat, “the people” as Mr. Trump has done. They are not populists. Are they liberals? Bernie Sanders — who calls himself a socialist, opposes free trade and shows very little regard for the working of the free market — is not. I have my doubts about Elizabeth Warren. But they’re not populists either.

Today, paradoxically, it is not liberals but conservatives who endanger liberalism. The secular, free-market conservatives who voted for Ronald Reagan accepted the basic apparatus of a liberal society. But Mr. Reagan also welcomed into the party extremists and conservative evangelicals who thought about politics in far more absolute terms. Over time, those groups took over the host body of the Republicans, leaving us with an illiberal party that represents half the country. Today’s Republican leaders, with the vehement support of their base, have threatened the autonomy of the federal and state judiciary, treated intelligence and law-enforcement agencies as instruments of the “deep state,” attacked the press and pulled down the empire of science, reason and fact into the mire of “fake news.”

It may be that a combination of the impending impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump and a Democratic victory in 2020 will break the illiberal fever. Certainly any imaginable Democratic victor would put an end to attacks on the government and the press. But it is not, in the end, the formal rules and institutions that sustain liberal democracy. It is the widespread faith in them, what we call “norms.” Forty years of swelling illiberalism on the right — and some reciprocal illiberalism on the left — have deeply corroded that faith."

At the same time, others like Ms. Gabbard, have been careful to endorse only the impeachment inquiry and not necessarily impeachment itself.

Below is a partial transcript of the exchange on impeachment at Tuesday night’s Democratic debate:

WARREN: Sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics. I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry. When I made the decision to run for president, I certainly didn’t think it was going to be about impeachment. But when the Mueller report came out, I read it, all 442 pages. And when I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown ... that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly. And so at that moment, I called for opening an impeachment inquiry. Now, that didn’t happen and look what happened as a result. Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke it again this fall.

You know, we took a constitutional oath, and that is that no one is above the law, and that includes the President of the United States. Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences. This is about Donald Trump. But understand, it’s about the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country. The impeachment must go forward.

ANDERSON COOPER: Thank you, Senator Warren. You’re all going to get in on this, by the way. Senator Sanders, do Democrats have any choice but to impeach? Please respond."

Mr. Biden’s treasury now ranks fifth in the Democratic field, also behind Senator Kamala Harris of California, who had $10.5 million in the bank, though her $911,000 in unpaid bills — to her pollster, media buyer and lawyers, among others — meant that her functional cash on hand was closer to $9.6 million. (Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg reported no debts.)

The self-funding billionaire Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July and reported spending $47 million , also has more financial resources than Mr. Biden heading toward the Iowa caucuses, which are less than four months away.

Mr. Biden’s team has steadfastly said that it has enough cash to run the campaign it wants, and recently announced plans to spend $6 million on digital and television ads in the coming months.

“The fundamental question about fund-raising is: Do you have what you need to run your race? And we do,” said Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden.

Watching without access to polling data, you might have imagined that this was some sort of wild careening mess of a primary race, when really it’s remarkably consolidated.

There is a Joe Biden constituency that seems stable at around 30 percent of the primary electorate. There is an Elizabeth Warren constituency that has expanded swiftly enough, especially in early states, to make her arguably the front-runner. There is a Bernie Sanders constituency that is about two-thirds the size of Warren’s and Biden’s peak and seemingly stuck there. And then, way down at around 5 percent and under, there is everybody else.

So a big question in this debate and in the ones before Iowa arrives and the also-rans begin to be formally run out is whether Democratic voters can be persuaded to reconsider this consolidation. And last night there were only really two candidates who presented themselves as plausible vehicles for that reconsideration: Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar.

As for the others — well, Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard are too niche, Beto O’Rourke is too limp, Julián Castro is too forgettable and Tom Steyer is too absurd. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker should be contenders, but Booker manages to be appealing at every debate without quite finding a rationale for his candidacy, while Harris has been on a weird self-destruct mission ever since her brief ascent — with her strange fight with Warren last night over whether Twitter should ban Donald Trump a particularly peculiar self-charted nose-dive."

Focusing only on taxes is pointless. But in a larger way, she’s wrong.

The No. 1 reason to question her version of Medicare for All — in which private health insurance would be eliminated — is its political viability. It would be an enormous disruption to the health care system, and history shows that health care disruptions are very hard to pass and usually unpopular at first. Polls show that her plan is already unpopular, and it would be a bigger disruption than Obamacare or Bill Clinton’s failed plan.

Given all that, she needs to engage with the political realities — with how she would overcome people’s resistance to giving up their health insurance for a larger new program that, yes, would require a tax increase.

I think Warren has run an excellent campaign on the whole, and I think she has the most thoughtful agenda for addressing the stagnating living standards of most Americans. I’m surprised that she has chosen to focus so much of her candidacy on the most aggressive version of Medicare for All. But she has. Now it’s time for her to tell voters how she will deal with the politics of passing it.

In my view, her best answer involves finding a way to signal her openness to a transition, in which people who want to keep their private insurance can do so (and taxes don’t yet need to rise) while Medicare initially expands voluntarily. That idea is hugely popular."

Eighty percent of white workers said their managers were white, while 38 percent of nonwhite workers had a manager of the same race. The results were based on a subset of 20,400 survey respondents from 81 of the nation’s largest retail and food service companies.

The researchers used a novel technique to find survey takers: They placed ads on Facebook. The full sample is of workers at 120 of the largest retail and food service companies in the United States, industries that employ one-fifth of American workers. It is not a random sample, but they said it is reflective of the retail and food service work force. It is much larger than any other survey of this group of workers and provides more fine-grained data. Social scientists not involved in the research said it was carefully done and convincing.

Two-thirds of workers said they received less than two weeks’ notice of their schedules, and 15 percent had less than 72 hours of notice. Eighty percent said they had little or no input into their schedules. A third said they wanted more hours than they were assigned.

Not knowing when they will work worsens the challenges of people living on a low income, the survey found.

Over all, hourly workers described going hungry, not being able to pay bills, scrambling to arrange child care, losing housing, losing sleep and feeling stressed and unhealthy. But those with unpredictable schedules were twice as likely to report hardships as those with stable schedules — even when they earned the same wages, worked the same number of hours and had the same employers.

After watching all the Democratic debates, I am left with the following sentiments that I believe are shared by many Democrats:

My heart is with Bernie Sanders because what he says about America and what needs to be done is absolutely true. My head is with Elizabeth Warren because she is Bernie lite, a progressive who is more electable than Bernie since she is less scary to suburban Republicans and independents. And my fear puts me with Uncle Joe, because he may be most likely to beat President Trump in the swing Rust Belt states, and the thought of four more years of Trumpism is unspeakable.

The big talking points from last night

Candidates were pressed on a number of issues at last night’s Democratic presidential debate. But the standout moments involved topics close to the business community.

On health care:

• Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has moved to the top of some polls, faced more criticism about her universal health care proposal than she has in the past.

• Mayor Pete Buttigieg told Ms. Warren he didn’t understand “why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans.”"

He rebuked Representative Tulsi Gabbard on foreign policy. And, most notably, he engaged in the most substantive and sustained contrast of any candidate yet with Ms. Warren.

It was Mr. Buttigieg’s exchange with Ms. Warren over “Medicare for all” that was most memorable, pressing her as she declined to say, yet again, whether her plan would require a middle-class tax increase. (She says her plan would curb middle-class “costs.”)

“A yes-or-no question that did not get a yes-or-no answer,” Mr. Buttigieg said, adding, “Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this.” He rattled off how her plan would “obliterate” the private health insurance of 150 million Americans while pitching his “Medicare for all who want it” alternative.

Mr. Buttigieg’s rebuke of Mr. O’Rourke — “I don’t need lessons from you on courage” — may lend itself more to a viral moment. But the bigger leap was to be seen as a foil to Ms. Warren.

Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage. What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

STEYER: First of all, let me say this. Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor. And the results are as shameful as Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income. It’s absolutely wrong. It’s absolutely undemocratic and unfair. I was one of the first people on this stage to propose a wealth tax. I would undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations. But there’s something else going on here that is absolutely shameful, and that’s the way the money gets split up in terms of earnings. As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor, people haven’t had a raise — 90 percent of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years.

If you took the minimum wage from 1980 and just adjusted it for inflation, you get 11 bucks. It’s seven and a quarter. If you included productivity gains of American workers, it would be over 20 bucks. There’s something wrong here. And that is that the corporations have bought our government. Our government has failed. That’s why I’m running for president. Because we’re not going to get any of the policies that everybody on this stage wants — health care, education, Green New Deal or a living wage — unless we break the power of these corporations.

BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Vice President Biden, you have warned against demonizing rich people. Do you believe that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren’s wealth tax plans do that?

BIDEN: No, look. Demonizing wealth — what I talked about is how you get things done. And the way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now. The idea — we have to start rewarding work, not just wealth. I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate of 39.5 percent. I would double it. Because guess what? Why in God’s name should someone who is clipping coupons in the stock market pay a lower tax rate than someone who in fact is, like I said — a schoolteacher and a firefighter? It’s ridiculous, and they pay a lower tax. Secondly, the idea that we, in fact, engage in this notion that there are — there’s $1.64 trillion in tax loopholes. You can’t justify at minimum $600 billion of that. We could eliminate it all. I could go into detail had I the time. Secondly — thirdly — what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the American people that we are going to raise taxes on the wealthy. We are going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not. This is one of the reasons why these debates are kind of crazy. Because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given. The fact is, everybody is right about the fact that the fourth industrial revolution is costing jobs. It is. The fact is also corporate greed, if they’re going back and not investing in their employees, they’re reinvesting in buying back their stock."

How many trillion???

Mr. Biden, deploying one of his favorite rhetorical weapons against Medicare for All, said Tuesday night that the plan would cost $30 trillion, or roughly 278 Jeff Bezoses, over the next 10 years. But Mr. Sanders has pointed out that that figure is much less than what the current system is projected to cost.

The truth is that no one knows for certain whether the country’s health care costs — which in total and per person far exceed those of any other industrialized country — would go up or down under Medicare for All. Ezekiel J. Emanuel and Victor R. Fuchs explain in The Times:

Medicare for All would move money from one column (private health insurance spending) to another (federal health spending); it does not automatically increase total costs. … We have our doubts about Medicare for All. But unaffordability is not a reason to oppose it.

“In some estimates, the country would not pay more for health care,” a Times analysis of five studies found. Rather, there would be “a drastic shift in who is doing the paying.” For that reason, it is more accurate to think of Mr. Sanders’s plan not as an outlay of (imaginary) money but as a redistribution of it away from insurers, drug companies, health care providers and higher-income people.

About those taxes …

Ms. Warren has drawn criticism for her continued unwillingness during debates to say whether Medicare for All would cause taxes to go up for middle-class families. Mr. Sanders admits they would, but Ms. Warren has refused the premise of the question, emphasizing the money most taxpayers would save overall after premiums (which come out of many people’s paychecks like taxes), deductibles, co-pays and coverage gaps are eliminated.

Middle-class people would “save a lot of money on health care,” the Kaiser Family Foundation’s Larry Levitt told NPR in July. Yet how exactly their net costs would change depends on the particulars of Medicare for All’s funding plans, which neither Mr. Sanders nor Ms. Warren has fully outlined. The Times wrote in a fact check:

Mr. Sanders has suggested various possible tax increases that could pay for this expansion, including a payroll tax that would affect workers across the economic spectrum. He has not provided enough details about the mix and magnitude of taxes for economists to measure what sorts of families would be better or worse off under Medicare for all.

Why not a public option?

Americans should be allowed to keep their private health insurance, Mr. Buttigieg has argued.

“The problem, Senator Sanders, with that damn bill that you wrote, and that Senator Warren backs is that it doesn’t trust the American people,” Mr. Buttigieg said during September’s debate. “I trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you, not my way or the highway.” He elaborated on his own health care plan, which he calls “Medicare for all who want it,” in an earlier debate:

You take something like Medicare, a flavor of that, you make it available on the exchanges, people can buy in. And then if people like us are right, that that will be not only a more inclusive plan, but a more efficient plan than any of the corporate answers out there, then it will be a very natural glide path to the single-payer environment.

Critics of public option proposals point out that the path may not actually be so glide-y. That’s because the price of health care services — not insurance or pharmaceutical profits — is the primary driver of America’s ballooning health care spending. Only a single-payer system can restrain those costs, Benjamin Studebaker and Nathan J. Robinson argue in the left-wing magazine Current Affairs, because it gives the government a monopoly on access to patients. “If instead there are a large number of insurance companies, providers can play those insurance companies off each other,” they write."

To answer this question, we must first ask: Which debate are you talking about?

Let’s do, to borrow a word from Andrew Yang’s lapel pin, the math. There were 12 candidates onstage Tuesday, any of whom could have had exchanges with one or more of the others. That made for (counts on fingers) a lot of different interpersonal dynamics. The debate was scheduled for three hours, yet — even with formal opening and closing statements dispensed with — it still ran long.

So there was room for a great number of debates within this debate, sponsored by CNN and The New York Times. This debate had many rooms. It had geologic ages. I believe that somewhere in there, they awarded the Oscar for Best Picture. It is said that near its beginning, the candidates argued about the merits of Medicare for All and how to pay for it, but those are only rumors; no written records remain from that time.

This ultramegasupersized format was the product of the decisions, first, to re-loosen the qualifications that had been tightened for the September debate, where only 10 made the stage, and second, to hold it all on one night, at “Lord of the Rings” length, with as many participants as there are signs of the zodiac.

But the most important news was Senator Elizabeth Warren’s determined refusal to say if her plans would require taxes to increase on the middle class.

Ms. Warren, the new leader in the polls, was given at least six chances to answer yes or no. She ducked every time. “Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it, yes or no?” asked one of the media questioners.

Ms. Warren replied: “So I have made clear what my principles are here, and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down.” She then talked about her “70,000 selfies” and town halls.

The reporter tried again: “Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for All. You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it, too?”

Ms. Warren: “So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.”

This resort to “costs” to avoid mentioning taxes was too much for South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, who chimed in: “Well, we heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer.” He added, accurately, that “no plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.”

Ms. Warren’s third verse was same as the first: “We can pay for this. I’ve laid out the basic principles. Costs are going to go up for the wealthy. They’re going to go up for big corporations. They will not go up for middle-class families. And I will not sign a bill into law that raises their costs, because costs are what people care about.”

Mr. Sanders, who wrote the Medicare for All bill that Ms. Warren has endorsed, then admitted what everyone except Ms. Warren admits, which is that taxes will rise for everybody: “At the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their health care bills. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up.”

The media questioner then followed up: “Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the Senator just said about taxes going up?”

Ms. Warren: “So my view on this, and what I have committed to, is costs will go down for hard-working, middle-class families.”

Next up was Senator Klobuchar, who said “at least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.”

The fifth time was not a charm as Ms. Warren again ducked the tax issue and spoke instead about Americans “going bankrupt over health-care costs.” Joe Biden then gave it a try, but you know Ms. Warren’s reply.

***

All of this illuminates a problem with Ms. Warren’s agenda and her political character. On Medicare for All, everyone agrees that the cost will be at least $32 trillion over 10 years. Ms. Warren could impose her wealth tax, her higher taxes on capital gains, her higher income taxes on the affluent, and she still wouldn’t come close to paying for Medicare for All. And that’s before her plans for new spending entitlements on child care, pre-K education, free college and so much more.

The only way to pay for this is to raise taxes on the middle class, which is where the real money is. That’s how government health care is financed in Europe, where the rich generally provide a smaller share of overall tax revenue than they do in the U.S. Democratic voters have to decide if they want a nominee who would eliminate private health insurance while dissembling about taxes.

Spinning fables is a habit for Ms. Warren. She spent years claiming to have Native American ancestry when it could help her career, only to apologize this year after the truth was exposed. More recently she said she left the workforce after having her first child because of sexism, which has been contradicted by official records and her own previous statements.

Democrats won’t be able to make the case against Mr. Trump’s falsehoods if their nominee is also dodging the truth. All of this argues for Democratic voters to take a deep breath and give other candidates a careful look."

“There’s fragmentation and a lack of transparency of information on what’s happening in real time and what’s going to happen,” Mr. Green said. “We’re connecting bread crumbs across data areas.”

Sergio Avedian, a senior contributor for The Rideshare Guy website and a driver coach, says the apps can help drivers, especially those new to the job, plan out their day, position themselves in the right places at the right time and wait for the most lucrative fares. “Drivers who just turn on Lyft or Uber and take whatever rides it sends are not making as much as they could,” Mr. Avedian said.

When a driver who uses both Uber and Lyft accepts a ride request, he or she will switch off the other service (ignoring or turning down ride requests can hurt a driver’s standing). Thanks to all that switching, their records of time and miles driven are fragmented. Services that stay on in the background all day can track miles driven and dollars earned per mile or per hour, for tax purposes and to analyze revenue.

Gridwise and other apps can also help give drivers a big-picture view. For example, knowing that a number of planes are landing and not that many drivers are at the airport could encourage more Uber and Lyft traffic."

At least a few other candidates who took an assertive approach Tuesday are in similar straits, straining to raise money or meet the debate threshold or both.

What could prove decisive in Iowa, and beyond, is if centrist voters coalesce behind a single candidate or fracture among the group of hopefuls presenting themselves as pragmatists. If Mr. Biden cannot recover a measure of momentum, but holds on to enough support to block other candidates from building a coalition of more moderate Democrats, it could allow Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders to roll through the earliest primaries and caucuses with relatively weak opposition.

This scenario, of a sort of zombie Biden candidacy, is what most alarms supporters of other center-left Democrats in the race.

Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, a close ally of Mr. Buttigieg, predicted the South Bend mayor would now “dig down deep in Iowa and New Hampshire,” carrying his message from the debate — a combination of uplifting rhetoric about the future and blunt criticism of certain progressive policies — into the early states where he’s polling in fourth place.

Ms. Whaley said she expected Mr. Buttigieg, 37, to make a determined effort to displace Mr. Biden as the candidate seen as most capable of speaking to Midwesterners."

A NBC/Wall Street Journal poll in July found that 72 percent of Democratic voters nationwide, largely liberals, said they would support a taxpayer-funded, single-payer health care system. Even moderate and conservative Democratic voters supported the idea, at 57 percent. Younger Democratic voters were particularly likely to back a single-payer system.

But support was mushier across party lines, according to the poll. Just 44 percent of all American voters supported a single-payer plan funded by taxes.

And when given a choice between Medicare for all and a public option, even Democrats remain split.

In a July study, Pew researchers found that 4 in 5 Democrats believed it was the government’s responsibility to ensure all Americans have health care. But in a follow-up question on how it should be administered, just 44 percent of all Democrats favored a Medicare for all model, while an additional 34 percent said they would like to see a public option operating alongside private insurers — the approach favored by Mr. Biden and more moderate Democrats.

Among the general population, just over a quarter of Americans said they would choose a Medicare for all-type system, according to the Pew survey.

Who’s Paying?

Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have made two claims central to their candidacies: that only Medicare for all would be enough to make health care affordable for every American, and that the richest Americans ought to pay far more in taxes than they currently do."

Fourth, there is a wave of insular intolerance coursing through parts of the American left. If given executive power, some progressives may use it to cancel any culture or faith other than their own.

And yet ….

And yet, if it comes to Trump vs. Warren in a general election, the only plausible choice is to support Warren. Over the past month Donald Trump has given us fresh reminders of the unique and exceptional ways he corrupts American life. You’re either part of removing that corruption or you are not. When your nation’s political system is in danger, staying home and not voting is not a responsible option.

Politics is downstream from morality and culture. Warren represents a policy wrong turn, in my view, but policies can be argued about and reversed. Trump represents a much more important and fundamental threat — to the norms, values, standards and soul of this country.

Last week, Trump all but greenlighted the ethnic cleansing of Kurds without an ounce of remorse. He normalizes dishonesty and valorizes cruelty. His letter to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reminds us yet again that we have a president whose professional competence is at kindergarten level. Once a nation has lost its heart, mind and soul, it is very hard to get these things back.

Furthermore, Trump is an unprecedented threat to democratic institutions. Over the past few years, I’ve thought the progressive fears of incipient American fascism were vastly overblown. But, especially over the past month, Trump has worked overtime to validate those fears and to raise the horrifying specter of what he’ll be like if he is given a second term and is vindicated , unhinged and unwell.

In their book “How Democracies Die,” Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt argue that authoritarians undermine democracy in several ways. They reject the democratic rules of the game, the unwritten norms we rely upon to make the political system work. They deny the legitimacy of their political opponents, using extreme language to deny them standing as co-citizens. They tolerate or even encourage violence, threatening to take legal action against critics in rival parties."

I’m David Leonhardt, and this is “The Argument.” This week, we talk about the new state of the Democratic presidential race.

ross douthat

It is very striking how quickly the Democratic field has consolidated.

david leonhardt

Then it’s “The Argument’s” first anniversary. Michelle, Ross, and I take a moment to reflect on how our own opinions have changed over the years.

michelle goldberg

Although I didn’t necessarily take very much of what my parents had told me about politics for granted, for some reason, I sort of accepted this view that I kind of inherited.

david leonhardt

And finally, a recommendation.

michelle goldberg

It feels like something very new and very of the moment. And if you have a chance to go see it, you really should.

david leonhardt

Twelve Democratic candidates took the debate stage on Tuesday, but much of the focus was on just one: Elizabeth Warren. She received the bulk of the criticism from other candidates. Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar each made the implicit case that Warren wasn’t a good candidate to win Midwestern swing states, and they specifically criticized her unwillingness to explain the details of her “Medicare for all” plan and whether it would require middle class tax increases.

pete buttigieg Your signature, senator, to have a plan for everything, except this. amy klobuchar The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done.

david leonhardt

Michelle, I think Ross and I both think this question of the tax increases is a legitimate question for her to answer, and I think you find it more frustrating. So let’s start there.

michelle goldberg

I’m extraordinarily irritated in both directions because I do think this hectoring on her to say I will raise taxes in order to pass this plan that will lower costs, to get her to say those words, I will raise taxes, is basically a demand that she give Republicans a talking point that they can use in advertising. I mean, they basically have made this a focus of every single Democratic debate so far and yet, the fact that she hasn’t figured out how to finesse it also terrifies me because it’s nevertheless going to keep on coming. And it’s obviously going to keep on coming in a general election. And she has to figure out a way to answer it without being evasive. And here, I think she might have sort of backed herself into a corner by embracing Bernie’s plan without coming out with a plan of her own, which I really hope she does soon because she ends up having to answer for a lot of details of a plan that she was never responsible for creating.

ross douthat

Yeah, I mean, I agree with you that the sort of moderator approach that we’ve seen for years and years and years of “Democrat, admit you’re going to raise taxes,” is this sort of performative toughness that I don’t think is actually that tough or that interesting. I think the problem here is that her plan has this massive real-world weakness, which is —

michelle goldberg

Well, she doesn’t have a plan yet, right?

david leonhardt

She doesn’t have a plan, but what she’s committed to has a massive real-world weakness, which is she has embraced this idea of taking private health insurance away from people and putting everyone in Medicare. And while focusing on just the tax part of that is too narrow, it is true that she hasn’t in any way answered the questions of how are you actually going to pass this unpopular plan that’s going to force people to give up their private health insurance and yes, force them to pay higher taxes, even if that’s not the most important part of it. Ross, this scares me, but do you disagree with anything I just said there?

ross douthat

No, I thought that Warren generally was fine on the debate stage last night. But I think her approach to what is on paper the biggest of all her big ideas, even if, as Michelle says, she doesn’t actually have the formal plan yet, it’s not really an effective approach. And it’s a particularly weird approach, given that she is standing right next to Bernie Sanders. And it’s made stranger by the fact that Warren is now arguably the frontrunner, and she’s the frontrunner on the basis of the claim, which is a powerful claim for a lot of Democrats, that you can do bigger things as a liberal and you should champion bigger programs as a liberal. But everyone in politics knows that if Elizabeth Warren is elected president, she’s not actually going to be passing a Medicare for all bill in her first term.

michelle goldberg

Sorry, can I just interrupt? Because I actually don’t think it’s true that she sees Medicare for all, or her campaign sees Medicare for all, as their biggest project or their biggest plan.

ross douthat

But that only makes it weirder.

michelle goldberg

I think that the thing that they are going to be focused on is probably going to be this wealth tax and all of these social programs, you know, universal pre-K and college debt forgiveness and the like that could be paid for by the wealth tax, right? That’s the plan. I don’t think that Democrats expect Medicare for all to be the first thing that a Warren administration tries to enact.

ross douthat

Right, but again, I guess to me that just makes it even weirder still, right? I mean, imagine, what would be a sort of Republican version of this, right? It would be a world where there were a couple of candidates on the right who were advocating social security privatization on the scale that Grover Norquist or someone like that has always wanted to see. And one of these campaigns was sort of all in for this and had this blueprint for how you would do it. And then another candidate would endorse that without having their own version of the plan but then say, oh, don’t worry guys, I’m technically running on this massively unpopular social security privatization, but really if I’m elected, I’m going to focus on normal Republican priorities like middle class tax cuts and tax cuts for businesses. I don’t know, it’s just a strange situation for the Warren campaign to have found itself in where if you’re embracing the Sanders’ plan, that’s a really big deal and a really big gamble. And you can’t just wave it away by saying, actually, we’re going to use a wealth tax to pay for universal pre-K, right?

michelle goldberg

Right, no. I mean, I think they’ve sort of allowed themselves to get trapped. And there’s other candidates on that stage that also backed Bernie’s plan. And you know, in a way, like one of the things that people who love Warren love about Warren is that she doesn’t say stuff that she doesn’t believe and she’s really earnest and forthright. But it’s too risky for something that they’re not actually even going to do.

david leonhardt

O.K., well we shouldn’t make the same mistake that the debates have been making and spend way too much time on Medicare, so we’ll spend only a little bit too much time on it. I’d be interested in what you both thought about Joe Biden. I mean, it’s true. Look, his polling just doesn’t fall. Ross, I know you keep emphasizing this, but it is really hard to look at him and not be anxious. I mean, that whole little riff he went on where at first he said he was going to get rid of the capital gains tax, and it’s fine, we all misspeak. Then he said, no, no, I’m going to double it. And then he said something about people clipping coupons in the stock market? I mean, are we too much in the Twitter bubble, and is there a world in which most Americans look at that and think it’s just fine and Biden actually wins the nomination and is going to be O.K.? Because I don’t really completely see it at this point.

ross douthat

I would be interested in a poll or a study showing what share of each candidate’s supporters are watching these debates because one of my guesses is that Biden support skews towards Democratic voters in constituencies who are least likely to sit down and block out three hours on a weekday night. There is a possibility that the things that all of us are seeing from Biden, people who are planning to vote for him just aren’t seeing it because they have better things to do with their life at the moment. Does that seem plausible to you guys?

michelle goldberg

Well, you know, it does, but I also don’t think that it’s correct to say that it’s just people in a Twitter bubble who are concerned about this. I mean, you see in Iowa where ordinary people are super attuned to what’s going on in politics and go and see candidates multiple times. You’ve seen his support in Iowa really go down, and now his campaign is basically conceding it and saying, they don’t expect to win Iowa, they don’t expect to win New Hampshire. So I do think the more people see Biden the more anxious they get about his ability to stand up to Trump.

ross douthat

I mean, to me, what’s striking, and I’m hardly the first person to write about this, but it is very striking how quickly the Democratic field has consolidated and the extent to which Biden’s place in the race has made it really hard for a whole range of candidates who seem like they could be electable candidates who are somewhat closer to the center than Warren and Sanders to get oxygen and attention and win votes. And you know, you could see both Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar trying to sort of pivot off Warren last night and presumably try to pick up some of those voters in Iowa who may be abandoning Biden. You know, there’s a window there where you could imagine Biden fades in Iowa as people pay close attention, and the non-Warren, non-Sanders vote coalesces around a Buttigieg or a Klobuchar, but it hasn’t happened yet. And if Warren wins Iowa, then it’s basically just Warren and Biden.

michelle goldberg

Well, I don’t know because I think my guess is that Warren will win Iowa, but then what if Mayor Pete ends up being in the top three, which I think is a completely plausible scenario?

ross douthat

Then he’s got the Lamar Alexander path to victory. [GOLDBERG LAUGHS] I mean, I think he needs to be in the top two. I joked about Lamar, but you really don’t want to be in the Marco Rubio lane of like, well, we’re going to come in third in Iowa and second in New Hampshire. [DOUTHAT and GOLDBERG LAUGH] Because Buttigieg is not going to win South Carolina, right? So I don’t know. David, what do you think?

david leonhardt

Well, I do think there’s one way in which third place is O.K. So the person we’ve talked the least about is Bernie Sanders, and I know a lot of Bernie’s supporters are extremely frustrated that he doesn’t get more attention. I just don’t see a path for him. I know he’s got about a fifth of the Democratic electorate who love him. I know he got more than that last time around because of the discomfort that people had with Hillary. But I do see a path in which Warren or Sanders wins Iowa, the other one finishes second, and Biden really fades. And I think if Buttigieg or Klobuchar can beat Biden, then I think they’re still in it. Because I think then you have a path to winning New Hampshire. And even if that candidate doesn’t win South Carolina, I do think there is a path in which a more moderate candidate comes out of Iowa as the top more moderate candidate.

ross douthat

Yeah, I guess that’s right. If Biden dropped to, like, fifth in Iowa, then you’re into sort of free-for-all territory in New Hampshire and anyone who finishes ahead of him could presumably have a chance. Then presumably, his support in South Carolina takes some kind of hit.

david leonhardt

Yeah. It’s really not clear. I just think there is a long slog, potentially, for a more moderate candidate and a more progressive candidate. And we all assume that’s Biden, and I think it’s overwhelmingly likely to be Biden, particularly when you think about the history. People weren’t that excited about Mondale, but he got the nomination. People weren’t that excited about Gore, but he beat Bill Bradley. People weren’t that excited about John Kerry, but he beat Howard Dean. I mean, there really is a very large pool of Democratic voters.

michelle goldberg

Right, but I feel like people are very attuned to that history. People see that. They were scarred by Hillary Clinton. They were scarred by John Kerry. So they might slouch towards the same kind of outcome. But I think that there’s a significant number of Democrats who see that exact dynamic and are determined to head it off.

ross douthat

And there’s also a media effect where, and you guys can tell me if you disagree, the center-left press, sort of accepting the pro-Bernie socialist wing, has decided that it’s Warren. They don’t want to sort of open it up for Klobuchar, Booker or whoever.

michelle goldberg

But who do you mean by the center-left press?

ross douthat

No, I’m talking about a mix of reporters and pundits at publications like ours and the CNN-New York Times-Washington Post world.

michelle goldberg

But you know, but that wasn’t necessarily true a few months ago. It’s not that her support is following the favorable feelings. It’s that people see that she’s drawing these enormous, enthusiastic crowds, that she’s able to survive all of these slings that Trump throws at her. And so the kind of favorable coverage follows the favorable performance.

ross douthat

Yeah, yeah. I’m not I’m not claiming that the media has rigged it for Warren. I think she’s run a strong campaign, and people are reacting to that. But I think, you know, there’s a feedback effect where that then becomes a built-in advantage for her. I also think the media is a little unfair to Sanders in the way that it treats him, vis-à-vis Warren.

david leonhardt

I mean, I guess Ross, I would say, I think, look, obviously, most journalists are left of center. But there’s also, I think, a bias in journalism toward compromise and toward bipartisanship. And I think we saw George W. Bush and Barack Obama in very different ways get positive coverage because of that bias toward compromise and bipartisanship. And so I actually think, to the extent that such a thing as a media establishment exists, it is uncomfortable with Warren’s more ideological approach and her more populist approach. But she is arguably the only candidate running a really good campaign. And if you’re going to add a second, it would be Bernie Sanders. And so we’re in this strange moment in which there are candidates who acknowledge the existence of swing voters and are trying to figure out ways to win them over and there are candidates running effective campaigns. And right now, the overlap between those two groups in the Democratic Party is zero, and that’s what worries me.

michelle goldberg

Wait, no, I don’t think that’s true because I think that there are certain sorts of Obama to Trump swing voters who are probably pretty receptive to a left-wing economic populist message that is kind of wholeheartedly against the billionaire class, against free trade deals. Those aren’t the people that she is laser targeting, but I do think that our conception in the media of who swing voters are, we tend to think more often of like Romney to Hillary voters. But there are a lot of people who didn’t vote for Romney because of that 47 percent crack who really hate corporate consolidation, who really hate a lot of the things that Elizabeth Warren is running foursquare against who I think, at least theoretically, could be open to her message.

david leonhardt

I totally agree that, Michelle. I just think that when you add on banning private health insurance, banning fracking, and decriminalizing the border that you’re starting to lose a bunch of those voters. I think Warren and Sanders are really good at appealing to those voters in the way that they’re deeply progressive on economic issues. I don’t think they’ve shown any instinct for tacking back to the center on anything. And on some issues, those voters are not way on the left. That’s all I’m saying.

ross douthat

I mean, I would only say, you know, I basically agree with David. But the polls that we have right now I think show both Bernie and Warren sort of performing equally to Biden. The Warren-Sanders case that they can win swing voters as well as Biden has not been disconfirmed by current general election polling.

david leonhardt

O.K., we will leave it there. A couple of weeks ago, we discussed the perils of airplane travel. I talked about my literal pet peeve, pets masquerading as service animals. Ross suggested that airlines make a family section so parents can sit together and help each other out. And Michelle took on manspreading.

michelle goldberg So they always take both armrests. They always spread their legs. I’ve taken photos of, like, my backpack is under the seat in front of me, and the man next to me has his foot on it.

david leonhardt

And by the way, Michelle, you actually e-mailed us a photo of that backpack after our taping as proof, which we appreciated.

michelle goldberg

Yeah, I have a chronic fear of kind of not being believed when I describe what it is like to be a woman in this world.

david leonhardt

Well, we got a lot of voicemails on this topic, so we’re going to go ahead and play a few now.

audience voicemail Hi, my name is Norbert. Hi, my name is Scott. I’m calling from Cincinnati. Hey, guys. This is Peter from Oak Park, Illinois. I enjoyed very much your comments, Michelle, regarding difficulties with male passengers on air flights. Men are not immune from the problems you have encountered. I know men are pretty awful generally, but Michelle was a bit off in only blaming us brutes. So now I wanted to volunteer to fly next to Michelle wherever she goes, and I promise I wouldn’t violate any of her airspace or otherwise. [GOLDBERG LAUGHS]

david leonhardt

So I guess that raises the question, have you ever, either of you, experienced this kind of aggressive physical space claiming from a woman on a flight, as one of our callers suggested?

michelle goldberg

So I definitely haven’t. And I think the thing I would emphasize is that it’s not because men are always larger, although men on average are larger. Because when I sit next to a very large woman, what she almost inevitably does is push her legs together, fold her elbows in, tries to make herself as small as possible.

ross douthat

But Michelle, oh my god, I have to tell you. I was on a flight, a long flight, last week. And the guy in the middle, who was already on the plane before me, I would say he was extended two inches into my seat already. Either I had to yield a large portion of my seat to this guy or essentially spend the entire flight with my elbow up against his. And I just felt like—

michelle goldberg

Welcome to my world.

ross douthat

Yeah, exactly.

michelle goldberg

I’m actually shocked, though. I mean, I totally did not think that that was something that men did to other men.

ross douthat

The male-on-male conflict over the armrest zone is sort of a chronic feature of long flights. Like, you know, I’m the alpha male. I put both my elbows and my middle seat armrest.

david leonhardt

O.K, well thanks to all of our listeners who called in on this topic. We love to hear from you. Leave us a voicemail at 347-915-4324 on airline etiquette or anything else. You can also email us at Argument@NYTimes.com. And we’ll be back after the break. This month marks “The Argument’s” first birthday. We started this show a year ago when the country felt as polarized as it had been in a very long time, and that certainly hasn’t changed since then. Impeachment is now in the news, and another presidential election is looming. But we created this show as a place where people from different parts of the political spectrum could hear each other out. Michelle, Ross, and I have certainly done a lot of hearing each other out in the last year, and now we’d like to take a minute to talk about how our own views have changed over the years as opinion columnists and just as people. I’m going to go first. I would say that over the course of roughly the 1990s, my views on economic policy, which is where I’ve spent the most of my time as a journalist working, moved to what might be called the political right, that I really came to see more of the importance of markets and how markets work, often in ways that other places don’t. I’m more positive about airline deregulation than a lot of people are. I’m more positive about school reform than a lot of people are. And then I would say that over the last decade or so, the 21st century, other parts of my economic views have moved to the left. Because when I look around and I see this crisis of net worth for the typical American family still being lower than it was at the start of the century, life expectancy falling, which I find shocking, the general views that people in the country think things are going wrong, I don’t think tweaks like a little minimum wage increase or an earned-income tax credit are enough to deal with what I think is a crisis in living standards. And so I am much more sympathetic to bigger tax increases on the wealthy who’ve done extremely well. So that is my example. And I’d be interested, Ross in particular, I think you’re sympathetic to some of those economic views, but my guess is that I’m further to the left than you are on them.

ross douthat

My strongest and most enduring form of conservatism is a kind of religious and cultural conservatism. And I sort of came into conservatism as it exists as a movement via that door where I was sort of a pro-life Catholic before I became any kind of political conservative. I may have made this joke before, but you know, you either become a conservative as a teenage male by reading too much Ayn Rand or by reading too much J.R.R. Tolkien. I was in the Tolkien camp. But that meant that I sort of came into a conservatism that in the late 1990s that had a lot of confidence sort of built up across the Reagan era and the end of the Cold War about its foreign policy and economic expertise. And in certain ways, part of my own education as a writer and someone who tries to think about American politics has been shaped by deciding that the mainstream conservative consensus was wrong on foreign policy during the Iraq War era and then turned out to be somewhat wrong, and here I agree with you, David, about economic policy after the Great Recession. And it was interesting because I started as a Times columnist in 2009. So the Obama presidency started. This huge debate starts, and sort of the default conservative position is, this is the late 1970s all over again. If we spend too much money or cut interest rates too much, we’re going to have galloping inflation. And I sort of deferred to that consensus for a while. And then through a combination of argument and evidence, decided that it was just getting the moment wrong. And so the columns that I look back in my time at The Times and I’m most likely to sort of disagree with or want to qualify today are columns about the deficit, the risks of the deficit, everything associated with that in the early Obama years.

david leonhardt

Michelle, have you had the experience, because obviously, in some ways, my recent move on this is typical of a lot of progressives. Have you had the experience of sort of looking at the center left moving somewhat more left on economics and saying, why did take them so long?

michelle goldberg

No, because I think that I was also part of that. For a long time, the people I trusted also suggested that excessive deficits are dangerous, and who was I don’t know any differently? I mean, looking back, I’m sure that I would have wanted Obama to push through a much bigger stimulus. But I think I got some of my bearings from center-left economists who have, in the ensuing years, move more towards the left.

david leonhardt

Well, what’s something else you’ve changed your mind about?

michelle goldberg

Well, looking back, I think for me, one of the biggest things is really Israel. You know, I grew up in sort of a standard liberal Zionist household. I remember my mom telling me when I was really young that Vanessa Redgrave was an anti-Semite because of something she’d said on behalf of the Palestinians. And although I didn’t necessarily take very much of what my parents told me about politics for granted, for some reason I sort of accepted this view that I’d kind of inherited on Israel for quite a while. And I also think I had a sort of reflexive disdain for a certain kind of anti-imperialist leftist, you know, the people who show up at the demonstrations with the keffiyehs and the signs talking about the great hero Saddam Hussein. And for a long time, I think I stupidly and reflexively lumped certain kinds of pro-Palestinian advocacy in with them. All of that was a sort of vague stew, I guess, in my mind until I went to Israel for the first time. And I remember really clearly, I think it was probably in 2004. And it was when they were building the wall. And you know, one of the problems with the wall is that it doesn’t follow ‘67 borders. It sort of cuts into Palestinian territory. And they’d built the wall through the village so as to cut one family off from everybody else. They basically put this family’s house in a sort of prison for no real security reason. It was just a reason of convenience for this thing they were constructing. And you know, the family was allowed in and out, but there had to be Israeli soldiers there to open the gate. And it was the most absurdist, twisted thing I had ever seen if somebody tried to describe to me exactly what I’m seeing, I would have dismissed them. And it also I think made me rethink a lot of what I’m now sort of embarrassed about is this reflexive disdain for certain kinds of marginalized left-wing foreign policy positions.

I mean, I think that idea about the moment when you realized the cranks are right, it’s sort of an important moment and you know, a dangerous one because sometimes the cranks are wrong. You know, I mean, we’ve been talking, I think my own examples and you guys are all sort of movements that are in some sense to the left, and so I should offer an example of ways in which my views have moved right. I did not fully expect the acceleration of liberal animus towards my own religious tradition that I think has been a feature of liberal politics in the years since Obergefell and same-sex marriage. We’re not sort of all the way to what I consider disastrous situations yet, but we’re recording this podcast just a few days after Beto O’Rourke got up at the Democrats’ L.G.B.T.Q. town hall and explained that actually tax exemptions for churches that don’t bless same sex marriages have to go, which is not the position of liberalism. But its expression by a mainstream Democratic candidate I would have dismissed as sort of a crankish, alarmist right-wing fear 10 or 12 years ago.

michelle goldberg

Do you still feel the same way about same-sex marriage, per se?

ross douthat

I think that the things that I expected to be cultural costs of same-sex marriage have been more significant than I anticipated. So I haven’t moved to the left on that issue, no.

david leonhardt

And by cultural costs, you mean what you feel is intolerance for religion or something else?

ross douthat

I think there is a combination of how conventional liberal attitudes towards sex and gender have changed since Obergefell. And a weird sort of sterility and sexlessness and the continued decline of marriage that are not caused by same-sex marriage but are connected to the broader change that made it possible. And I think those trends are worse over the last seven to 10 years than I would have anticipated in 2005.

david leonhardt

I mean, I don’t want to grope for some sort of false consensus here, but I would hope at least that you’ve taken some relief from the fact that while you’re right, Beto outlined this position that is pretty extreme, the predominant reaction on the left has been criticism and disdain for his position. And you’re right, at some point, that could change. He could be a leading indicator. But for now, I don’t see that happening.

ross douthat

I would say the reactions from the left were not sort of a outraged rejection but a sort of weary, well, you know, this is too extreme, and Beto is just trying to get attention. But I think the official consensus of reasonable liberalism has already shifted dramatically on the kind of pressure that should be applied to religious schools or Catholic hospitals. And when I have arguments with my own religious conservative friends, the things that I said 10 or 12 years ago to basically say, you know, you don’t need to panic about same sex marriage, the things that I said then don’t hold up now. So it’s hard for me to take that much comfort.

michelle goldberg

Religious conservatives constantly feel so beleaguered by the left. I mean, I understand that the left kind of has more cultural power. But at a time when the landing page of the State Department is Mike Pompeo’s speech about being a Christian leader and the attorney general of the United States is giving this Torquemada-like speech about the evils of secularism and the kind of destructive things that they’ve wrought, there’s these people who have this unbelievable amount of power, and they’ve got their foot on our necks while they’re screaming at us about how we keep oppressing them.

ross douthat

I don’t see the Trump era as sort of this effective restoration of religious conservatism. I see it as sort of a ineffective, compromised, corrupt, occasionally ridiculous holding action that is likely to be overwhelmed at some point in the near future. So it doesn’t give me some deep political comfort about the future of my own faith that religious conservatives have signed up for Donald Trump’s barricades, I guess, if that makes sense.

michelle goldberg

If there is a sort of growing liberal kind of contempt for a lot of conservative religious organizations, I think it’s intertwined with that because it’s sort of like, why are we supposed to give up our rights to take seriously your religious claims when you obviously don’t take them seriously yourself?

ross douthat

Yeah, I think there is an accelerative pattern where religious conservatives turned to Trump and anxiety and fear and then turning to Trump marginalizes them further and encourages their enemies to be more aggressive. So yeah, I agree, which is why, one reason among many, that I was not and I guess remain not a Trump supporter.

Well, this is obviously a serious way to mark a birthday, particularly a first birthday. [LEONHARDT and DOUTHAT LAUGH]

Appropriate to the show, though.

david leonhardt

But it is consistent with the show. And I’ve actually really appreciated learning something about each of you. And we’ve along, the way, come up with the idea for about three or four additional segments down the road. So we want to encourage all of you to just go through the same exercise we just did. I read the phone number before. It’s 347-915-4324. Give us a call and tell us something that you have changed your mind about politically over the years. Now it is time for our weekly recommendation, when we make a suggestion meant to take your mind off of the news of the day. Michelle, It is your turn this week. What have you got for us?

michelle goldberg

O.K., so I actually feel a little bit awkward about making this recommendation in this conversation among three white people, but I am going to recommend that anybody who has the chance goes to see “Slave Play” while it’s on Broadway. It is this extraordinarily arresting, extraordinarily shocking and really brilliant play that starts with this absurdist premise of three interracial couples. And in each of them, the black partner has sort of lost the ability to feel and relate to their white partner. And so these therapists have created this bizarre and absurdist multi-day retreat in which they go to a plantation and sort of act out these S&M scenarios in what they call “antebellum sexual performance therapy.” It feels like something very new and very of the moment. And if you have a chance to go see it, you really should.

ross douthat

I think that’s a very powerful recommendation, Michelle. I haven’t seen it. I haven’t seen very many Broadway plays recently. But I think it’s interesting because I’ve been reading the coverage of this alongside the coverage of a play that people in my circles are really interested in called “Heroes of the Fourth Turning.”

michelle goldberg

Oh, I’ve heard about that, too.

ross douthat

Yeah, it’s basically just about this very conservative Catholic subculture and people within it reacting to and arguing about our moment. And it’s gotten sort of predictably positive coverage from religious writers, Catholic writers. But it’s also gotten very strong reviews, including in our own newspaper. And it’s interesting because we have these conversations, we did our cancel culture segment. We have a lot of conversations where we’re sort of talking about, is it possible to do interesting artistic work in a moment that is one, polarized, and two, features these sort of attempts to erect new taboos around political and cultural discussions. And the combination of the succès de scandale of “Slave Play” and the fact that you can have a successful play about weirdo conservative Catholics that gets a positive reaction from secular audiences. They both seem like potential counterarguments to the idea that everything is being shut down by polarization or political correctness.

david leonhardt

O.K., Michelle, what’s the recommendation?

michelle goldberg

It’s “Slave Play” on Broadway.

243,James Traub,So what can a Democratic president do to restore liberal norms? The resentment that Mr. Trump has exploited is plainly rooted in decades of middle-class stagnation and rising inequality. A left-of-center candidate like Elizabeth Warren would drain the toxins … [+2983 chars],America’s dual faith in individual liberty and democracy is under attack by the president’s populism.,2019-10-17,The New York Times,Can the Left Save Liberalism From Trump?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/opinion/liberalism-trump.html,"I start with James Madison, who was as committed as either Locke or Smith to the supremacy of individual liberty but was acutely aware of the inherent tension between liberty and democracy. Madison recognized that “the people” can be as tyrannical as a monarch. It is not enough, he wrote in Federalist 51, “to guard the society against the oppression of the rulers”; it is equally necessary “to guard one part of the society against the oppression of the other part.” What we now call a “liberal democracy” is a state where majoritarianism is tempered by a respect for individual rights as well as the rights of political or ethnic minorities.

The opposite of liberalism is not conservatism, as we understand the term in modern America, but populism. The illiberal populism of Donald Trump, Hungary’s Viktor Orban or Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, each of whom was more or less fairly elected, entails the cynical and reckless use of the mechanisms of democracy to disenfranchise political minorities, politicize the state, stigmatize immigrants and other “outsiders,” and diminish civil liberties. Populists address an exclusionary “us.” As Mr. Trump himself once put it with rare clarity, “The only important thing is the unification of the people — because the other people don’t mean anything.” Populism is democracy without liberalism.

We suffer from a confusion of terms, and not only in regard to liberalism. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are routinely referred to as “populists,” including in this newspaper, presumably because they assail the rich. But so did Theodore Roosevelt. In his day, as in ours, the rich vacuumed up almost all the value produced by the economy. Does pointing that out make you a populist? Does denying that claim, or endorsing the virtues of gross inequality, mean that you are not a populist? The thought is absurd. None of the Democratic candidates would talk about, or treat, “the people” as Mr. Trump has done. They are not populists. Are they liberals? Bernie Sanders — who calls himself a socialist, opposes free trade and shows very little regard for the working of the free market — is not. I have my doubts about Elizabeth Warren. But they’re not populists either.

Today, paradoxically, it is not liberals but conservatives who endanger liberalism. The secular, free-market conservatives who voted for Ronald Reagan accepted the basic apparatus of a liberal society. But Mr. Reagan also welcomed into the party extremists and conservative evangelicals who thought about politics in far more absolute terms. Over time, those groups took over the host body of the Republicans, leaving us with an illiberal party that represents half the country. Today’s Republican leaders, with the vehement support of their base, have threatened the autonomy of the federal and state judiciary, treated intelligence and law-enforcement agencies as instruments of the “deep state,” attacked the press and pulled down the empire of science, reason and fact into the mire of “fake news.”

It may be that a combination of the impending impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump and a Democratic victory in 2020 will break the illiberal fever. Certainly any imaginable Democratic victor would put an end to attacks on the government and the press. But it is not, in the end, the formal rules and institutions that sustain liberal democracy. It is the widespread faith in them, what we call “norms.” Forty years of swelling illiberalism on the right — and some reciprocal illiberalism on the left — have deeply corroded that faith."

Speaking at a campaign rally hours after Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo brokered a cease-fire, Mr. Trump defended his decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, effectively clearing the way for a brutal Turkish assault on Kurdish fighters who had fought for years alongside the United States against the Islamic State.

The president’s decision to pull out drew rebukes from both Democrats and Republicans, who accused him of abandoning America’s friends. But Mr. Trump said the violence of the past week was useful. “It was unconventional what I did,” he acknowledged. “Sometimes you have to let them fight a little while. Sometimes you have to let them fight like two kids,” he added. “Then you pull them apart.”

While he has previously denied giving Turkey the green light to attack the Kurds, Mr. Trump implied on Thursday night that actually he had done so in order to persuade the two sides to come to terms. “Without a little tough love, they would never have made this deal,” he said."

As a young player, Zeile found the differences disorienting. In time, though, he grew fond of the Montreal’s art and architecture and came to view trips there almost as brief European excursions. But by 2003, when he played for the Expos, the team was splitting its home games with San Juan, Puerto Rico. The Expos ranked last in the N.L. in attendance in each of their final seven seasons, and Zeile said Olympic Stadium sounded hollow, like an echo chamber.

Now the Rays are the team that struggles to draw, and Zeile sees some merit to their idea of eventually splitting home games with Montreal, which M.L.B. has endorsed, at least in concept. But he said it would be hard for a team to win that way.

“It could be interesting from the perspective of trying to get the most out of a franchise that’s not getting full support in one home — but you don’t want to take the risk of having lack of support in two homes,” Zeile said.

“And there’s certainly going to be an opportunity cost when you consider that you’re going to feel like you’re on the road twice as much as you actually are. It’s hard to have two homes during the season and feel like you’re ever really coming home from a road trip.”

For Warren Cromartie, an Expos outfielder and first baseman from 1974 to ’83, the split-season option is more appealing. Cromartie is now the hitting coach for the Yomiuri Giants in Japan, but he has maintained close ties to Montreal, gathering an investment group to bring a team back to the city , which has staged popular spring training exhibitions and is targeting the Yankees for a visit next spring."

How many trillion???

Mr. Biden, deploying one of his favorite rhetorical weapons against Medicare for All, said Tuesday night that the plan would cost $30 trillion, or roughly 278 Jeff Bezoses, over the next 10 years. But Mr. Sanders has pointed out that that figure is much less than what the current system is projected to cost.

The truth is that no one knows for certain whether the country’s health care costs — which in total and per person far exceed those of any other industrialized country — would go up or down under Medicare for All. Ezekiel J. Emanuel and Victor R. Fuchs explain in The Times:

Medicare for All would move money from one column (private health insurance spending) to another (federal health spending); it does not automatically increase total costs. … We have our doubts about Medicare for All. But unaffordability is not a reason to oppose it.

“In some estimates, the country would not pay more for health care,” a Times analysis of five studies found. Rather, there would be “a drastic shift in who is doing the paying.” For that reason, it is more accurate to think of Mr. Sanders’s plan not as an outlay of (imaginary) money but as a redistribution of it away from insurers, drug companies, health care providers and higher-income people.

About those taxes …

Ms. Warren has drawn criticism for her continued unwillingness during debates to say whether Medicare for All would cause taxes to go up for middle-class families. Mr. Sanders admits they would, but Ms. Warren has refused the premise of the question, emphasizing the money most taxpayers would save overall after premiums (which come out of many people’s paychecks like taxes), deductibles, co-pays and coverage gaps are eliminated.

Middle-class people would “save a lot of money on health care,” the Kaiser Family Foundation’s Larry Levitt told NPR in July. Yet how exactly their net costs would change depends on the particulars of Medicare for All’s funding plans, which neither Mr. Sanders nor Ms. Warren has fully outlined. The Times wrote in a fact check:

Mr. Sanders has suggested various possible tax increases that could pay for this expansion, including a payroll tax that would affect workers across the economic spectrum. He has not provided enough details about the mix and magnitude of taxes for economists to measure what sorts of families would be better or worse off under Medicare for all.

Why not a public option?

Americans should be allowed to keep their private health insurance, Mr. Buttigieg has argued.

“The problem, Senator Sanders, with that damn bill that you wrote, and that Senator Warren backs is that it doesn’t trust the American people,” Mr. Buttigieg said during September’s debate. “I trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you, not my way or the highway.” He elaborated on his own health care plan, which he calls “Medicare for all who want it,” in an earlier debate:

You take something like Medicare, a flavor of that, you make it available on the exchanges, people can buy in. And then if people like us are right, that that will be not only a more inclusive plan, but a more efficient plan than any of the corporate answers out there, then it will be a very natural glide path to the single-payer environment.

Critics of public option proposals point out that the path may not actually be so glide-y. That’s because the price of health care services — not insurance or pharmaceutical profits — is the primary driver of America’s ballooning health care spending. Only a single-payer system can restrain those costs, Benjamin Studebaker and Nathan J. Robinson argue in the left-wing magazine Current Affairs, because it gives the government a monopoly on access to patients. “If instead there are a large number of insurance companies, providers can play those insurance companies off each other,” they write."

Enraptured by airplanes from childhood, Professor Hynes flew 78 combat missions over the Pacific. He once described flying as “a life, like a sex life, that no normal guy would give up if he didn’t absolutely have to.”

But the dozens of books he wrote, contributed to and edited were not all drenched in blood and guts . Among the more composed were his dissections of Thomas Hardy’s poetry, Edwardian novels and the work of W.H. Auden and his contemporaries.

Daniel Menaker, who studied under Professor Hynes at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, where he taught from 1949 to 1968, and who went on to become executive editor in chief of Random House, wrote of him in an email:

“Of the beginning of Yeats’s ‘Leda and the Swan’— ‘A sudden blow: the great wings beating still’ — he asked, ‘Where are we here?’ Those of us insecure males who may have hesitated about the seeming effeteness of this kind of study decided it might be O.K. if taught by a fighter pilot, up from poverty, who was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for ‘heroism or extraordinary achievement.’”

Sergio Avedian, a senior contributor for The Rideshare Guy website and a driver coach, says the apps can help drivers, especially those new to the job, plan out their day, position themselves in the right places at the right time and wait for the most lucrative fares. “Drivers who just turn on Lyft or Uber and take whatever rides it sends are not making as much as they could,” Mr. Avedian said.

When a driver who uses both Uber and Lyft accepts a ride request, he or she will switch off the other service (ignoring or turning down ride requests can hurt a driver’s standing). Thanks to all that switching, their records of time and miles driven are fragmented. Services that stay on in the background all day can track miles driven and dollars earned per mile or per hour, for tax purposes and to analyze revenue.

Gridwise and other apps can also help give drivers a big-picture view. For example, knowing that a number of planes are landing and not that many drivers are at the airport could encourage more Uber and Lyft traffic."

A NBC/Wall Street Journal poll in July found that 72 percent of Democratic voters nationwide, largely liberals, said they would support a taxpayer-funded, single-payer health care system. Even moderate and conservative Democratic voters supported the idea, at 57 percent. Younger Democratic voters were particularly likely to back a single-payer system.

But support was mushier across party lines, according to the poll. Just 44 percent of all American voters supported a single-payer plan funded by taxes.

And when given a choice between Medicare for all and a public option, even Democrats remain split.

In a July study, Pew researchers found that 4 in 5 Democrats believed it was the government’s responsibility to ensure all Americans have health care. But in a follow-up question on how it should be administered, just 44 percent of all Democrats favored a Medicare for all model, while an additional 34 percent said they would like to see a public option operating alongside private insurers — the approach favored by Mr. Biden and more moderate Democrats.

Among the general population, just over a quarter of Americans said they would choose a Medicare for all-type system, according to the Pew survey.

Who’s Paying?

Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have made two claims central to their candidacies: that only Medicare for all would be enough to make health care affordable for every American, and that the richest Americans ought to pay far more in taxes than they currently do."

“Send Quid Pro Joe Biden into retirement,” a narrator in the ad intoned.

The video wasn’t released by the Trump campaign, which has produced ads on Facebook with similar accusations in recent weeks. Instead, it was made by an independent political action committee, or super PAC. And it was allowed to run on Facebook with false information, in violation of the social network’s policies on misinformation, the Biden presidential campaign wrote in a letter to Facebook on Thursday.

In the letter, which was viewed by The New York Times, the Biden campaign acknowledged that Facebook had a policy of allowing all political leaders’ speech and ads to remain up because the company considers them to be newsworthy. But the ad by the super PAC was not from a politician, the Biden campaign wrote, so it needed to be rejected.

“This is a most basic test,” Greg Schultz, Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, said in the letter. “The ad contains transparently false allegations, prominently debunked by every major media outlet in the country over recent weeks. It should be rejected.”"

Continuing the fight with Facebook

In a speech on Thursday at Georgetown University, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, argued forcefully against the idea that the social network should be an arbiter of speech, doubling down on a stance that has drawn wide condemnation as the company continues to face accusations of amplifying disinformation.

Ms. Warren renewed that criticism after Mr. Zuckerberg’s speech, saying late Thursday in a tweet: “Facebook is actively helping Trump spread lies and misinformation. Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. They might do it again — and profit off of it.”

The comments continued an increasingly public feud between Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Warren. Earlier this month, Ms. Warren bought a political ad on Facebook that purposefully included the false claim that Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook backed Mr. Trump’s re-election — and essentially dared the social network to remove it. (Neither Mr. Zuckerberg nor Facebook has endorsed a candidate.)

Mr. Zuckerberg at one point invoked the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to make his point about free speech, which drew a response from one of Dr. King’s daughters, Bernice King. “I’d like to help Facebook better understand the challenges #MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians,” she wrote on Twitter. “These campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination.”"

Bernie Sanders drew the largest crowd of his campaign yet at a rally in New York City last weekend, at a moment when his candidacy may be at its most vulnerable.

archived recording (michael moore) The only heart attack we should be talking about is the one Wall Street is going to have when Bernie Sanders is president of the United States.

Those crowds are raising a fraught question for the leaders of the Democratic Party. Is the loyalty of Sanders’s supporters to the party or just to him?

jessica cheung Hi, I’m a producer at The New York Times, “The Daily.” Can I ask you guys a few questions? speaker 1 Totally. speaker 2 Yeah, totally. jessica cheung What brought you out here today? speaker 1 We love Bernie. speaker 2 I’m a huge Bernie fan. speaker 3 I’ve always supported Bernie, even before I could vote, so —

michael barbaro

Alex Burns, we’re going to do something a little bit different here. My colleague, “Daily” producer Jessica Cheung, went to this Bernie Sanders rally over the weekend in Queens, New York. And she recorded everything that she heard.

jessica cheung What’s the sign say? speaker It’s 2016, Bernie. jessica cheung It’s whited out.

michael barbaro

And it felt to her and it felt to us that she had really picked the right Bernie Sanders rally to attend, if you’re going to attend just one.

alexander burns

She really did. This came at a huge moment for the Sanders campaign. It was a huge test for the Sanders campaign.

archived recording (bernie sanders) We got a permit for 20,000 people, and we had to close the doors.

alexander burns

It has been a tough stretch for Bernie Sanders. He had a heart attack.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I am happy to report to you that I am more than ready.

alexander burns

He was off the trail for a couple of weeks ahead of this rally, with the exception of the debate in Ohio. Before the heart attack, the race was showing signs of becoming, really, a two-candidate contest between Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden. And Sanders was really struggling to show that he still had a path to win this thing — not just to be relevant, but to win this thing. And so these forces really converge in Queens.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Are you willing to fight for that person who you don’t even know as much as you’re willing to fight for yourself? [CHEERING]

alexander burns

And he delivers a speech that is in most respects not thematically groundbreaking. It’s about the big ideas of his campaign.

archived recording (bernie sanders) Today in America, half of our population is living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to pay their rents, their mortgages, their light bill, or fix their car.

alexander burns

Economic inequality, “Medicare for all,” corruption in Washington and on Wall Street. But he rolls out one of the biggest endorsements a progressive candidate can get, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and delivers his message with a force that is intended to really convey the idea that Bernie is back.

michael barbaro

In fact, I think he says —

archived recording (bernie sanders) To put it bluntly, I am back.

michael barbaro

— I’m back.

archived recording (CHANTING) Bernie’s back. Bernie’s back. Bernie’s back. Bernie’s back.

michael barbaro

Which is an acknowledgment, of course, that he needs a comeback.

alexander burns

Right, I think he has really resisted the idea that he has fallen behind in this race, but it’s manifestly clear that he has. And from his body language, from his rhetoric, from the way his campaign is now approaching the early states and big events like this one, it’s clear that they know he does need a comeback.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I am more than ready to assume the office of president of the United States. [CHEERING]

michael barbaro

And because his campaign is at this pivotal moment, we wanted to better understand his supporters and the nature of his support. What somebody who shows up at a Bernie Sanders rally thinks about Sanders, how they talk about him, and what that means for the Democratic primary. So that’s what Jessica ended up asking voters about, and so I want to play that for you.

jessica cheung What about him excites you? speaker 1 Bernie is the true progressive — the only true progressive — running in the race. speaker 2 Bernie doesn’t say, leave it to me. Bernie says, come with me. We must join forces to create the fundamental changes required in this society. speaker 3 If you look at Bernie’s record, Bernie has been just saying the same things since pretty much, like, the ‘60s or whenever he came into public office. jessica cheung The ‘80s. speaker 3 Yeah, sorry. jessica cheung It’s OK. speaker 3 The ‘80s, but the country moved around him. And so I think now, there’s a lot of people that are, like, jumping onto the bandwagon, and so I really just think it’s the strength of Bernie Sanders and his platform. speaker 4 He’s a prophet. He knows the way forward.

alexander burns

What you hear there is just the extraordinary stature that Sanders commands on the left. The real fruits of that campaign that he ran in 2015 and 2016, when he got out there into an ideological space that other Democrats were just not comfortable entering and ran an insurgent campaign against the party establishment in a way that most Democrats had really never seen before. So I think you rarely hear candidates referred to us as prophets, but even stopping short of that sort of quasi-religious language, the depth of commitment to Bernie Sanders among his supporters probably exceeds the bond that any other candidate in the race has with their voters.

michael barbaro

Greater even than Trump, or you mean greater even than anyone on the Democratic field?

alexander burns

On the Democratic side, I should say. It is probably closer to Trump than to any of the other Democrats.

michael barbaro

That’s fascinating. But I mean, at the end of the day, a vote is a vote no matter how enthusiastically someone casts it, right? So I wonder what this kind of next-level devotion means for his candidacy.

alexander burns

Well, it has meant that even in what was a very lean summer for him — just a challenging political time where he was being eclipsed by another candidate on the left, Elizabeth Warren — he has never really been at risk of being irrelevant in this race, of being truly sidelined, because right now, it looks like anywhere between 10 percent and 17 or 18 percent of the Democratic Party is very, very tightly bonded to Bernie Sanders.

michael barbaro

One out of five Democrats?

alexander burns

One out of five on a good day. Closer to one out of 10 on a bad day. But still, on his worst day, he’s got more support in the party than every other candidate in the race, except for Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. That’s a pretty good place to be. And his support is different from any other candidate in the race. It is particularly strong among young people. There’s the irony of the Bernie Sanders campaign — the guy who would be the oldest president ever, the oldest candidate in this race, his strongest age group is the youngest age group in the Democratic electorate. What it has also meant is that he has this incredible flow of cash into his campaign, almost irrespective of whatever else is happening in this race. He has a small donor online fundraising machine that has collected tens of millions of dollars for him every quarter that he has been in this race. And in the most recent quarter, he was the number one fundraiser in the Democratic field. That’s an extraordinary thing to say about a candidate who isn’t running a super PAC, isn’t holding conventional big donor events, and is running on Democratic socialism — that he’s the best-funded candidate in the race.

michael barbaro

Right. So his fundraising is outpacing his polling, which, correct me if I’m wrong, is quite unusual in politics.

alexander burns

Right. And you basically only see it when you have these candidates who have a limited but unbelievably passionate base of support.

michael barbaro

So it feels like Bernie Sanders is kind of a test case for why genuine enthusiasm matters so much in politics.

alexander burns

His supporters are willing to do things for him that other candidate’s supporters may not be. He is going to have an easier time staying financially competitive, mobilizing volunteers, and especially in some of these early voting, cold weather states in February, getting them to actually show up and caucus in Iowa in a blizzard, if necessary.

michael barbaro

They’ll do it.

alexander burns

They’ll do it.

michael barbaro

So the next thing that Jess asked voters about at this Sanders rally was this heart attack that Sanders had a couple of weeks ago.

jessica cheung This is its first rally since he just came back from a heart attack. I wonder if you think that that makes him less electable in any way? speaker 1 I don’t think age matters. I think that’s just stupid. Like, I don’t know why people care about that. speaker 2 No, because he came back stronger. And it was a routine procedure that many people go through. speaker 3 I know a lot of people that have had stents put in, and then felt better afterwards than before. And I think he looked great, so I’m going to stick with him. speaker 4 Well, the curious thing is that Bernie, having undergone this procedure, may feel, like, 110 percent better than he did before. Just the amount of literal blood flowing to his heart may give him a level of energy and stamina that he didn’t feel before he underwent the procedure. And he’s — speaker 5 I saw him play softball! speaker 6 I don’t think that our current president has the best health, so why are we worried so much about a heart attack that wasn’t a big deal? He went right back into it afterwards. speaker 7 Both George Bush Sr. and Clinton had the same operation done in their ‘60s, so — jessica cheung He’s also pushing 80, though. speaker 8 He is, but I mean, it doesn’t — I don’t — I’m not thinking about age. I’m thinking about — speaker 9 There’s a pretty heavy bias against Bernie Sanders because he’s a fairly unique candidate. Like, Joe Biden’s eye exploded while we were all watching a debate, and they didn’t single him out with a question like, hey, Joe, like, why did your eye explode? Like, is it going to happen again?

michael barbaro

Did I miss something? Did Joe Biden’s eye suffer some kind of explosion?

alexander burns

There was a CNN town hall where he had some kind of burst capillary in his eye or something like that. It was unsightly, but —

michael barbaro

Something did happen.

alexander burns

— not medically serious, yeah.

michael barbaro

So in summary, it feels like Sanders supporters in this crowd, they are not concerned about this heart attack. And I wonder what you think of the way it was discussed?

alexander burns

I think right after the heart attack happened, there was this moment of questioning, would Sanders persist in this race? Would his support collapse because people suddenly realize he’s almost 80 years old? Would his health become the defining issue of his candidacy? And at least for his supporters, the answer to all those things is no. They are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt on so much, and his physical health is not an exception to that. I think that you hear people giving rationalizations. It’s true that Bill Clinton had a similar operation. It was after he was the president of the United States. But the reality is a candidate having a heart attack is a really big deal. And historically, by any standard of political coverage, it is more than in bounds as a subject for scrutiny and for voters to consider. We’ve never had a president turn 80 in office before. We have two candidates in this race — two of the top three candidates in this race — would turn 80 in their first term as president if they were elected. People remember, I think, pretty well Hillary Clinton fainting at the 9/11 Memorial in the middle of the general election in 2016.

michael barbaro

I think she had pneumonia.

alexander burns

She had pneumonia. And you know, the Clinton campaign, I think, is still quite resentful of the way that was covered, but a candidate collapsing in the middle of a general election is a relevant subject for coverage. President Trump’s lack of transparency about his health has been a huge subject for coverage over the last few years. There’s enormous suspicion about whether we really know everything that we deserve to know about the president’s health. So this is not bias against Bernie Sanders, but the fact that people are inclined to see it as bias against Bernie Sanders, again, underscores the strength of his support.

michael barbaro

So you mentioned Hillary Clinton in 2016. Jessica encountered a lot of supporters who very much wanted to go back to that race and talk about what happened the last time around. And I want to play some of that.

speaker 1 We need to get Bernie elected this time around. The D.N.C. screwed him over in 2016. He was robbed of the nomination. So people want Bernie. speaker 2 I think it’s the race we needed to have in 2016. I think there’s a populist feel going on. The elites are destroying the country. And the Democrats lost because we ran an elitist. And now, it’s time to run a candidate with a multiracial working-class coalition. speaker 3 He knows that the Democrats are just as corrupt as Republicans, because there has been evidence that the D.N.C. did screw with caucuses — that in Seattle, he won by a landslide, but the delegates voted for Hillary anyway.

michael barbaro

So Alex, what do you make of that?

alexander burns

I think there are a lot of myths about the role of the D.N.C. in 2016, but the valid core to all of that is the sense among Sanders supporters — and this is really not up for debate — that the Democratic Party establishment did everything they could to give Hillary Clinton an advantage over him in that primary.

michael barbaro

Remind us of that, just so we can have it in hand.

alexander burns

You had everyone at the top of the party, including President Obama, do what they could to clear the field for Hillary Clinton. You had the leadership of the party in both houses of Congress try to clear the way for Hillary Clinton. You had other kinds of coordination between party officials who were supposed to be neutral, who were ostensibly neutral, and leaders of the Clinton campaign in ways that none of it was illegal and none of it was outside of the American political tradition, but if you’re a Bernie Sanders supporter, and you looked at that, and you felt like there ought to be an even playing field in this race, there wasn’t.

michael barbaro

I wonder how that makes a Bernie Sanders supporter relate to the Democratic Party and to everyone else in the field who identifies as a Democrat, especially if Sanders starts to falter.

alexander burns

This is one of the Trumpiest things about Bernie Sanders and his political movement — that in 2015, 2016, one of the best predictors of support for Donald Trump in the Republican primary was dislike for the Republican Party. He is obviously now come to embody the Republican Party, so that dynamic has changed, but you have a lot of people in the Democratic Party or on the left who are Democratic primary voters supporting Bernie Sanders and do not like the Democratic Party. It’s something that really frustrates more mainline Democrats — that they feel like Bernie is this interloper who is sort of rousing the left against the only party that really speaks to them. But if you are a Bernie Sanders supporter, you look at the traditional Democratic Party establishment as a collection of people and ideas that have failed.

[music]

michael barbaro

And what about the candidates?

alexander burns

Well, that is one of the great questions of this race — if Bernie is not the nominee, whether his core supporters will embrace another candidate with similar enthusiasm.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

jessica cheung One of the candidates, Elizabeth Warren, shares very similar policy positions. She’s also a liberal populist. I wonder what makes you continue your support for Bernie over Elizabeth Warren? speaker 1 Warren calls herself a capitalist, and she’s not out for a political revolution. I don’t know if I trust Warren. speaker 2 It’s hard to believe her when she still doesn’t have a Medicare for all policy on her website. speaker 3 It seems like now that she’s kind of just adopting a lot of the things that he was saying his whole life, pretty much. speaker 4 She is taking all of Bernie’s policies and kind of putting a spin on it. And it’s like, do you have any original ideas? And if she believed in these things, why wasn’t she supporting them four years ago? speaker 5 And you know, Warren used to be a Republican. speaker 6 Warren used to be a Republican. speaker 7 She was a Republican, and so, like, Elizabeth Warren, I feel like, is just a watered-down form of Bernie to try to make her more appealing, but the second the primary is over, she’s just going to pivot.

michael barbaro

Well?

alexander burns

Look, that’s really striking. She’s not been a Republican since I was in primary school, which was a while ago. But the fact that Sanders supporters have latched onto that in the way they have, I think, reflects just the gap in trust between how they feel about Bernie and how they feel about almost literally any other politician, certainly any other politician running for president.

michael barbaro

It still feels surprising to hear Sanders supporters attempt to differentiate a Democratic rival who, on paper, is so ideologically similar.

alexander burns

I think there are some important ideological distinctions, at least in the abstract. That I think in Elizabeth Warren’s ideal world, we would be a heavily regulated, heavily enforced, free-market economy — that it would be something similar to an F.D.R., Teddy Roosevelt kind regulatory regime. Bernie Sanders would, I think in his ideal world, have us much closer to a sort of Scandinavian social democracy, which is a really fundamentally different way of approaching government. And part of this is a dynamic that happens in primaries generally — that the candidates who are ideologically closest together can end up having the most sort of intense hostility between their supporters because they feel like only one of these people can emerge from this. And they’re right. But there is I think also a level of seeing the trees, but not the forest here, where you have the number two and number three candidates in this Democratic primary, if they were nominated, would be the most liberal nominee in, certainly, my lifetime and in lifetimes a good deal longer than mine as well. So the level of frustration does seem sort of out of proportion to what the downside of an Elizabeth Warren nomination would be.

michael barbaro

So Alex, to your point about the forest for the trees, Jess asked a lot of these voters, if Sanders doesn’t win, are you fine voting for anybody else in the party who becomes the nominee? And this is what people said.

jessica cheung And who is your second candidate of choice? speaker 1 Elizabeth Warren. speaker 2 If Bernie can’t make it, I’m happy with Elizabeth. speaker 3 If either Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders win the nomination, I would be so happy. And I think it would be, again, a sign of how much the Democratic Party is shifting. speaker 4 I do like Elizabeth Warren’s policies. And like, if Elizabeth Warren is the nominee, I’ll happily vote for her.

michael barbaro

So a lot of them, despite their skepticism of Warren, say, if I had to, I would vote for Elizabeth Warren. But then there were several voters who said that they would be very hard-pressed to turn out for anyone who wasn’t Bernie or what they consider to be kind of Bernie-lite, which is Warren.

speaker Sure, so I like Liz Warren. I think she’s probably the only other candidate I would ever even consider supporting. The rest of them, I find to be rather embarrassing. jessica cheung If it wasn’t Bernie, who’s your second candidate of choice? speaker If it wasn’t, I would probably vote for Elizabeth, if she was the candidate. I wouldn’t vote for Biden.

michael barbaro

That’s really interesting.

alexander burns

It really is. And I guess as they say in the Senate, I should revise and extend what I said about people sort of missing the forest — that you do hear people there sort of recognizing that the party as a whole has moved, that there are candidates besides Bernie, although clearly anyone else would be the second-best choice in this race for them. But I think what you heard is how hard it will be for a candidate who is not an economic populist to speak to this set of voters, that if you end up with a candidate who is an avowed centrist or a nominee who has repudiated what Bernie Sanders stands for — hasn’t just revised or watered down his views, but has rejected them and attacked them — that’s going to be a real challenge in the general election. I think one of the calculations the Democrats have traditionally made — certainly made in 2016 — is that the left will come home at the end of the day. And I think you saw in 2016, that was a risky bet to make.

michael barbaro

Right. I mean, that was a bet that just did not come true, because when Sanders supporters were asked to support Hillary Clinton, many of them did not. In fact, as we know from Times analysis, a meaningful number of them voted for Trump.

alexander burns

In the 2016 primary, it wasn’t just liberals who voted for Sanders in the Democratic primary. There were people who were just sort of disaffected and outside the system, people who wanted a populist, not necessarily somebody who is an ideological liberal as we traditionally think of it, people who just didn’t like Hillary Clinton. And then in the general election, there were people who were Democrats, who just weren’t enthusiastic. They would have turned out to vote for Bernie Sanders, would’ve volunteered for Bernie Sanders, would have donated to Bernie Sanders. And when you start to look at the margins of defeat for Hillary Clinton in the states that made the difference — Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania — could Democratic enthusiasm have turned out an additional 70,000 voters? Very possibly.

michael barbaro

So not to be too prescriptive, but based on everything you’re saying, if Joe Biden is the nominee, it will be a challenge, maybe a significant challenge, for this group of voters to be won over and transferred to him. If it is Elizabeth Warren, that will be more logical, although it will not necessarily be seamless.

alexander burns

I think that’s probably a safe bet. And if you’re Joe Biden, you know, maybe you can bring these people around, maybe you need to make up for a lack of enthusiasm on the left by winning over voters closer to the political middle, even folks on the center-right. That’s clearly a bet that candidates like Joe Biden are making — that if Bernie has his populist following that would be much more enthusiastic about him than about me, well, I have moderates who will never vote for a Democratic socialist, but who I can turn out in a general election. And in a lot of ways, this is the big strategic debate in the Democratic Party right now. We’ve talked a lot about the ideological and policy debates in the party, but sort of fundamental to the Democratic race right now is, are you better off trying to marshal a really enthusiastic and diverse coalition on the left or a more ideologically diverse coalition that is somewhat less reliant on liberal enthusiasm?

[music]

alexander burns

For whoever the nominee is in this election, and I think probably in most elections going forward, just given the ideological and demographic trajectory of the Democratic Party and the country, it’s going to be a recurring challenge for them. How do you harness what Bernie Sanders has created, while also appealing broadly to the voters that you need in order to capture the nomination, because Sanders is not actually doing that right now, and win a general election, which Sanders has never had the chance to try to do? And it’s a particularly important question when you look to the future of the Democratic Party. If you were to sort of make a bet right now about the trajectory of that party over the next few years, it will probably look more and more like the Bernie Sanders base and less and less like the coalition that defeated him in 2016 if the party stays on its current course. This is a group of voters that is very much here to stay. And the question is, do they stay as engaged and enthusiastic Democrats?

michael barbaro

Right, or do they basically start and finish their political journey with Bernie Sanders in a way that doesn’t really help the party?

alexander burns

Do they become passionate lifelong Democratic voters, volunteers, donors, or do they go back to being either casually engaged with politics, or disengaged entirely, or really sort of disgusted with the party as they were in 2016?

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (lindsey graham) O.K., I have introduced a resolution today with Senator McConnell. And the purpose of the resolution is to let the House know that the process you’re engaging in regarding the attempted impeachment of President Trump is a substantial deviation from what the House has done in the past.

michael barbaro

The Republican campaign to challenge the legitimacy of the House impeachment inquiry escalated on Thursday, as Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina introduced a resolution condemning it as unorthodox and improper. Graham focused on the closed-door hearings led by Representative Adam Schiff, despite the fact that Republicans themselves conducted closed-door testimony during the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998. And in his latest effort to break the deadlock over Brexit after yet another major delay, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would seek a new general election in December.

archived recording (boris johnson) We’re being very, very reasonable. We’re saying if you genuinely want more time, you can have it. Here it is. But the condition for that is that we all agree to go for a general election on December the 12th.

michael barbaro

Johnson hopes that such an election would give him a popular mandate to carry out his vision of a swift Brexit, despite deep resistance within Parliament, whose support is needed for such an election. In an interview with the BBC, Johnson defended the strategy, which his opponents in Parliament say is a form of political intimidation designed to scare them into supporting his plan.

archived recording But prime minister, it’s not standard behavior. You’re essentially trying to blackmail Parliament with the threat of an election in order to ram through your bill. You could just say, fine, let’s have as long as it takes to get through this line by line in Parliament. Would that not be the responsible thing to do? archived recording (boris johnson) Now, come on. We’ve had three and a half years of this. archived recording Not looking at this bill.

Mr. Trumps trip … [+2055 chars]","Hours after his vice president and secretary of state brokered a cease-fire, President Trump said he was right to let Turkey attack America’s Kurdish allies because it eventually led to a deal.",2019-10-18,The New York Times,Trump Compares Turks and Kurds to ‘Two Kids’ Fighting,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/us/politics/trump-rally-dallas.html,"DALLAS — President Trump insisted on Thursday night that he was smart to let Turkey attack America’s Kurdish allies in northern Syria, comparing the two warring sides to children on a playground who need to slug it out before settling their differences.

Speaking at a campaign rally hours after Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo brokered a cease-fire, Mr. Trump defended his decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, effectively clearing the way for a brutal Turkish assault on Kurdish fighters who had fought for years alongside the United States against the Islamic State.

The president’s decision to pull out drew rebukes from both Democrats and Republicans, who accused him of abandoning America’s friends. But Mr. Trump said the violence of the past week was useful. “It was unconventional what I did,” he acknowledged. “Sometimes you have to let them fight a little while. Sometimes you have to let them fight like two kids,” he added. “Then you pull them apart.”

While he has previously denied giving Turkey the green light to attack the Kurds, Mr. Trump implied on Thursday night that actually he had done so in order to persuade the two sides to come to terms. “Without a little tough love, they would never have made this deal,” he said."

As a young player, Zeile found the differences disorienting. In time, though, he grew fond of the Montreal’s art and architecture and came to view trips there almost as brief European excursions. But by 2003, when he played for the Expos, the team was splitting its home games with San Juan, Puerto Rico. The Expos ranked last in the N.L. in attendance in each of their final seven seasons, and Zeile said Olympic Stadium sounded hollow, like an echo chamber.

Now the Rays are the team that struggles to draw, and Zeile sees some merit to their idea of eventually splitting home games with Montreal, which M.L.B. has endorsed, at least in concept. But he said it would be hard for a team to win that way.

“It could be interesting from the perspective of trying to get the most out of a franchise that’s not getting full support in one home — but you don’t want to take the risk of having lack of support in two homes,” Zeile said.

“And there’s certainly going to be an opportunity cost when you consider that you’re going to feel like you’re on the road twice as much as you actually are. It’s hard to have two homes during the season and feel like you’re ever really coming home from a road trip.”

For Warren Cromartie, an Expos outfielder and first baseman from 1974 to ’83, the split-season option is more appealing. Cromartie is now the hitting coach for the Yomiuri Giants in Japan, but he has maintained close ties to Montreal, gathering an investment group to bring a team back to the city , which has staged popular spring training exhibitions and is targeting the Yankees for a visit next spring."

Facebook’s chief doubles down on free speech

Mark Zuckerberg pushed back against his critics yesterday and defended the social network’s policy of not policing political speech, Cecilia Kang and Mike Isaac of the NYT report.

Mr. Zuckerberg said that “Facebook had been founded to give people a voice and bring them together, and that critics who had assailed the company for doing so were setting a dangerous example,” Ms. Kang and Mr. Isaac write.

“People having the power to express themselves at scale is a new kind of force in the world — a Fifth Estate alongside the other power structures of society,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in his 35-minute speech at Georgetown University, in which he invoked Frederick Douglass, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the Vietnam War and the First Amendment."

Each set of initials scratched on foreign monuments, each photograph or amateurish memoir, Professor Hynes wrote , was like those three words — some G.I.’s impulsive pursuit of immortality in the face of death. “He was placing himself in history, “ he wrote, “recording that once in his life he had been present where great public events were happening.”

Image “I was a true believer in the religion of flight,” Professor Hynes wrote in “Flights of Passage.” Credit... Penguin Random House

Enraptured by airplanes from childhood, Professor Hynes flew 78 combat missions over the Pacific. He once described flying as “a life, like a sex life, that no normal guy would give up if he didn’t absolutely have to.”

But the dozens of books he wrote, contributed to and edited were not all drenched in blood and guts . Among the more composed were his dissections of Thomas Hardy’s poetry, Edwardian novels and the work of W.H. Auden and his contemporaries.

Daniel Menaker, who studied under Professor Hynes at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, where he taught from 1949 to 1968, and who went on to become executive editor in chief of Random House, wrote of him in an email:

“Of the beginning of Yeats’s ‘Leda and the Swan’— ‘A sudden blow: the great wings beating still’ — he asked, ‘Where are we here?’ Those of us insecure males who may have hesitated about the seeming effeteness of this kind of study decided it might be O.K. if taught by a fighter pilot, up from poverty, who was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for ‘heroism or extraordinary achievement.’”

Ms. Warren has become known for her towering stack of policy plans, having offered dozens of proposals on a wide variety of subjects. But on health care, she has not been similarly forthcoming, and her repeated refusal to say whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to help finance Medicare for all has drawn sharp criticism from some of her Democratic presidential rivals.

Given her increasing status as a front-runner in the primary race, Ms. Warren was ce rtain to continue facing challenges on the issue. For weeks, she has sidestepped questions about raising taxes, no matter who was asking and when. But it had been an open question whether it would remain politically tenable for her to continue simply aligning herself with Senator Bernie Sanders’s health care plan while declining to provide any detailed explanation of how she would pay for it.

Ms. Warren brought up the issue of Medicare for all at the end of a town-hall-style event in Iowa on Sunday afternoon. “I plan over the next few weeks to put out a plan that talks about, specifically, the cost of Medicare for all and, specifically, how we pay for it,” she told the crowd at the event, held at Simpson College."

The video wasn’t released by the Trump campaign, which has produced ads on Facebook with similar accusations in recent weeks. Instead, it was made by an independent political action committee, or super PAC. And it was allowed to run on Facebook with false information, in violation of the social network’s policies on misinformation, the Biden presidential campaign wrote in a letter to Facebook on Thursday.

In the letter, which was viewed by The New York Times, the Biden campaign acknowledged that Facebook had a policy of allowing all political leaders’ speech and ads to remain up because the company considers them to be newsworthy. But the ad by the super PAC was not from a politician, the Biden campaign wrote, so it needed to be rejected.

Continuing the fight with Facebook

In a speech on Thursday at Georgetown University, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, argued forcefully against the idea that the social network should be an arbiter of speech, doubling down on a stance that has drawn wide condemnation as the company continues to face accusations of amplifying disinformation.

Ms. Warren renewed that criticism after Mr. Zuckerberg’s speech, saying late Thursday in a tweet: “Facebook is actively helping Trump spread lies and misinformation. Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. They might do it again — and profit off of it.”

The comments continued an increasingly public feud between Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Warren. Earlier this month, Ms. Warren bought a political ad on Facebook that purposefully included the false claim that Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook backed Mr. Trump’s re-election — and essentially dared the social network to remove it. (Neither Mr. Zuckerberg nor Facebook has endorsed a candidate.)

Mr. Zuckerberg at one point invoked the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to make his point about free speech, which drew a response from one of Dr. King’s daughters, Bernice King. “I’d like to help Facebook better understand the challenges #MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians,” she wrote on Twitter. “These campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination.”"

michael barbaro

Alex Burns, we’re going to do something a little bit different here. My colleague, “Daily” producer Jessica Cheung, went to this Bernie Sanders rally over the weekend in Queens, New York. And she recorded everything that she heard.

jessica cheung What’s the sign say? speaker It’s 2016, Bernie. jessica cheung It’s whited out.

michael barbaro

And it felt to her and it felt to us that she had really picked the right Bernie Sanders rally to attend, if you’re going to attend just one.

alexander burns

She really did. This came at a huge moment for the Sanders campaign. It was a huge test for the Sanders campaign.

archived recording (bernie sanders) We got a permit for 20,000 people, and we had to close the doors.

alexander burns

It has been a tough stretch for Bernie Sanders. He had a heart attack.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I am happy to report to you that I am more than ready.

alexander burns

He was off the trail for a couple of weeks ahead of this rally, with the exception of the debate in Ohio. Before the heart attack, the race was showing signs of becoming, really, a two-candidate contest between Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden. And Sanders was really struggling to show that he still had a path to win this thing — not just to be relevant, but to win this thing. And so these forces really converge in Queens.

And he delivers a speech that is in most respects not thematically groundbreaking. It’s about the big ideas of his campaign.

Which is an acknowledgment, of course, that he needs a comeback.

alexander burns

Right, I think he has really resisted the idea that he has fallen behind in this race, but it’s manifestly clear that he has. And from his body language, from his rhetoric, from the way his campaign is now approaching the early states and big events like this one, it’s clear that they know he does need a comeback.

archived recording (bernie sanders) I am more than ready to assume the office of president of the United States. [CHEERING]

michael barbaro

And because his campaign is at this pivotal moment, we wanted to better understand his supporters and the nature of his support. What somebody who shows up at a Bernie Sanders rally thinks about Sanders, how they talk about him, and what that means for the Democratic primary. So that’s what Jessica ended up asking voters about, and so I want to play that for you.

jessica cheung What about him excites you? speaker 1 Bernie is the true progressive — the only true progressive — running in the race. speaker 2 Bernie doesn’t say, leave it to me. Bernie says, come with me. We must join forces to create the fundamental changes required in this society. speaker 3 If you look at Bernie’s record, Bernie has been just saying the same things since pretty much, like, the ‘60s or whenever he came into public office. jessica cheung The ‘80s. speaker 3 Yeah, sorry. jessica cheung It’s OK. speaker 3 The ‘80s, but the country moved around him. And so I think now, there’s a lot of people that are, like, jumping onto the bandwagon, and so I really just think it’s the strength of Bernie Sanders and his platform. speaker 4 He’s a prophet. He knows the way forward.

alexander burns

What you hear there is just the extraordinary stature that Sanders commands on the left. The real fruits of that campaign that he ran in 2015 and 2016, when he got out there into an ideological space that other Democrats were just not comfortable entering and ran an insurgent campaign against the party establishment in a way that most Democrats had really never seen before. So I think you rarely hear candidates referred to us as prophets, but even stopping short of that sort of quasi-religious language, the depth of commitment to Bernie Sanders among his supporters probably exceeds the bond that any other candidate in the race has with their voters.

michael barbaro

Greater even than Trump, or you mean greater even than anyone on the Democratic field?

alexander burns

On the Democratic side, I should say. It is probably closer to Trump than to any of the other Democrats.

michael barbaro

That’s fascinating. But I mean, at the end of the day, a vote is a vote no matter how enthusiastically someone casts it, right? So I wonder what this kind of next-level devotion means for his candidacy.

alexander burns

Well, it has meant that even in what was a very lean summer for him — just a challenging political time where he was being eclipsed by another candidate on the left, Elizabeth Warren — he has never really been at risk of being irrelevant in this race, of being truly sidelined, because right now, it looks like anywhere between 10 percent and 17 or 18 percent of the Democratic Party is very, very tightly bonded to Bernie Sanders.

michael barbaro

One out of five Democrats?

alexander burns

One out of five on a good day. Closer to one out of 10 on a bad day. But still, on his worst day, he’s got more support in the party than every other candidate in the race, except for Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. That’s a pretty good place to be. And his support is different from any other candidate in the race. It is particularly strong among young people. There’s the irony of the Bernie Sanders campaign — the guy who would be the oldest president ever, the oldest candidate in this race, his strongest age group is the youngest age group in the Democratic electorate. What it has also meant is that he has this incredible flow of cash into his campaign, almost irrespective of whatever else is happening in this race. He has a small donor online fundraising machine that has collected tens of millions of dollars for him every quarter that he has been in this race. And in the most recent quarter, he was the number one fundraiser in the Democratic field. That’s an extraordinary thing to say about a candidate who isn’t running a super PAC, isn’t holding conventional big donor events, and is running on Democratic socialism — that he’s the best-funded candidate in the race.

michael barbaro

Right. So his fundraising is outpacing his polling, which, correct me if I’m wrong, is quite unusual in politics.

alexander burns

Right. And you basically only see it when you have these candidates who have a limited but unbelievably passionate base of support.

michael barbaro

So it feels like Bernie Sanders is kind of a test case for why genuine enthusiasm matters so much in politics.

alexander burns

His supporters are willing to do things for him that other candidate’s supporters may not be. He is going to have an easier time staying financially competitive, mobilizing volunteers, and especially in some of these early voting, cold weather states in February, getting them to actually show up and caucus in Iowa in a blizzard, if necessary.

michael barbaro

They’ll do it.

alexander burns

They’ll do it.

michael barbaro

So the next thing that Jess asked voters about at this Sanders rally was this heart attack that Sanders had a couple of weeks ago.

jessica cheung This is its first rally since he just came back from a heart attack. I wonder if you think that that makes him less electable in any way? speaker 1 I don’t think age matters. I think that’s just stupid. Like, I don’t know why people care about that. speaker 2 No, because he came back stronger. And it was a routine procedure that many people go through. speaker 3 I know a lot of people that have had stents put in, and then felt better afterwards than before. And I think he looked great, so I’m going to stick with him. speaker 4 Well, the curious thing is that Bernie, having undergone this procedure, may feel, like, 110 percent better than he did before. Just the amount of literal blood flowing to his heart may give him a level of energy and stamina that he didn’t feel before he underwent the procedure. And he’s — speaker 5 I saw him play softball! speaker 6 I don’t think that our current president has the best health, so why are we worried so much about a heart attack that wasn’t a big deal? He went right back into it afterwards. speaker 7 Both George Bush Sr. and Clinton had the same operation done in their ‘60s, so — jessica cheung He’s also pushing 80, though. speaker 8 He is, but I mean, it doesn’t — I don’t — I’m not thinking about age. I’m thinking about — speaker 9 There’s a pretty heavy bias against Bernie Sanders because he’s a fairly unique candidate. Like, Joe Biden’s eye exploded while we were all watching a debate, and they didn’t single him out with a question like, hey, Joe, like, why did your eye explode? Like, is it going to happen again?

michael barbaro

Did I miss something? Did Joe Biden’s eye suffer some kind of explosion?

alexander burns

There was a CNN town hall where he had some kind of burst capillary in his eye or something like that. It was unsightly, but —

michael barbaro

Something did happen.

alexander burns

— not medically serious, yeah.

michael barbaro

So in summary, it feels like Sanders supporters in this crowd, they are not concerned about this heart attack. And I wonder what you think of the way it was discussed?

alexander burns

I think right after the heart attack happened, there was this moment of questioning, would Sanders persist in this race? Would his support collapse because people suddenly realize he’s almost 80 years old? Would his health become the defining issue of his candidacy? And at least for his supporters, the answer to all those things is no. They are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt on so much, and his physical health is not an exception to that. I think that you hear people giving rationalizations. It’s true that Bill Clinton had a similar operation. It was after he was the president of the United States. But the reality is a candidate having a heart attack is a really big deal. And historically, by any standard of political coverage, it is more than in bounds as a subject for scrutiny and for voters to consider. We’ve never had a president turn 80 in office before. We have two candidates in this race — two of the top three candidates in this race — would turn 80 in their first term as president if they were elected. People remember, I think, pretty well Hillary Clinton fainting at the 9/11 Memorial in the middle of the general election in 2016.

michael barbaro

I think she had pneumonia.

alexander burns

She had pneumonia. And you know, the Clinton campaign, I think, is still quite resentful of the way that was covered, but a candidate collapsing in the middle of a general election is a relevant subject for coverage. President Trump’s lack of transparency about his health has been a huge subject for coverage over the last few years. There’s enormous suspicion about whether we really know everything that we deserve to know about the president’s health. So this is not bias against Bernie Sanders, but the fact that people are inclined to see it as bias against Bernie Sanders, again, underscores the strength of his support.

michael barbaro

So you mentioned Hillary Clinton in 2016. Jessica encountered a lot of supporters who very much wanted to go back to that race and talk about what happened the last time around. And I want to play some of that.

speaker 1 We need to get Bernie elected this time around. The D.N.C. screwed him over in 2016. He was robbed of the nomination. So people want Bernie. speaker 2 I think it’s the race we needed to have in 2016. I think there’s a populist feel going on. The elites are destroying the country. And the Democrats lost because we ran an elitist. And now, it’s time to run a candidate with a multiracial working-class coalition. speaker 3 He knows that the Democrats are just as corrupt as Republicans, because there has been evidence that the D.N.C. did screw with caucuses — that in Seattle, he won by a landslide, but the delegates voted for Hillary anyway.

michael barbaro

So Alex, what do you make of that?

alexander burns

I think there are a lot of myths about the role of the D.N.C. in 2016, but the valid core to all of that is the sense among Sanders supporters — and this is really not up for debate — that the Democratic Party establishment did everything they could to give Hillary Clinton an advantage over him in that primary.

michael barbaro

Remind us of that, just so we can have it in hand.

alexander burns

You had everyone at the top of the party, including President Obama, do what they could to clear the field for Hillary Clinton. You had the leadership of the party in both houses of Congress try to clear the way for Hillary Clinton. You had other kinds of coordination between party officials who were supposed to be neutral, who were ostensibly neutral, and leaders of the Clinton campaign in ways that none of it was illegal and none of it was outside of the American political tradition, but if you’re a Bernie Sanders supporter, and you looked at that, and you felt like there ought to be an even playing field in this race, there wasn’t.

michael barbaro

I wonder how that makes a Bernie Sanders supporter relate to the Democratic Party and to everyone else in the field who identifies as a Democrat, especially if Sanders starts to falter.

alexander burns

This is one of the Trumpiest things about Bernie Sanders and his political movement — that in 2015, 2016, one of the best predictors of support for Donald Trump in the Republican primary was dislike for the Republican Party. He is obviously now come to embody the Republican Party, so that dynamic has changed, but you have a lot of people in the Democratic Party or on the left who are Democratic primary voters supporting Bernie Sanders and do not like the Democratic Party. It’s something that really frustrates more mainline Democrats — that they feel like Bernie is this interloper who is sort of rousing the left against the only party that really speaks to them. But if you are a Bernie Sanders supporter, you look at the traditional Democratic Party establishment as a collection of people and ideas that have failed.

[music]

michael barbaro

And what about the candidates?

alexander burns

Well, that is one of the great questions of this race — if Bernie is not the nominee, whether his core supporters will embrace another candidate with similar enthusiasm.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

jessica cheung One of the candidates, Elizabeth Warren, shares very similar policy positions. She’s also a liberal populist. I wonder what makes you continue your support for Bernie over Elizabeth Warren? speaker 1 Warren calls herself a capitalist, and she’s not out for a political revolution. I don’t know if I trust Warren. speaker 2 It’s hard to believe her when she still doesn’t have a Medicare for all policy on her website. speaker 3 It seems like now that she’s kind of just adopting a lot of the things that he was saying his whole life, pretty much. speaker 4 She is taking all of Bernie’s policies and kind of putting a spin on it. And it’s like, do you have any original ideas? And if she believed in these things, why wasn’t she supporting them four years ago? speaker 5 And you know, Warren used to be a Republican. speaker 6 Warren used to be a Republican. speaker 7 She was a Republican, and so, like, Elizabeth Warren, I feel like, is just a watered-down form of Bernie to try to make her more appealing, but the second the primary is over, she’s just going to pivot.

michael barbaro

Well?

alexander burns

Look, that’s really striking. She’s not been a Republican since I was in primary school, which was a while ago. But the fact that Sanders supporters have latched onto that in the way they have, I think, reflects just the gap in trust between how they feel about Bernie and how they feel about almost literally any other politician, certainly any other politician running for president.

michael barbaro

It still feels surprising to hear Sanders supporters attempt to differentiate a Democratic rival who, on paper, is so ideologically similar.

alexander burns

I think there are some important ideological distinctions, at least in the abstract. That I think in Elizabeth Warren’s ideal world, we would be a heavily regulated, heavily enforced, free-market economy — that it would be something similar to an F.D.R., Teddy Roosevelt kind regulatory regime. Bernie Sanders would, I think in his ideal world, have us much closer to a sort of Scandinavian social democracy, which is a really fundamentally different way of approaching government. And part of this is a dynamic that happens in primaries generally — that the candidates who are ideologically closest together can end up having the most sort of intense hostility between their supporters because they feel like only one of these people can emerge from this. And they’re right. But there is I think also a level of seeing the trees, but not the forest here, where you have the number two and number three candidates in this Democratic primary, if they were nominated, would be the most liberal nominee in, certainly, my lifetime and in lifetimes a good deal longer than mine as well. So the level of frustration does seem sort of out of proportion to what the downside of an Elizabeth Warren nomination would be.

michael barbaro

So Alex, to your point about the forest for the trees, Jess asked a lot of these voters, if Sanders doesn’t win, are you fine voting for anybody else in the party who becomes the nominee? And this is what people said.

jessica cheung And who is your second candidate of choice? speaker 1 Elizabeth Warren. speaker 2 If Bernie can’t make it, I’m happy with Elizabeth. speaker 3 If either Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders win the nomination, I would be so happy. And I think it would be, again, a sign of how much the Democratic Party is shifting. speaker 4 I do like Elizabeth Warren’s policies. And like, if Elizabeth Warren is the nominee, I’ll happily vote for her.

michael barbaro

So a lot of them, despite their skepticism of Warren, say, if I had to, I would vote for Elizabeth Warren. But then there were several voters who said that they would be very hard-pressed to turn out for anyone who wasn’t Bernie or what they consider to be kind of Bernie-lite, which is Warren.

speaker Sure, so I like Liz Warren. I think she’s probably the only other candidate I would ever even consider supporting. The rest of them, I find to be rather embarrassing. jessica cheung If it wasn’t Bernie, who’s your second candidate of choice? speaker If it wasn’t, I would probably vote for Elizabeth, if she was the candidate. I wouldn’t vote for Biden.

michael barbaro

That’s really interesting.

alexander burns

It really is. And I guess as they say in the Senate, I should revise and extend what I said about people sort of missing the forest — that you do hear people there sort of recognizing that the party as a whole has moved, that there are candidates besides Bernie, although clearly anyone else would be the second-best choice in this race for them. But I think what you heard is how hard it will be for a candidate who is not an economic populist to speak to this set of voters, that if you end up with a candidate who is an avowed centrist or a nominee who has repudiated what Bernie Sanders stands for — hasn’t just revised or watered down his views, but has rejected them and attacked them — that’s going to be a real challenge in the general election. I think one of the calculations the Democrats have traditionally made — certainly made in 2016 — is that the left will come home at the end of the day. And I think you saw in 2016, that was a risky bet to make.

michael barbaro

Right. I mean, that was a bet that just did not come true, because when Sanders supporters were asked to support Hillary Clinton, many of them did not. In fact, as we know from Times analysis, a meaningful number of them voted for Trump.

alexander burns

In the 2016 primary, it wasn’t just liberals who voted for Sanders in the Democratic primary. There were people who were just sort of disaffected and outside the system, people who wanted a populist, not necessarily somebody who is an ideological liberal as we traditionally think of it, people who just didn’t like Hillary Clinton. And then in the general election, there were people who were Democrats, who just weren’t enthusiastic. They would have turned out to vote for Bernie Sanders, would’ve volunteered for Bernie Sanders, would have donated to Bernie Sanders. And when you start to look at the margins of defeat for Hillary Clinton in the states that made the difference — Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania — could Democratic enthusiasm have turned out an additional 70,000 voters? Very possibly.

michael barbaro

So not to be too prescriptive, but based on everything you’re saying, if Joe Biden is the nominee, it will be a challenge, maybe a significant challenge, for this group of voters to be won over and transferred to him. If it is Elizabeth Warren, that will be more logical, although it will not necessarily be seamless.

alexander burns

I think that’s probably a safe bet. And if you’re Joe Biden, you know, maybe you can bring these people around, maybe you need to make up for a lack of enthusiasm on the left by winning over voters closer to the political middle, even folks on the center-right. That’s clearly a bet that candidates like Joe Biden are making — that if Bernie has his populist following that would be much more enthusiastic about him than about me, well, I have moderates who will never vote for a Democratic socialist, but who I can turn out in a general election. And in a lot of ways, this is the big strategic debate in the Democratic Party right now. We’ve talked a lot about the ideological and policy debates in the party, but sort of fundamental to the Democratic race right now is, are you better off trying to marshal a really enthusiastic and diverse coalition on the left or a more ideologically diverse coalition that is somewhat less reliant on liberal enthusiasm?

[music]

alexander burns

For whoever the nominee is in this election, and I think probably in most elections going forward, just given the ideological and demographic trajectory of the Democratic Party and the country, it’s going to be a recurring challenge for them. How do you harness what Bernie Sanders has created, while also appealing broadly to the voters that you need in order to capture the nomination, because Sanders is not actually doing that right now, and win a general election, which Sanders has never had the chance to try to do? And it’s a particularly important question when you look to the future of the Democratic Party. If you were to sort of make a bet right now about the trajectory of that party over the next few years, it will probably look more and more like the Bernie Sanders base and less and less like the coalition that defeated him in 2016 if the party stays on its current course. This is a group of voters that is very much here to stay. And the question is, do they stay as engaged and enthusiastic Democrats?

michael barbaro

Right, or do they basically start and finish their political journey with Bernie Sanders in a way that doesn’t really help the party?

alexander burns

Do they become passionate lifelong Democratic voters, volunteers, donors, or do they go back to being either casually engaged with politics, or disengaged entirely, or really sort of disgusted with the party as they were in 2016?

michael barbaro

Alex, thank you very much.

alexander burns

Thank you.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (lindsey graham) O.K., I have introduced a resolution today with Senator McConnell. And the purpose of the resolution is to let the House know that the process you’re engaging in regarding the attempted impeachment of President Trump is a substantial deviation from what the House has done in the past.

michael barbaro

The Republican campaign to challenge the legitimacy of the House impeachment inquiry escalated on Thursday, as Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina introduced a resolution condemning it as unorthodox and improper. Graham focused on the closed-door hearings led by Representative Adam Schiff, despite the fact that Republicans themselves conducted closed-door testimony during the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998. And in his latest effort to break the deadlock over Brexit after yet another major delay, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would seek a new general election in December.

archived recording (boris johnson) We’re being very, very reasonable. We’re saying if you genuinely want more time, you can have it. Here it is. But the condition for that is that we all agree to go for a general election on December the 12th.

michael barbaro

Johnson hopes that such an election would give him a popular mandate to carry out his vision of a swift Brexit, despite deep resistance within Parliament, whose support is needed for such an election. In an interview with the BBC, Johnson defended the strategy, which his opponents in Parliament say is a form of political intimidation designed to scare them into supporting his plan.

archived recording But prime minister, it’s not standard behavior. You’re essentially trying to blackmail Parliament with the threat of an election in order to ram through your bill. You could just say, fine, let’s have as long as it takes to get through this line by line in Parliament. Would that not be the responsible thing to do? archived recording (boris johnson) Now, come on. We’ve had three and a half years of this. archived recording Not looking at this bill.

Ms. Warren has become known for her towering stack of policy plans, having offered dozens of proposals on a wide variety of subjects. But on health care, she has not been similarly forthcoming, and her repeated refusal to say whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to help finance Medicare for all has drawn sharp criticism from some of her Democratic presidential rivals.

Given her increasing status as a front-runner in the primary race, Ms. Warren was ce rtain to continue facing challenges on the issue. For weeks, she has sidestepped questions about raising taxes, no matter who was asking and when. But it had been an open question whether it would remain politically tenable for her to continue simply aligning herself with Senator Bernie Sanders’s health care plan while declining to provide any detailed explanation of how she would pay for it.

Ms. Warren brought up the issue of Medicare for all at the end of a town-hall-style event in Iowa on Sunday afternoon. “I plan over the next few weeks to put out a plan that talks about, specifically, the cost of Medicare for all and, specifically, how we pay for it,” she told the crowd at the event, held at Simpson College."

Charles Barone, the group’s chief policy officer, said that while he welcomed big new investments in education, including in teacher pay, he was disappointed that the primary contenders had not tackled specific problems such as weaknesses in how educators are trained to teach children to read.

“There is a political tension between spreading the money around and trying to make strategic investments in certain areas,” he said. “There’s a lot of meat and potatoes, but not a lot of spinach-eating getting proposed.”

Before she entered politics, Ms. Warren suggested a program allowing parents to choose any public school for their children, regardless of where the family lived.

That vision aligned with many in the charter school movement, who see their schools as lifelines for families who cannot afford private school tuition or a home in a coveted school zone.

But in 2016, Ms. Warren, then in her first term as a senator from Massachusetts, spoke out against a ballot referendum that would have raised the cap on the number of charters that could open each year in her home state. She acknowledged that many Massachusetts charter schools were high-performing, but said that opening too many additional charters could reduce funding for traditional public schools.

Ms. Warren and her Democratic rivals are vying for endorsements from teachers’ unions, which generally oppose the expansion of the charter sector. “The focus is on making sure every single neighborhood public school is a great school,” said Bharat Ramamurti, an economic policy adviser to Ms. Warren."
275,By Paul Krugman,"Part, but only part, of the issue involves cost.

Journalists have been badgering Warren to get specific about how much taxes would have to go up to pay for Medicare for all. She has, with considerable justice, insisted that this is a bad way to frame the discussion, since any additional taxes would be offset by savings on the huge premiums workers and their employers now pay for private insurance — on average, more than $20,000 a year for a family plan.

The right question is whether the overall costs facing U.S. families would go up or down. Warren has been claiming that for most families, they would go down, but she hasn’t offered specifics. And this vagueness, which has started to seem like evasiveness, is more of a problem for her than it might be for other politicians. As I said, Warren has made policy seriousness a key aspect of her political persona, so her fogginess on health care really stands out.

The plan in the works will presumably try to dispel that fog, but doing so will be tricky. An independent estimate from the Urban Institute (which is, for what it’s worth, left-leaning) suggests that a highly comprehensive Medicare-for-all plan, similar to what Sanders is proposing, would substantially increase overall health spending, although a more modest plan wouldn’t.

But cost isn’t the only issue — in fact, I’m not sure how important it really is, given that full abolition of private insurance remains unlikely in practice. Also, let’s get real: If Warren gets the Democratic nomination, the outcome of the general election isn’t going to hinge on dueling think tank estimates.

The election might, however, hinge on the support of people who have good private coverage and would be nervous about making a leap into the unknown, no matter how many facts and figures Warren deploys.

So what I’ll want to see is whether Warren gives herself and her party enough flexibility to assuage these concerns. I’m not sure what form that flexibility might take. Maybe something like an extended transition period, with greatly enhanced Obamacare (which might actually be politically doable) in the interim?

Whatever Warren comes up with, this is a crucial moment. There are many excellent things in her overall policy agenda; but she won’t get a chance to do those things unless she can extricate herself from what looks like a health policy trap.

Is Hillary Clinton trolling us?

Over the past two weeks, Mrs. Clinton has called President Trump a “corrupt human tornado.” She’s refused to appear on a panel with Kirstjen Nielsen, the former homeland security secretary best known for separating migrant children from their families. She’s picked a fight with Representative Tulsi Gabbard, suggesting that the Hawaii congresswoman and presidential candidate is a favorite of the Russians. And she’s tweeted a letter mocking Mr. Trump with language that makes it unprintable in this family newsletter.

Welcome to Hillary Unplugged.

For most of her public career, Mrs. Clinton has been constrained by the expectations of her position, be it first lady, senator or secretary of state. Now, after her stunning loss in 2016, it seems she finally feels liberated to speak her mind.

And she’s certainly stirring up a lot of drama while doing it. The two-time Democratic presidential candidate continues to loom large in the psyche of her party — both as heroine and villain.

Some Democrats celebrate seeing Mrs. Clinton giving zero, uh, cares. Others, like Ms. Gabbard, see her criticism as a different kind of badge of honor. Several people who have spoken to Ms. Gabbard say privately that her team loves the controversy, seeing Mrs. Clinton as a perfect establishment foil for their stuck-in-the-single-digits campaign."

If the Russians think there is something to be gained by indirectly or directly supporting someone, why wouldn’t they?

You’re a conspiracy theorist, as the saying goes, only if there isn’t a conspiracy.

In her book “American Resistance: From the Women’s March to the Blue Wave,” Dana Fisher, a professor at the University of Maryland, described how a series of “moral shocks” propelled people who hadn’t thought of themselves as activists to join protests. But after three years of Trumpism, it takes more to shock people than it used to. “People have grown accustomed to a certain baseline level of outrage,” Fisher told me.

But that’s far from the whole story. Fisher surveyed people at the Women’s March and other demonstrations, and then tracked them afterward, doing follow-up surveys six months before the midterms and two days after. “All of their levels of civic engagement went up,” she said.

Many had called elected officials and attended town halls. Now, she says, much of the Resistance is focused on organizing for presidential candidates, particularly Elizabeth Warren. “One of the reasons we’re seeing less protest is that protest is being seen as the beginning of activism and political involvement rather than being the end,” she said.

So if America isn’t seeing the sort of huge demonstrations roiling other countries, it’s at least in part because those most fiercely opposed to Trump still believe in the power of our democracy to get rid of him. “People actually trust the election to sort it out,” said Chenoweth. “This is something that’s common in democracies — when you start to see a protest wave really pick up, a lot of time that mobilization really gets filtered into the next election.”

But the next election is a year away, and American democracy is in danger now.

Charles Barone, the group’s chief policy officer, said that while he welcomed big new investments in education, including in teacher pay, he was disappointed that the primary contenders had not tackled specific problems such as weaknesses in how educators are trained to teach children to read.

“There is a political tension between spreading the money around and trying to make strategic investments in certain areas,” he said. “There’s a lot of meat and potatoes, but not a lot of spinach-eating getting proposed.”

Before she entered politics, Ms. Warren suggested a program allowing parents to choose any public school for their children, regardless of where the family lived.

That vision aligned with many in the charter school movement, who see their schools as lifelines for families who cannot afford private school tuition or a home in a coveted school zone.

But in 2016, Ms. Warren, then in her first term as a senator from Massachusetts, spoke out against a ballot referendum that would have raised the cap on the number of charters that could open each year in her home state. She acknowledged that many Massachusetts charter schools were high-performing, but said that opening too many additional charters could reduce funding for traditional public schools.

Ms. Warren and her Democratic rivals are vying for endorsements from teachers’ unions, which generally oppose the expansion of the charter sector. “The focus is on making sure every single neighborhood public school is a great school,” said Bharat Ramamurti, an economic policy adviser to Ms. Warren."

Comes the reply: You mean the book about the … rabbits?

Yes, I do, and that frequency of that reply is another reason for this column.

The anthropologically inclined can approach the book as a portrait of a lost hominid subspecies, complete with its own mythology and linguistic tics, and gradually accustom themselves to the references to hind legs, ears and burrows.

But really the reader should just come for an exercise in epic storytelling — Odyssean adventure and Aeneidan dramaturgy — that exceeds most modern imitations of the classics. One of the virtues of reading a narrative aloud, to children or indeed to anyone, is the way that vocalizing a story clarifies its power, especially in the quavering passion that you try to keep from your voice (because you don’t want your kids to think their dear dad is too emotional) but that bleeds through in spite of everything.

Journalists have been badgering Warren to get specific about how much taxes would have to go up to pay for Medicare for all. She has, with considerable justice, insisted that this is a bad way to frame the discussion, since any additional taxes would be offset by savings on the huge premiums workers and their employers now pay for private insurance — on average, more than $20,000 a year for a family plan.

The right question is whether the overall costs facing U.S. families would go up or down. Warren has been claiming that for most families, they would go down, but she hasn’t offered specifics. And this vagueness, which has started to seem like evasiveness, is more of a problem for her than it might be for other politicians. As I said, Warren has made policy seriousness a key aspect of her political persona, so her fogginess on health care really stands out.

The plan in the works will presumably try to dispel that fog, but doing so will be tricky. An independent estimate from the Urban Institute (which is, for what it’s worth, left-leaning) suggests that a highly comprehensive Medicare-for-all plan, similar to what Sanders is proposing, would substantially increase overall health spending, although a more modest plan wouldn’t.

But cost isn’t the only issue — in fact, I’m not sure how important it really is, given that full abolition of private insurance remains unlikely in practice. Also, let’s get real: If Warren gets the Democratic nomination, the outcome of the general election isn’t going to hinge on dueling think tank estimates.

The election might, however, hinge on the support of people who have good private coverage and would be nervous about making a leap into the unknown, no matter how many facts and figures Warren deploys.

So what I’ll want to see is whether Warren gives herself and her party enough flexibility to assuage these concerns. I’m not sure what form that flexibility might take. Maybe something like an extended transition period, with greatly enhanced Obamacare (which might actually be politically doable) in the interim?

Whatever Warren comes up with, this is a crucial moment. There are many excellent things in her overall policy agenda; but she won’t get a chance to do those things unless she can extricate herself from what looks like a health policy trap.

Paul Krugman is right that a single option version of “Medicare for all” that abolishes existing private health care plans would be politically hazardous. Many of the more than half of the population that is covered by some kind of private health insurance will reflexively not like being told that they will be forced to drop their coverage. Remember how much blowback President Barack Obama received when the media reported that his vow that “ i f you like your health care plan, you can keep it” was not actually true.

Just imagine how many will feel if they are told that they won’t be permitted to keep their health insurance coverage even if they like it. If Senator Elizabeth Warren is indeed so worried about protecting her left flank from Senator Bernie Sanders that she won’t support a less absolutist “public option” plan, then the Democratic Party should choose a different candidate.

Re “Warren Vows to Unveil Single-Payer Specifics” (news article, Oct. 21) and “Favoring Medicare for All, and the Taxes to Pay for It” (news article, Oct. 19):

The media have done a disservice by focusing on raising of taxes to pay for a single-payer health care system rather than focusing on total costs. Currently people pay large sums for health insurance premiums, co-pays, deductibles and prescription drugs. Worse, under the present system, it is estimated that abou t 30 percent of health care costs are for administration, which is double the percentage in Canada.

Under Medicare for all, premiums, co-pays and deductibles would be eliminated. Additionally, the federal government would be able to negotiate drug prices, leading to substantial cost reductions. Taxes will go up, but overall costs to everyone except the very wealthy will go down with a single-payer system. That is, nearly all health care costs will be included in taxes, with minimal other costs for health care."

Chicago is a heavily Democratic city with a long history of backing labor unions. As teachers have marched through downtown and picketed outside schools in recent days, they have often been greeted by supportive car honks and parents offering apple cider and doughnuts. But Ms. Lightfoot and her predecessor, Rahm Emanuel , whose tenure included an especially bitter teachers’ strike in 2012, have struggled to reconcile demands from the union with the bleak finances of the city and the school system.

“Beyond what we put on the table, there is simply no more money,” Ms. Lightfoot said, taking a noticeably harsher tone this week than in the first days of the strike. She added: “Enough is enough. There is no further excuse to keep our kids out of school.”

Ms. Lightfoot suggested that she was unsurprised by Ms. Warren’s arrival, but did not expect it to change much for the city.

“She has her right to come in,” Ms. Lightfoot said. “I would expect all Democratic candidates for the presidency to support workers. That’s who we are as a party. But at the end of the day, what’s going to get it done is what happens at the bargaining table.”

Republicans were also skeptical of the visit.

“Teachers should be wary of any advice Elizabeth Warren may be relaying today in Chicago,” said Kevin Knoth, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee , in a statement that questioned the wisdom of Ms. Warren’s plan for spending billions of dollars more on education.

The Rev. Jesse Jackson , who has attended some of the negotiating sessions to try to help reach a deal, said that the candidates weighing in on Chicago’s strike are recognizing a broader problem in paying for what is needed in schools in communities across the country."

A month later he dismissed criticisms of raising middle class taxes to pay for expanded health care, calling it “a distinction without a difference.”

By October, however, Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., had moved toward the center on all three issues . He has a climate-focused TV ad in which he says, “I believe that we need to have a plan that works for all of us.” The border crossings issue, he told CNN last week, is “the kind of stuff that gets us trapped.” And he’s a month into an attack on Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for not explaining how she’d pay for an overhaul of health care.

For most of his political career, Mr. Buttigieg presented himself as more of a centrist technocrat than a liberal ideologue. But striving for attention in a crowded field, he spent the early part of the 2020 Democratic primary touting an array of aspirational progressive ideas, delivering speeches that could have been ripped from an Aaron Sorkin script.

Now a serious candidate with a policy staff stocked with Washington insiders and a war chest boasting millions from big donors, Mr. Buttigieg has gradually reinvented himself as more of a moderate. While he hasn’t pivoted 180 degrees on policy proposals, he is modulating his positions and drawing explicit and implicit contrasts with his progressive rivals."

Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim of the Federal District Court in San Francisco ordered the Education Department to pay a $100,000 fine. The money will go toward various remedies for students who are owed debt relief after President Barack Obama’s Education Department found they were defrauded by the chain, Corinthian Colleges, which collapsed in 2014.

The ruling is a victory for the more than 60,000 students who have been on a financial roller coaster since Corinthian imploded, after state and federal officials found that it lured students through deceptive recruitment practices and falsified job placement rates.

The decision stems from a class-action lawsuit filed in 2017 by the Project on Predatory Student Lending of the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School and the group Housing and Economic Rights Advocates, both of which represent former Corinthian students. For more than a year, the students’ lawyers argued that Ms. DeVos had illegally punished thousands of cheated students who were owed relief from the federal government."

Dear Mr. Brooks,

It may not be as nerve-racking as you think to vote for Elizabeth Warren. Just remember, the newly elected President Warren will still have to go through Congress to enact her ultraprogressive programs. For example, at the end of the legislative sausage-making we’ll wind up with “Warrencare” just as President Obama wound up with Obamacare, a watered-down version of his original idea, but way better than what we had before. And so it will go with all of Ms. Warren’s very aspirational plans.

Then the fracking revolution came about, and the U.S. resumed its long-lost place as the world’s No. 1 oil and natural gas producer.

The result: lower oil prices for American consumers, less dependence on petrodespots, a dramatic shift from coal to natural gas for electricity generation (with concomitant benefits in carbon emissions), and hundreds of thousands of working-class jobs, including tens of thousands in swing states like Colorado and Pennsylvania.

Elizabeth Warren wants to kill all this.

You don’t have to think that fracking is an unalloyed blessing — much less deny that tough safety standards are necessary — to acknowledge its benefits. You might also argue that curbs on oil and gas production are needed both to preserve the environment and accelerate a transition to renewables. Fine.

Yet it takes a peculiar sort of political audacity to pledge, as the Massachusetts senator did last month, to “ban fracking — everywhere.” Warren also favors a ban on fossil-fuel exports — another U.S. industry that has seen dramatic growth in recent years — and a “total moratorium” on new fossil fuel leases on federal lands, which generate billions every year in federal and state tax revenue."

The funeral was held at New Psalmist Baptist Church in Baltimore, where Mr. Cummings could usually be seen seated in the front row on Sundays. The church seats 4,000 people, but was expected to draw far more for the funeral on Friday.

Terry McAuliffe, the former governor of Virginia and a prolific fund-raiser, said that donors were “furious” about the jet spending and called the campaign’s overall money situation “very alarming.” Mr. McAuliffe’s wife recently invited donors to attend a fund-raiser for Mr. Biden at their home in early November.

Mr. Schultz, when asked about the chartered travel, said that “whatever maximizes Joe Biden and voter interaction, the greater chance we have to win.” T he campaign said Mr. Biden had flown commercial but declined to indicate when his last such flight was.

Just remember, the newly elected President Warren will still have to go through Congress to enact her ultraprogressive programs. For example, at the end of the legislative sausage-making we’ll wind up with “Warrencare” just as President Obama wound up with Obamacare, a watered-down version of his original idea, but way better than what we had before.

A protracted debate over language threatened to scuttle the whole deal. Obama administration officials wanted tests to be the “primary” method of measuring school success. Republicans and the teachers’ unions pushed back. The final compromise allowed states to include several additional measures in their school ratings, including high school graduation rates and metrics of student growth on tests, which give credit when scores improve but still fall short of proficiency.

Each of these indicators must be given “substantial weight” and, collectively, “much greater” weight than another set of newly added indicators that include measures of school safety and student “engagement.”

That’s why Senator Warren’s use of the phrases “significant factor” and “high-stakes decisions” could be, in theory, a big deal. “Significant” sounds a lot like “substantial,” and the identification of low-performing schools for interventions and penalties is generally what people mean when they refer to, or call for the elimination of, “high-stakes testing.”

And yet, when pressed on this question, the Warren campaign repeatedly declined to confirm that those words mean what they seem to mean. A Warren aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, would not say that the Warren plan changes or undoes the 2015 compromise. Instead, the aide referred back to the specific examples cited in the plan, saying that Ms. Warren does not believe tests should be used to close schools or fire teachers.

That means the Warren plan, if enacted, would change very little, because standardized tests are hardly ever used to close schools or fire teachers today. According to Chad Aldeman, an analyst at Bellwether Education Partners, only 231 of the nation’s 98,000 public schools were taken over by the state because of bad test scores during the No Child Left Behind years. Of those, nearly 80 percent were in a single state, Hawaii, which lacks local school districts to do the taking over. Fewer still were converted to charter schools. Even after the Obama administration pushed states to create teacher evaluation systems that incorporated some test data, real-world examples of test-driven systems being used to fire teachers are practically nonexistent.

Two-thirds of public school parents say there is “too much emphasis” on standardized tests in their community’s schools. Nearly half believe parents should be able to excuse their children from taking such tests, a sentiment fueling the testing “Opt Out” movement in New York and elsewhere. President Obama called for a cap on the amount of time students spend taking tests, a move Ms. Warren supported."

Then the fracking revolution came about, and the U.S. resumed its long-lost place as the world’s No. 1 oil and natural gas producer.

The result: lower oil prices for American consumers, less dependence on petrodespots, a dramatic shift from coal to natural gas for electricity generation (with concomitant benefits in carbon emissions), and hundreds of thousands of working-class jobs, including tens of thousands in swing states like Colorado and Pennsylvania.

Elizabeth Warren wants to kill all this.

You don’t have to think that fracking is an unalloyed blessing — much less deny that tough safety standards are necessary — to acknowledge its benefits. You might also argue that curbs on oil and gas production are needed both to preserve the environment and accelerate a transition to renewables. Fine.

Yet it takes a peculiar sort of political audacity to pledge, as the Massachusetts senator did last month, to “ban fracking — everywhere.” Warren also favors a ban on fossil-fuel exports — another U.S. industry that has seen dramatic growth in recent years — and a “total moratorium” on new fossil fuel leases on federal lands, which generate billions every year in federal and state tax revenue."

Taking aim at Mr. Trump’s family, Mr. Biden said, “Look, I wasn’t raised to go after the children. Their actions speak for themselves,” adding, “If I’m president, get elected president, my children are not going to have offices in the White House. My children are not going to sit in on cabinet meetings,” Mr. Biden said.

“It’s just simply improper because you should make it clear to the American public that everything you’re doing is for them,” Mr. Biden said. “And the idea that you’re going to have his children, his son-in-law, et cetera, engaged in the day-to-day operation of things they know nothing about.”

The president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, should not be negotiating Middle East peace, Mr. Biden said. “What credentials does he bring to that?”

With little more than three months until the first caucus, in Iowa, most national public polls show Mr. Biden leading his top opponents, Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, although one poll recently placed Ms. Warren at the head of the pack.

Asked whether he was worried that his opponents were exciting young voters by offering dramatic change, Mr. Biden said that while he wants young people engaged , older voters — a demographic in which Mr. Biden has considerable support — will ultimately control the outcome of the nomination ra ce.

“Overwhelmingly, people over the age of 50 vote in these primaries,” Mr. Biden said. He also took aim at his rivals for what he called far-reaching assertions."

Mr. Schultz, the Biden campaign manager, said in an interview on Friday that Mr. Biden was facing a financial situation unlike any other Democrat: He is taking incoming fire from both the White House and primary opponents on a daily basis, and needs to play both offense and defense within the limits of $2,800 maximum donations .

“We can’t both do a general election and primary. And no one can ,” Mr. Schultz said . Of his rivals who have denounced the super PAC reversal, he added, “If they were being attacked with $10 million-plus of outside money in a general election sense, I would love to see what they would do.”

Mr. Biden’s allies are not only concerned about his fund-raising: There’s also the spending . Mr. Biden raised $15.7 million in the third quarter, but he spent $2 million more than that. Among his biggest expenses was more than $920,000 on chartered jets.

Terry McAuliffe, the former governor of Virginia and a prolific fund-raiser, said that donors were “furious” about the jet spending and called the campaign’s overall money situation “very alarming.” Mr. McAuliffe’s wife recently invited donors to attend a fund-raiser for Mr. Biden at their home in early November.

Mr. Schultz, when asked about the chartered travel, said that “whatever maximizes Joe Biden and voter interaction, the greater chance we have to win.” T he campaign said Mr. Biden had flown commercial but declined to indicate when his last such flight was.

The pressure over money is bound to intensify as the leading Democratic campaigns compete in the early voting states and the extraordinarily expensive media markets of Super Tuesday states like California. Ms. Warren, currently Mr. Biden’s top rival, has already reserved $2.3 million more in television ads in the early voting states than he has, according to Advertising Analytics, a media-tracking firm . In the last 30 days, she spent twice as much as Mr. Biden on Facebook ads, while Mr. Buttigieg spent more than three times as much as Mr. Biden , who has begun buying more online ads after he sharply scaled back his digital spending over the summer."

A protracted debate over language threatened to scuttle the whole deal. Obama administration officials wanted tests to be the “primary” method of measuring school success. Republicans and the teachers’ unions pushed back. The final compromise allowed states to include several additional measures in their school ratings, including high school graduation rates and metrics of student growth on tests, which give credit when scores improve but still fall short of proficiency.

Each of these indicators must be given “substantial weight” and, collectively, “much greater” weight than another set of newly added indicators that include measures of school safety and student “engagement.”

That’s why Senator Warren’s use of the phrases “significant factor” and “high-stakes decisions” could be, in theory, a big deal. “Significant” sounds a lot like “substantial,” and the identification of low-performing schools for interventions and penalties is generally what people mean when they refer to, or call for the elimination of, “high-stakes testing.”

And yet, when pressed on this question, the Warren campaign repeatedly declined to confirm that those words mean what they seem to mean. A Warren aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, would not say that the Warren plan changes or undoes the 2015 compromise. Instead, the aide referred back to the specific examples cited in the plan, saying that Ms. Warren does not believe tests should be used to close schools or fire teachers.

That means the Warren plan, if enacted, would change very little, because standardized tests are hardly ever used to close schools or fire teachers today. According to Chad Aldeman, an analyst at Bellwether Education Partners, only 231 of the nation’s 98,000 public schools were taken over by the state because of bad test scores during the No Child Left Behind years. Of those, nearly 80 percent were in a single state, Hawaii, which lacks local school districts to do the taking over. Fewer still were converted to charter schools. Even after the Obama administration pushed states to create teacher evaluation systems that incorporated some test data, real-world examples of test-driven systems being used to fire teachers are practically nonexistent.

Two-thirds of public school parents say there is “too much emphasis” on standardized tests in their community’s schools. Nearly half believe parents should be able to excuse their children from taking such tests, a sentiment fueling the testing “Opt Out” movement in New York and elsewhere. President Obama called for a cap on the amount of time students spend taking tests, a move Ms. Warren supported."

In a study presented as an abstract at this meeting, researchers looked at national survey data about the sleep habits of 49,050 children from 6 to 17, to see how many were getting enough sleep. They used the A.A.P. guidelines for sufficient sleep: a minimum of nine hours a night for younger children and eight for adolescents.

Dr. Hoi See Tsao, a pediatric emergency medicine fellow at Hasbro Children’s Hospital and the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, who was the lead author on the study, got interested in the subject when she worked as a teacher and noticed that many of her students were tired in class. The researchers found that 31.9 percent of the 13- to 17-year-olds did not get sufficient sleep.

The study looked at the association between how much sleep kids were getting and whether they appeared to be “flourishing” according to several measures. When parents and caretakers were asked about how their children were doing, the adolescents who were not getting eight hours of sleep a night had a 34 percent increase in the odds of not showing interest or curiosity about learning new things, a 34 percent increase in the odds of not staying calm when faced with a challenge, and a 36 percent increase in the odds of not doing all their required homework.

Younger children who were not getting sufficient sleep (that is, an average of nine hours on weeknights for those 6 to 12) also had higher chances of not showing these flourishing markers — in fact, their parents were 61 percent more likely to report that they did not show interest in learning new things.

This is a cross-sectional study, which shows association, not causation, but “it reinforces the importance of having children get enough sleep, the importance of setting good bedtime routines, a good sleep environment,” Dr. Tsao said. This may mean changes in the home, she said, but also advocacy on a community level, changes in the school system — school start times, homework loads — and a rethinking of how fully scheduled the days of children and adolescents ought to be.

[In California, a new law will shift school start times to help teens get more sleep.]

The consequences of sleep deprivation in adolescence include daytime fatigue, which can look like low energy and be marked by falling asleep in school, or like poor concentration and inattention. “The parent may be thinking the teen has A.D.H.D.,” Dr. Spinks-Franklin said, but in fact, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is not something that develops suddenly in adolescence. And in addition to poor concentration, sleep deprivation may contribute to poor executive function, and an increased tendency toward bad judgment.

For some adolescents, this results in a more extreme picture, delayed sleep phase syndrome, in which they stay up later and later, trying to catch up by sleeping in on weekends, but shifting their circadian rhythms further away from being asleep at night and awake during the day. Treatment involves behavioral interventions, consistent wake-ups, scheduling changes and melatonin, but there is a high recurrence rate."

Bernie Sanders put it in starker terms, saying the United States should demand more from Israel.

But whatever the language, one thing was clear: Democratic attitudes toward Israel are shifting in the highest echelons of the party.

Several Democratic presidential hopefuls spoke at a national conference hosted by J Street, a liberal lobbying group that describes itself as “pro-Israel and pro-peace.” Thousands of progressive Jewish activists gathered at the two-day conference, as candidates answered questions about what they would do to end the Israeli occupation in the West Bank as well as restart negotiations between Palestinians and the Israeli government. Such negotiations have long been at a standstill.

But any idea must go through the federal bankruptcy court where two camps of investors — one aligned with wildfire victims seeking damages from PG&E, and another with management — have submitted plans to reorganize the company. PG&E, facing an estimated $30 billion or more in liabilities, mainly from fires in 2017 and 2018, sought bankruptcy protection in January. Its stock soared in the following months. On Wall Street and beyond, there was hope that the reorganization would stabilize PG&E, in tandem with a new state fund intended to keep fire liabilities from overwhelming utilities.

In a study presented as an abstract at this meeting, researchers looked at national survey data about the sleep habits of 49,050 children from 6 to 17, to see how many were getting enough sleep. They used the A.A.P. guidelines for sufficient sleep: a minimum of nine hours a night for younger children and eight for adolescents.

Dr. Hoi See Tsao, a pediatric emergency medicine fellow at Hasbro Children’s Hospital and the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, who was the lead author on the study, got interested in the subject when she worked as a teacher and noticed that many of her students were tired in class. The researchers found that 31.9 percent of the 13- to 17-year-olds did not get sufficient sleep.

The study looked at the association between how much sleep kids were getting and whether they appeared to be “flourishing” according to several measures. When parents and caretakers were asked about how their children were doing, the adolescents who were not getting eight hours of sleep a night had a 34 percent increase in the odds of not showing interest or curiosity about learning new things, a 34 percent increase in the odds of not staying calm when faced with a challenge, and a 36 percent increase in the odds of not doing all their required homework.

Younger children who were not getting sufficient sleep (that is, an average of nine hours on weeknights for those 6 to 12) also had higher chances of not showing these flourishing markers — in fact, their parents were 61 percent more likely to report that they did not show interest in learning new things.

This is a cross-sectional study, which shows association, not causation, but “it reinforces the importance of having children get enough sleep, the importance of setting good bedtime routines, a good sleep environment,” Dr. Tsao said. This may mean changes in the home, she said, but also advocacy on a community level, changes in the school system — school start times, homework loads — and a rethinking of how fully scheduled the days of children and adolescents ought to be.

[In California, a new law will shift school start times to help teens get more sleep.]

The consequences of sleep deprivation in adolescence include daytime fatigue, which can look like low energy and be marked by falling asleep in school, or like poor concentration and inattention. “The parent may be thinking the teen has A.D.H.D.,” Dr. Spinks-Franklin said, but in fact, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is not something that develops suddenly in adolescence. And in addition to poor concentration, sleep deprivation may contribute to poor executive function, and an increased tendency toward bad judgment.

For some adolescents, this results in a more extreme picture, delayed sleep phase syndrome, in which they stay up later and later, trying to catch up by sleeping in on weekends, but shifting their circadian rhythms further away from being asleep at night and awake during the day. Treatment involves behavioral interventions, consistent wake-ups, scheduling changes and melatonin, but there is a high recurrence rate."

I always say that the main difficulty is fighting with someone who despises Donald Trump even more than I do. Then I add that if things get too convivial, I just bring up Elizabeth Warren.

Bret: Thank goodness for that.

Gail: I don’t find the field all that disheartening. I think Warren could be a very good president. I do worry about electability. But she’s getting to be a better campaigner every day. And if Biden demonstrates over the next months that he can hang in there and take care of business, I’m fine with him. Buttigieg is too young and green, but if the primary voters don’t care, I’m good with him as president. The only serious candidate I have real reservations about is Bernie Sanders, who does not seem to play all that well with others. But compared with Donald Trump, he’s Franklin Roosevelt."

The issue is a talking point among Democratic presidential candidates. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) has called for a nationwide ban on police use of facial recognition. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) have both called for regulations on facial-recognition technology as part of their criminal-justice platforms.

Also worrying for corporations is a bill that Sen. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.) and Sen. Brian Schatz (D., Hawaii) introduced in March. The Commercial Facial Recognition Privacy Act would limit companies’ ability to share facial-recognition data and would prohibit the use of the technology unless a business obtains consent from the people it is used on and provides notice and documentation explaining how the technology works. The bill hasn’t made it to a committee vote.

Nine industry groups—including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Security Industry Association and the American Association of Airport Executives—sent a letter dated Oct. 16 to more than a dozen House and Senate lawmakers urging them not to support strict limits on the use of facial-recognition technology.

“[W]e are concerned that a moratorium on the use of facial recognition technology would be premature and have unintended consequences not only for innovation, safety, and security but for the continued improvement of the technology’s accuracy and effectiveness,” the letter said.

Retailers, airports, stadiums and other businesses have already started rolling out facial-recognition tools to improve security and speed up customer check-ins.

“We’re not opposed to regulation, but we oppose a ban,” said Tim Day, senior vice president of the Chamber of Commerce’s Technology Engagement Center. “There should be guardrails in place to allow the technology to move forward in a smart way.”

The Chamber has convened a facial-recognition working group of about 40 companies from sectors including retail and transportation. The group plans to release model legislation for facial recognition by year-end and to lobby lawmakers to draft and vote for laws that are in line with those guidelines, Mr. Day said.

San Francisco; Oakland, Calif.; and Somerville, Mass., have passed laws banning government agencies from using the technology.

California has prohibited facial-recognition software in police body cameras: Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed the bill into law this month. The legislation, which becomes effective in January and expires after three years, doesn’t apply to the private sector.

Some companies, meanwhile, are pointing to the benefits that facial recognition brings.

Miami International Airport, which is affiliated with Airports Council International—North America, has cut passenger screening wait times by up to 80% over the past year, thanks in part to a biometrics-only concourse screening facility, according to a Miami-Dade Aviation Department spokesman.

In January, the airport started using the technology for entry screening on up to 10 international flights a day, and it is testing facial recognition for boarding on “a few daily flights,” the spokesman said. The plan is to eventually expand both programs airport-wide.

Such programs would be hampered if facial recognition bans were passed, Mr. Day said.

In Europe, laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation, which prohibits companies from processing facial-recognition data unless certain circumstances apply, have slowed and in some cases halted the rollout of the technology, said Heikki Koski, chief digital officer at Finavia, the state-owned operator of 21 Finnish airports.

Helsinki Airport is undergoing a €1 billion ($1.11 billion) expansion set to be completed in 2022, and it is considering using facial recognition in new check-in and security facilities, Mr. Koski said. But aviation officials haven’t decided whether to proceed because of the challenges of complying with strict data-privacy laws.

Under the GDPR, organizations can be fined up to €20 million or 4% of global annual revenue, whichever is larger. In August, the Swedish Data Protection Authority fined a municipality about €20,000 for conducting a facial-recognition pilot to keep track of students’ school attendance.

The Swedish authority found that the pilot violated the GDPR. The school failed to perform an adequate impact assessment and consult with Swedish privacy authorities before processing biometric data, it said. Consent from the students wasn’t valid, it added, because of the “clear imbalance” between the students and the school.

“There are many obstacles to solve before we will see widespread implementation here,” Mr. Koski said.
