## Executable scripts

The scrapers folder contains the scraping scripts we created to automate the API request process.  These scripts require API key's via a config file for the NewsApi. Their are several versions floating around inside the scraper as we attempted to split up some of the scraping requests in order to stay under query request limits.  The results from the API requests are stored as csv's in the [data_csvs folder](https://github.com/mburke65/Data_698_Final/tree/master/data_csvs)
